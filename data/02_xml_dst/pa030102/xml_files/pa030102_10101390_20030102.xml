<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The related art for removing a bubble by negative-pressure suction including the related arts 1 and 6 to 8 has the following disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the suction unit is necessary, the mechanism is complicated and the waste ink amount is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To realize highly fine image quality such as a picture, a recording head for discharging a small amount of ink droplet is necessary. In such a recording head, the section of the ink discharge opening and the individual channel is a circle having a diameter of about several &mgr;m to several tens of &mgr;m or a rectangle having one side of about several &mgr;m to several tens of &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The cross-sectional area of the individual channel is reduced to increase the channel resistance.

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The related art for removing a bubble by the dummy nozzles has the following disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The recording head is larger since the ink discharge opening not contributing to printing is formed. When the negative pressure in the recording head is high, a bubble is suctioned into the common liquid chamber from the ink discharge opening for the dummy nozzle with a large cross-sectional area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The construction of the related art 2 has the disadvantage that the pressurizing heater is necessary so that the device is complicated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the construction of the related art 4, since the heater is driven by an excessive energy as compared with ink discharge for normal printing, there arises the problem in the reliability of the electric circuit and the life of the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the construction of the related art 5, since printing is stopped together with bubble production, the printing processing ability is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The related art for preventing clogging has the following disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the construction of the related art 9, since the pressurizing unit is necessary, the device is larger and the device cost is increased. Ink can be leaked from the ink supply passage connection part by pressure at pressurization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> To eliminate the above disadvantages, the present invention provides an ink jet recording device and a bubble removing method which can prevent image deficiency by a simplified construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the present invention, an ink jet recording device has: an ink jet recording head provided with a common liquid chamber to which ink is supplied from outside, individual channels communicated to the common liquid chamber each having an ink discharge opening formed in a front end thereof, and heating elements disposed in the individual channels discharging an ink droplet by heating ink; and a driving unit which applies a driving energy to the heating elements until ink present in the common liquid chamber is boiled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A bubble produced in the common liquid chamber by a printing operation grows by the printing operation to clog the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber. Ink supply to the individual channel can be inhibited, resulting in possible image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The driving unit drives the heating elements until a bubble is escaped from the common liquid chamber to the ink supply side. Ink in the common liquid chamber is boiled. The ink surface tension is lowered. The attaching force of the bubble to the wall surface is reduced. The bubble is expanded to increase the floating force. The bubble is spaced from the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber. The heating elements are used to boil ink so that the image quality deficiency can be recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The driving unit may apply an ink discharging energy to the heating elements to continuously perform non-printing ink droplet discharge, thereby boiling ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this case, the ink refill of the individual channel cannot cover the discharged ink due to the ink temperature rise. The ink meniscus position is backed to the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As a result, the heating elements are driven in no ink state to increase the temperature. Ink in the common liquid chamber is boiled. The ink surface tension is lowered in the individual channel edge of the common liquid chamber. The bubble is expanded to increase the floating force. The bubble is spaced from the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber. The image quality deficiency can be recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The driving unit may apply an energy smaller than the ink discharging energy for heating the recording head without discharging ink to the heating elements to boil ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this case, no ink droplets are discharged from the ink discharge opening. In this state, the heating elements are driven until ink in the common liquid chamber is boiled. The ink surface tension is lowered due to the ink temperature rise. The attaching force of the bubble to the wall surface is reduced. The bubble is expanded to increase the floating force. The bubble is spaced from the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber. The image quality deficiency can be recovered. In addition, since ink discharge is not performed in order to boil ink, the waste ink amount by bubble removal can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a temperature detection unit which detects a temperature of the recording head. The temperature detection unit detects that the temperature of the recording head reaches a set boiling temperature, whereby the driving unit stops applying the driving energy to the heating elements. Ink in the common liquid chamber can be boiled reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this case, the set boiling temperature may be equal to or above an ink boiling point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In general, when the temperature of the recording head is equal to or above the set boiling temperature, the ink temperature in the common liquid chamber in the recording head becomes equal to or above the boiling point to boil ink. The heating elements are driven until the temperature of the recording head reaches the set boiling temperature so as to remove a bubble clogging the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The ink boiling point may be about 100&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the case of an aqueous ink, the boiling point is about 100&deg; C. The heating elements are driven until the temperature of the recording head reaches about 100&deg; C. Ink in the common liquid chamber can be boiled reliably. A bubble clogging the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> After detecting that the temperature of the recording head reaches the set boiling temperature, the temperature detection unit may detect that the temperature of the recording head is lowered to a set cooling temperature, whereby the driving unit applies an ink discharging energy to the heating elements to perform non-printing ink droplet discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After ink is boiled, the ink is cooled to be thickened. When the decomposed (thickened) ink is present in the recording head, it leads to clogging and deterioration of printing performance. In the present invention, when ink in the common liquid chamber is boiled, an ink discharging energy is applied to the heating elements after cooling the ink to the set cooling temperature. Thereby the thickened ink is discharged to the outside. The set cooling temperature is a temperature at which the ink meniscus position moved to the common liquid chamber side by boiling returns to a predetermined position, that is, the temperature at which the ink can be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The set boiling temperature may be a temperature at which ink refill cannot cover the discharged ink and an ink meniscus position formed in the individual channel is formed on the common liquid chamber side rather than the heating element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the heating elements are used continuously, the ink refill cannot cover the discharged ink due to the ink temperature rise and the ink meniscus is moved to the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel. As a result, the high temperature ink reaches near the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel. A bubble attached to the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A cross-sectional area of the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel may be smaller than that of a portion where the heating element is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the driving unit drives the heating elements to discharge an ink droplet from the ink discharge opening, the cross-sectional area of the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel is larger than that of a portion where the heating element is disposed. The bubble point pressure is sufficiently high. When the ink meniscus is positioned at the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel, it is possible to prevent air from being suctioned into the common liquid chamber due to the negative pressure of the ink supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have an ink supply chamber provided adjacent to the common liquid chamber in order to supply ink to the common liquid chamber having a volume in which an expanded bubble can be spaced from the common liquid chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A bubble attached to the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber is expanded by the ink temperature rise and spaced from the edge. When the channel for supplying ink into the common liquid chamber is narrow, the expanded bubble can clog the channel to affect ink supply. The ink supply chamber provided adjacent to the common liquid chamber has a volume which can space the expanded bubble from the common liquid chamber. The bubble can be reliably spaced from the common liquid chamber so as to reduce the possibility to affect the ink supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a detection unit which detects a number of printed sheets. When the number of printed sheets reaches a predetermined number of sheets, the driving unit drives the heating element, whereby a temperature of the recording head becomes equal to or above the set temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the common liquid chamber, the bubble is increased with printing. The temperature of the recording head becomes equal to or above the set boiling temperature for each predetermined number of sheets smaller than the number of printed sheets in which the bubble clogs the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber to cause image quality deficiency. The bubble is removed from the common liquid chamber to inhibit image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a detection unit which detects a number of accumulated discharges of ink droplets. When the number of accumulated discharges reaches a predetermined number, the driving unit drives the heating element, whereby a temperature of the recording head becomes equal to or above the set boiling temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the common liquid chamber, the bubble is increased with printing. The temperature of the recording head is becomes equal to or above the set boiling temperature for each predetermined number smaller than the number of accumulated discharges in which the bubble clogs the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber to cause image quality deficiency. The bubble is removed from the common liquid chamber to inhibit image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a head cleaning signal input unit which can input a head cleaning signal to the driving unit from outside. Based on the head cleaning signal inputted from the head cleaning signal input unit, the driving unit drives the heating elements, whereby a temperature of the recording head becomes equal to or above the set boiling temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The user inputs a head cleaning signal from the head cleaning signal input unit to the driving unit. Then the temperature of the recording head becomes equal to or above the set boiling temperature to boil ink in the common liquid chamber. The bubble can be removed reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, an ink jet recording device has: a recording head having a common liquid chamber communicated with an outer ink source and with plural ink channels each having a heating element therein; and a driving unit for driving the heating element, wherein the driving unit applies an energy enough to boil an ink contained in the common liquid chamber near the ink channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The energy may be enough to discharge an ink in the ink channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the energy may not be enough to discharge an ink in the ink channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have: a temperature detector for detecting a temperature of the ink or recording head, wherein the driving unit primarily applies an energy to the heating elements, the energy not being enough to discharge the ink in the common ink chamber until the temperature detector detects a boiling temperature of the ink in the common chamber, and the driving unit secondarily applies an energy to the heating element, the energy being enough to discharge the ink in the common ink chamber after the temperature detector detects the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The driving unit may be controlled in accordance with an operator&apos;s direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a maintenance unit for maintaining the recording head by vacuuming an ink from the ink channels through an ink discharging portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device may further have a control unit for independently controlling the maintenance unit and the driving unit for independent maintenance movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A method may be provided for removing an undesirable bubble formed between a common liquid chamber and ink channels each having a heating element therein in a recording head. The method has the steps of: applying an energy to the heating element until an ink near the ink channels in the common liquid chamber generates a bubble; merging the undesirable bubble and the generated bubble for forming a larger bubble having a relatively large buoyancy in the common liquid chamber; and removing the larger bubble through the common ink chamber due to the buoyancy.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An ink jet recording device according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in an ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an ink jet recording head cartridge (hereinafter, referred to as a cartridge) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> held in a carriage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is scanned along a guide shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the arrow A direction and prints a sheet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> carried tin the arrow B direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> On the front end of the cartridge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a head chip (hereinafter referred to as a recording head) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for discharging an ink droplet is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>A and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed by joining a heating element substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a channel substrate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via a protective layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and basically has plural ink discharge openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed in one end surface (ink discharge surface), individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicated to the ink discharge openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> communicated to all the individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending in the nozzle arrangement direction, and heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, referred to as heating elements) disposed facing the individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An opening portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> communicated to the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is connected to an ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of an ink supply body <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> connected to the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> On the surface of the heating element substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> corresponding to the lower portion of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (the lower side of the protective layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for detecting the temperature of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (ink in the common liquid chamber) is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed with an upstream contraction part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a downstream contraction part <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in which the width of the channel is narrowed on the common liquid chamber side and the ink discharge opening side. This intends to enhance the energy efficiency at ink droplet discharge and to increase the bubble point pressure by reducing the channel width (cross-sectional area). In other words, when a dummy jet (non-printing ink discharge) is performed continuously in the later-described bubble removing control so that the ink refill cannot be attained, ink meniscus (air) is prevented from being included into the common liquid chamber. The ink jet recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this embodiment sets the ink surface tension and the channel cross-sectional area of the upstream contraction part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> so as to provide a bubble point pressure of about 15000 Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling ink discharge and bubble removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a RAM <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which are connected by a bus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> stores a bubble removing control program so as to remove a bubble by drivingly controlling the heating element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> based on this program. The control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to a pulse output device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for outputting a driving pulse signal to the heating element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and a cleaning button <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for the user to command the later-described bubble removing control via the bus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The operation of the thus-constructed ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A printing operation will be described simply. In this case, image data is inputted to the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> outputs a printing driving signal corresponding to the image data to the pulse generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A printing pulse signal having a pulse width of 2.5 &mgr;sec is applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As a result, ink on the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> boils the film to produce a bubble so as to discharge an ink droplet from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this case, the temperature of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is monitored all the time by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. When the temperature reaches the printing limiter temperature, the printing operation is stopped once to lower the temperature to a predetermined temperature for restarting printing. This prevents image quality deficiency discharging no ink droplet in such a manner that the ink refill is slow due to ink temperature rise in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are driven while no ink is on the heating element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The bubble removing control will be described with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Upon turning the power on, the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> detects the temperature of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is then stored into the RAM <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A sheet counter, not shown, of the ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> starts counting the number of accumulated printed sheets (step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Whether printing is being performed or not is judged based on whether an image data signal is inputted to the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or not (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the case of printing, whether the number of accumulated printed sheets reaches N sheets or not is judged (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). The above steps <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are repeated until the number of accumulated printed sheets reaches N sheets. When the number of accumulated printed sheets reaches N sheets, the later-described bubble removing control is performed so as to remove a bubble which clogs the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Since the ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> increases the bubble amount in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with its use, the possibility of causing image quality deficiency is increased. Each time the number of accumulated printed sheets reaches a predetermined number of sheets (N sheets), the later-described bubble removing control is performed, thereby preventing the image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the case of non-printing, whether a cleaning command is inputted from the cleaning button <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or not is judged (step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). When not inputted, the above steps <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are repeated. When the cleaning command is inputted, the later-described bubble removing control is performed (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> When the user sees the printed matter to confirm image quality deficiency and inputs the cleaning command from the cleaning button <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the bubble removing control is performed even when the number of accumulated printed sheets does not reach N sheets, thereby recovering from the image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After terminating the bubble removing control, the sheet counter is reset (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). At the next control, the number of accumulated printed sheets is counted from 0 again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Whether the power is turned off or not is judged (step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) and the above control is repeated until the power is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The bubble removing control will be described in detail with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the case of printing, the CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> outputs a driving stop signal to the pulse generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The output of the pulse signal from the pulse generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is stopped to stop driving (printing operation) of the heating element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A moving signal from the CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is outputted to a carriage driver, not shown, to move the carriage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a dummy jet position P (step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> At this point, the number of accumulated printed sheets reaches N sheets (or a degree to cause image quality deficiency). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 8A</cross-reference>, many bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are produced in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A is attached to the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to clog the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When the printing operation is continued in this state, the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> cannot supply ink to the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, resulting in image quality deficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> sets a short driving pulse signal (pulse width of 1.0 &mgr;sec) which has a pulse width smaller than that of the printing pulse signal (pulse width of 2.5 &mgr;sec). The short driving pulse signal is applied to all the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via the pulse generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to drive the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> N3 times (steps <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). The heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are driven by the short pulse signal (pulse width of 1.0 &mgr;sec) having a pulse width smaller than that of the printing pulse signal (pulse width of 2.5 &mgr;sec). No ink droplets can be discharged from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that ink in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is only heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> With the heating operation, whether the temperature of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, referred to as a head temperature) becomes equal to or above T3 &deg; C. (equal to or above the ink boiling point, for example, 110&deg; C.) or not is judged based on the output of the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The heating operation is repeated N3 times until the head temperature (the ink temperature in the common liquid chamber) reaches T3 &deg; C. (steps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). For example, when N3 times is five times, the head temperature is changed to exceed 110&deg; C. (T3 &deg; C.), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The heating operation is performed continuously to boil the ink in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thereby discharging a bubble outside. This process will be described below. In the conditions described here in which an ink boiling phenomenon occurs in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, to the recording head having a nozzle arrangement of 800 dpi and 512 nozzles in total, a driving pulse signal having a driving frequency of 20 kHz, a driving voltage of 32V, a driving current of 100 mA, and a driving pulse of 2.5 &mgr;sec is inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The head temperature is increased to some extent so that the bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are expanded. Reduction of the ink surface tension decreases the attaching force of the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A to the wall surface of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As a result, the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A is coalesced into other bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to start integration (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 8B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When the heating operation is performed continuously so that the head temperature becomes equal to or above T3 &deg; C., the ink refill cannot be attained to the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. There is provided an idle discharge state in which the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are driven in no ink state in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In other words, the ink meniscus position in all the individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is at the common liquid chamber side edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 8C</cross-reference>, the attached portion of the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A attached to the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is heated abruptly. The attaching force is reduced greatly, and the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A is expanded to be integrated with other bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. An integrated bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B is moved to the upper side of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and then, is moved from the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> When the head temperature exceeds T3 &deg; C., the pulse generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> stops the output of the short driving pulse signal by the stop signal from the CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As a result, the driving of the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is stopped to spontaneously cool the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> until the head temperature is lowered to T4 &deg; C. (for example, 40&deg; C.) (steps <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B increased during the spontaneous cooling period is moved from the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by its floating force. The bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which clog the edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to cause image quality deficiency can be removed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>). The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is cooled to lower the ink temperature and bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>C remaining in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are reduced to a sufficiently small size (smaller than the common liquid chamber side edge section of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The temperature of the ink boiled in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is lowered by spontaneous cooling. When the head temperature is cooled to T4 &deg; C., the printing pulse signal (pulse width of 2.5 &mgr;sec) is applied to all the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to perform a dummy jet N4 times (for example, 3000 times) (step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The carriage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is scanned along the guide shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to slide a wiping member, not shown, and a nozzle surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to remove solidified ink from the nozzle surface (step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Such an operation is performed after cooling the ink. The thickened ink by cooling after boiling can be reliably prevented from being solidified at the nozzle front end to change the ink discharge direction and from allowing the ink not to be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> When the dummy jet and wiping process are terminated, printing is restarted in the case of printing before the bubble removing control and the printing wait state is returned in the case of non-printing (steps <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The operation of the bubble removing control will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The short driving pulse signal is applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> until the head temperature becomes equal to or above T3 &deg; C. at which the ink in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is boiled, and then, continuously drives the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A clogging the individual channel side edge in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is spaced from the wall surface and is integrated with other bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to be moved from the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In particular, a bubble clogging the plural adjacent individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which cannot be discharged from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a normal dummy jet at the individual channel side edge of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be preferably removed from the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> To remove the bubble clogging the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the bubble can be preferably removed by a simplified construction, without providing dummy nozzles for bubble discharge and adding a special unit such as a vacuum device, When boiling the ink in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the short pulse signal (pulse width of 1.0 &mgr;sec) having a pulse width smaller than that of the printing pulse signal (pulse width of 2.5 &mgr;sec) is applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to heat the ink. Ink discharge need not be performed for heating. Ink wasting is avoided and the waste ink can be prevented from being increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The heating operation is performed continuously to increase the head temperature to T3 &deg; C. A bubble can be suctioned from the ink meniscus positioned at the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The upstream contraction part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> having a width smaller than the disposing portion of the heating element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to prevent air from being suctioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The air suction will be described with reference to an ink jet recording head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of a comparative example. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the width of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixed in the ink jet recording head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The heating operation is performed continuously in the above bubble removing control until the head temperature becomes equal to or above T3 &deg; C. Since the channel resistance is lowered, ink meniscus is moved into the common liquid chamber by the negative pressure of the ink supply system to suction air into the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As a result, since the ink in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the ink supply chamber is almost empty, printing (ink discharge) is disabled in all the ink discharge openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. To recover the printable state from this state, the recording head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> must be suctioned by a negative-pressure pump to refill ink to the ink supply chamber, the common liquid chamber, and the individual channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this embodiment forms the upstream contraction part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A dummy jet is performed in the bubble removing control while the ink refill cannot be attained. Since the bubble point pressure of the upstream contraction part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is high, it is possible to reliably prevent the ink meniscus from being included into the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to introduce air (bubble) from outside into the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The above bubble removing control can reliably remove the bubble in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also considered to be constructed below in order to prevent a bubble from being attached to the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to inhibit ink supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, pillars <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are formed on the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> side of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be spaced at fixed intervals (below the channel width of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) in the arrangement direction of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at a fixed distance from the edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Between the pillars <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a path <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is formed in the arrangement direction of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is thus formed. The bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of a size which can clog the common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> cannot pass between the pillars <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and then, are attached to the pillar <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The common liquid chamber side edge of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will not be clogged by the bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Ink can be supplied to the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the path <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from between the pillars <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to which the bubbles <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are not attached (see the arrow of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a short pulse signal not discharging ink is applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to perform the heating operation. The printing pulse signal may be applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for heating by a method for performing non-printing ink discharge (dummy jet). In this case, there is the advantage that only the printing pulse signal can perform the heating operation (bubble removing control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a pulse width to be applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in order to pre-heat the ink is modulated. Another method which can reduce an energy to be applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be used which lowers the applying voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> An ink jet recording device according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. The same components as the first embodiment are indicated by similar reference numerals, and the detailed description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the cartridge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> basically has a recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> similar to the first embodiment, an ink supply body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for supplying ink to the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a heat sink <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for holding heat releasability of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The ink supply body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is of a shape formed with an opening portion in one of corners of the lower end portion of a substantially rectangular parallelepiped box. The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fitted in the opening portion via an elastic seal member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is integrated with the ink supply body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the ink supply body <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an ink tank chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of a substantially rectangular parallelepiped and an ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which are divided into two by a filter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, a sufficiently large volume is held for the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The horizontal section (in the lateral direction in the drawing) is held largely. A bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> moved from the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is floated reliably to be spaced from an ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the ink tank chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, ink can be supplied from a sub ink tank which can be attached or removed on top of the exterior main ink tank and the cartridge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement direction of the cartridge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, at least the ink tank chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) must be arranged in the lower side in the gravitational direction in that order for the bubble removing control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The operation of the thus-constructed ink jet recording device will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The bubble moved from the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> by the above bubble removing control is moved by the floating force of the bubble itself to the upper side in the gravitational direction in the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, that is, to the ink tank chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the volume of the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is held largely. A bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B discharged from the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being attached to the wall surface near the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to inhibit ink supply to the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the section orthogonal in the ink flow direction (the horizontal section) is increased to design the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> below so that the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B is floated reliably against the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The floating force and resistance force acting on the bubble in the ink supply chamber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are considered as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> When a minimum cross-sectional area in the ink flow direction of the ink supply chamber is S, an average ink flow rate during printing is Q, an ink density is &rgr;, a gravitational constant is g, a resistance coefficient is Cd, and a bubble diameter is d, a resistance force acting on a bubble is F1, which is given by the equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> When the floating force F2 acting on the bubble is larger than the resistance force F1 by ink flow (F2&gt;F1), the equation is satisfied as follows:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The bubble rises by its floating force to the upper side in the vertical direction (from the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the head to the filter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> side in this embodiment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In the resistance coefficient Cd, when the Reynolds number Re&lt;1, Cd&equals;24/Re is established. When an ink viscosity is &rgr; and an ink flow velocity is v, the Reynolds number Re is expressed to be Re&equals;&rgr;&times;v&times;d/&mgr;. From the equation (1),</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The bubble diameter d shows a bubble diameter in which the floating force F2 is larger than the resistance force F1 of the ink flow. When the minimum cross-sectional area S is designed so that the bubble diameter d is smaller than the diameter of the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B, thereby reliably floating the bubble <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> To confirm the above operation, a continuous printing operation of a predetermined number of sheets is actually performed in the embodiment (the ink jet recording device of a third embodiment). Thereafter, a change in a bubble amount by performing the bubble removing control shown in the first embodiment is tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The head printing specification of the test example has 512 ink discharge openings (individual channels) at a resolution of 800 dpi.

<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in the embodiment, after continuous printing of 200, 400 and 1000 sheets, the respective bubble removing controls are performed. It is found that most bubbles (98% to 99%) in the common liquid chamber can be removed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a method for eliminating clogging in the ink jet recording device will be described. When the ink jet recording device is not used for a long time, moisture is evaporated from the ink supplied to the recording head to increase the ink viscosity. As a result, ink clogging is caused in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and ink is adhered to the nozzle surface so as to affect the ink droplet discharge direction, resulting in deterioration of the printing performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> To eliminate this phenomenon (hereinafter, referred to as clogging), the relation between the ink viscosity and the ink temperature is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> How ink viscosity is changed due to evaporation (a decrease in moisture) and temperature will be described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> After mixing the above compositional gradients, the composition is obtained by filtering with a 1-&mgr;m-membrane filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in any of the inks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as the ink temperature is increased, the ink viscosity is found to be lowered. Under normal printing conditions, the ink temperature is about 35&deg; C. to 50&deg; C. The ink viscosity is a value of about 1.25 to 2.0 mPa&middot;sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the ink jet recording device (recording head) left so as not to perform printing for a long time, ink is evaporated from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to gradually increase the ink viscosity in the common liquid chamber of the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> A water-based ink has an ink composition has water, a humectant, a coloring agent (dye or pigment) and other additives. Most of it contains water (about 60 to 80%) and a humectant (about 10 to 20%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a graph showing the relation between the ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> evaporation and viscosity. When the ink evaporation is advanced so that about 80% of the ink is evaporated, the ink viscosity at 23&deg; C. is increased three times or more, from 2.3 mPa&middot;sec to 7.6 mPa&middot;sec. Most of the ink evaporation includes water evaporation. This means that moisture in the ink is evaporated to some extent and further evaporation is inhibited. The ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is saturated when the evaporation is about 80%. It is found that further evaporation will not be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The ink in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the recording head is thickened to 7.6 mPa&middot;sec. Application of the printing pulse signal to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> cannot discharge the ink from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forcefully discharges the thickened ink by suction maintenance for recovery in the related art manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the relation between the ink temperature and the viscosity of the ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thickened after 80% evaporation. From this result, when the temperature of the ink thickened by evaporation is raised to about the ink normal boiling point (100&deg; C.), the viscosity can be lowered to a very low value of 2.1 mPa&middot;sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows the relation between the evaporation and the ink boiling point (boiling temperature). As shown here, the ink boiling point is found to be increased according to the evaporation. It is found that when the temperature of the thickened ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a 80% evaporation is raised to about the boiling point at normal (0 to 20% evaporation), the ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not boiled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> This embodiment eliminates ink clogging based on the above findings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Specific clogging eliminating control will be described with reference to the flowcharts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> When the ink jet recording device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is turned on, the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> detects a printing stop period from the previous printing by a timer, not shown (step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> judges whether the detected printing stop period is longer than the set period or not (step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). As described above, when the printing stop period is long, the ink evaporation from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is advanced to thicken the ink in the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) causing clogging. Comparing to the set stop period, a clogging state (ink viscosity) is judged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> When the printing stop period is shorter than the set period, whether or not the cleaning command is inputted from the user to the control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is detected (step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> With the user command, the later-described clogging eliminating control is performed aside from the above judgment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> When the printing stop period is longer than the set period (YES in step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) or the cleaning command is inputted (YES in step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>), the later-described clogging eliminating control is performed (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> After terminating the clogging eliminating control, the printing stop period of the timer is reset to repeat the above control until the power is turned off (steps <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The clogging eliminating control will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The same steps as the bubble removing control of the first embodiment are indicated by similar reference numerals, and the detailed description thereof is omitted. Only different points will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The point in which the short pulse signal is applied to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to heat ink in the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the individual channels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is the same as the bubble removing control except that ink is heated until the head temperature is the normal boiling temperature T5. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when the ink temperature is heated to about 100&deg; C., the ink viscosity is reduced to about &frac13; so that the ink can be discharged outside. On the other hand, when the ink is boiled, the ink meniscus position is moved to the common liquid chamber side of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that ink discharge cannot be done quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the ink boiling point (boiling temperature) depends on the ink evaporation. When the ink evaporation is increased, the ink boiling point is also increased. When the ink temperature is heated to about 100&deg; C., ink whose ink evaporation causing clogging is equal to or above 50% will not be boiled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The control part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> detects that the head temperature exceeds T5 &deg; C. based on the detection signal from the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The printing pulse signal is outputted to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to perform a dummy jet N6 times (for example, 3000 times) (step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). This is because, immediately after stopping the heating operation, the ink temperature is high and the ink viscosity is low so that ink discharge can be done smoothly. Unlike the bubble removing control, since the ink is not boiled, the ink meniscus position is on the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> side of the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Ink droplets can be discharged quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Like the bubble removing control, wiping is performed to terminate the control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The operation of such clogging eliminating control will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, with respect to the thickened ink causing clogging, the short driving pulse signal is inputted to the heating elements <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for ink discharge. Without increasing the waste ink, the ink in the individual channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be heated. In addition, no ink droplets are discharged in order to heat the ink. The dummy jet can prevent the nozzle surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from being stained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The head temperature of the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is applied to the normal boiling temperature T5 &deg; C. by the above heating to perform the dummy jet. The ink whose viscosity is lowered can be preferably discharged from the ink discharge opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The thickened ink is heated only to the normal boiling temperature T5 &deg; C. The thickened ink is not boiled and immediately after reaching the normal boiling temperature, the dummy jet can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The clogging eliminating control has eliminated clogging using a mechanism in the recording head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Head suction maintenance for eliminating the head clogging is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Such an operation is confirmed by test. Table 2 shows the relation between the temperature of the recording head and the recoverability. The evaluated recording head is left for six months in an environment at a constant temperature of 24&deg; C. and a constant humidity of 50%. From the observation of the nozzle surface, meniscus of the ink discharge opening is solidified completely, and the viscosity is increased considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The recording head has a nozzle arrangement of 800 dpi and 512 nozzles in total. Under the ink discharge driving conditions, a driving frequency is 20 kHz, a driving voltage is 32V, a driving current is 100 mA, and the pulse width of a driving pulse is 2.5 &mgr;sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Under the evaluation conditions, a driving energy of the short pulse signal (1.0 &mgr;sec) not discharging ink is applied. After a required head temperature is reached, the normal printing driving pulse signal is applied to perform ink discharge 3000 times. Whether all the nozzles are recovered or not is judged for recoverability. The evaluated ink has the composition of the ink <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> From this result, when the head temperature is raised to about 100&deg; C. as the ink boiling point, the viscosity of the thickened ink is lowered so that the ink can be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the recording head is heated by the short pulse signal. The recording head can also be heated by the dummy jet. When the head temperature is increased only by the dummy jet, discharge of about several ten thousands of jets is necessary. The waste ink is increased so that the dummy jet receiving periphery is stained over a wide range. It can be considered preferable that the temperature of the recording head is raised by the short pulse signal not discharging ink, and then the thickened ink is discharged outside by a small number of dummy jets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording device and the bubble removing method according to the present invention can reliably remove a bubble or clogging by a simplified construction to inhibit image quality deficiency. In addition, only ink discharge permits bubble removal and clogging elimination. A negative-pressure suction device is unnecessary and the waste ink amount can be reduced largely. The ink jet recording device which is at low cost and has high reliability can be provided. </paragraph>
