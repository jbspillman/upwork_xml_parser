<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Stents and other prosthetic devices have provided the means to clinically treat many conditions. Stents are commonly used to open blood vessels, e.g. clearing obstructions, preventing restenosis, providing support at the site of an aneurysm, and to repair damage to vascular tissues, e.g. arteries and veins. In addition to blood vessels, other vessels of the body may be repaired with a stent, including the trachea for breathing disorders, renal and urethral tubules, fallopian tubes for the treatment of infertility, eustachian tubes for the treatment of chronic ear infection and other hearing disorders, large and small intestines where the vessels may be occluded with tumor cells, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many stent designs are known and in clinical use. For example, they can be cut from a tube or formed from a wire that has been bent back and forth in a zig-zag pattern and wound in a circumferential direction to form one or more loops of a pre-determined circumference. Typically, the stent is radially expandable from a collapsed condition. Once in position, it is expanded to the predetermined size, to support and reinforce the lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the largest fields for the use of stents is in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Treatment by balloon angioplasty, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), has been shown to improve life expectancy after occlusion of blood vessels, but up to 40% of patients encounter restenosis within 6 months. Since angioplasty alone is marked by progressive luminal compromise (negative remodeling), stenting has become the leading interventional strategy with current application in 60-70% of PTAs. Stent use offers a number of advantages over simple PTA, including decreased early in-hospital complications, increase in luminal diameter, decreased negative remodeling, and sealing of intimal flaps. However, arteries treated with stents also encounter dramatically accelerated rates of in-stent restenosis, which are clinically significant in up to 40% of cases. Smooth muscle proliferation and vascular remodeling; restenosis after stent deployment is due almost entirely to smooth muscle hyperplasia and matrix proliferation. In-stent neointima formation thus remains a major procedural limitation for stent use, limiting both utilization and long-term clinical benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There has been interest in the development of a drug delivery platform that can provide local delivery of pharmaceuticals, for example, the delivery of anti-restenotic drugs; anti-proliferative agents for the treatment of tumors; antibiotics in the treatment of chronic ear infection, and the like. While systemic administration of drugs or other biologically-active substances is satisfactory for some medical treatments, many other treatments can be facilitated and/or improved with local drug delivery or administration to selected portions of internal body tissues. Localized drug administration is particularly advantageous where drug retention in the treated locus is required for an effective period of time without appreciably affecting other body tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The development of stents for drug delivery is of great interest for the treatment of a variety of conditions. The present invention addresses this problem. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Compositions and methods are provided for a stent based drug delivery system. The stent comprises a matrix, where the matrix has entrapped a pharmaceutical agent of interest. The matrix, for example microspheres, etc. resides within a channel formed on one or both of the abluminal or adluminal surfaces of the stent, and allows for release, usually sustained release, of the entrapped agent. The stent and matrix is encased with a gel covalently bound to the stent surface and optionally also covalently bound to the matrix, which prevents loss of the matrix during transport and implantation of the stent, and which affects the release of the biologically active agent, through degradation and diffusion characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The delivery system of the invention finds use in the delivery of pharmaceutical agents, particularly where a localized concentration of the agent is desirable. In one embodiment, the stent is a cardiovascular stent, where the pharmacologic agent is an anti-restenotic agent, e.g. to prevent in-stent restenosis. In another embodiment, the stent is a gastrointestinal stent that prevents obstruction due to tumor ingrowth or reactive hyperplasia, and which also delivers a chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of hyperplasia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The delivery system of the invention also find use in the evaluation of candidate agents by providing both efficient delivery and low perturbation at the site of implantation. The efficiency of drug delivery provided by the drug delivery stent allows a sensitive comparison of the effect of an agent on, for example, restenosis, hyperplasia, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the matrix is formed into microspheres or other discrete particles that entrap the agent to be delivered. The matrix may be biodegradable, bioerodible, or biocompatible, non-biodegradable compositions. In all cases the matrix will provide for release of the entrapped agent over time. The matrix is loaded into the channels, and then ensheathed in a gel bound to the stent surface, e.g. by derivatization of a metal oxide surface with methoxysilane, by binding to a plastic surface, binding to a biodegradable or bioerodible stent surface, and the like. The pharmaceutical agent is not directly bound to the stent surface.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Compositions and methods are provided for a stent based drug delivery system. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, a biological agent of interest is entrapped within a matrix <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The matrix is loaded into channels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the surface of a stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which channels are formed on one or both of the stent abluminal or adluminal surfaces. The matrix allows for release usually sustained release, of the entrapped agent. The stent and matrix is sheathed with a covalently bound gel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which may help retain the matrix during transport and implantation of the stent. The stent surface may be derivatized <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to improve covalent binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the stent is used to deliver therapeutic agents to a patient, providing the advantage of efficient delivery and sustained release of an agent at a localized site.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term stent is used as is known in the art, to refer to a prosthesis which can be inserted and held, when desired, in a lumen of a vessel or organ in the body. Uses include the support of blood vessels, the trachea, renal and urethral tubules, fallopian tubes, eustachian, large and small intestines, etc. Materials commonly used in stent construction include biologically compatible metals, e.g. stainless steel, titanium, tantalum, gold, platinum, copper and the like, as well as alloys of these metals; low shape memory plastic; a shape-memory plastic or alloy, such as nitinol; and the like. Any of these materials can be fabricated to form channels for use in the present invention, and can form, or be derivatized to form, covalent bonds with the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Non-limiting examples of commercially available stents include the Gianturco-Roubin stent and the Palmaz-Schatz stent, commonly used for tandem short segment stenotic lesions; Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass.), a self expanding stainless stent used for long lesions; Mammotherm stent, Symphony stent, Smart stent, all of self expanding nitinol; the balloon exapandable Perflex, AVE, Intrastent, and Herculink stents, self-expanding Instent, Gianturco Z-stent (Wilson-Cook, Winston-Salem, N.C.), Ultraflex nitinol mesh stent (Microinvasive, Natick, Mass.), and Esophacoil (IntraTherapeutics, Eden Prairie, Minn.). Tracheobronchial stents include the Gianturco Z tracheobronchial tree stent and the Wallstent tracheobronchial endoprosthesis. The stent may be self-expanding, or may be expandable with a balloon, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Additional platforms for the invention include polymeric biodegradable stents, anastomotic devices, and scaffolds, including synthetic biodegradable or bioerodible porous scaffolds produced using solid free-form fabrication techniques which include selective laser sintering, three-dimensional printing, fused deposition manufacturing, and stereolithography for micro- or nano-fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises channels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the surface, which may be on either or both of the abluminal (toward the wall) or adluminal (toward the lumen) surfaces. The channels may extend to the end of the stent, forming an open channel, or may be a closed channel. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the channels are on the adluminal surface and direct delivery to the cells of the vessel wall. Within the channels is a matrix <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which is covalently bound to the stent surface, which may be derivatized <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for that purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the channel will be dictated by the requirements for the specific use, and will be sufficient to contain the unit size of the matrix, e.g. microspheres of 1 to 100 &mgr;m diameter, and will not be of a depth so great that it compromises the integrity of the stent&apos;s structural integrity. The depth will usually be at least about 10 &mgr;m, more usually at least about 20 &mgr;m, usually not more than about 200 &mgr;m, more usually not more than about 100 &mgr;m, and preferably are about 45 to 65 &mgr;m in depth. The depth is usually greater than about 10% of the total depth of the stent structure, usually greater than about 50% of the total depth of the stent structure, usually not more than about 80% of the total depth of the stent structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The length and width of the channel may vary greatly depending on the tissue intended for deployment, for example a cardiovascular stent may have smaller dimensions than an enteral stent. The length of the channel may be up to and including the length of the stent, or where the stent has a strut pattern, along the entire circumference, or a fraction thereof. The width of the channel will be sufficient to contain the unit size of the matrix and still maintain the structural integrity of the stent. For example, the channels are usually at least about 10 &mgr;m in width, more usually at least about 20 &mgr;m in width, preferably at least about 45 &mgr;m in width, where the upper boundary of width is determined by the specific stent design, but is generally not more than about 50 to 75% of the total width of the element, i.e. strut, tube, etc., but could be up to 100% of the width in the case of tapered channels, such as one can get from laser machining the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Channels may be tapered in cross-section, such that the width at the stent surface is wider than the width at the bottom of the channel, e.g. a V shape, a U shape, a V shape with a flat bottom, etc. Where the channel is tapered, at the stent surface, the tapered channel is usually more than about 10% of the strut width, usually more than about 50 or more than about 75% of the surface width, and may be as much as 100% of the surface width. Depth for tapered channels are as described above for a non-tapered channel. The degree of taper will determine the width of the channel at the bottom, where a V-shaped taper will result in a width of about 0 to about 10% of the width of the stent structure. A broader bottom may also find use, where the width of the channel at the bottom will be from about 10% to about 50% of the width of the stent. Channel dimensions and architecture are designed to achieve the desired percent coverage and delivery location while preserving mechanical integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Channels may be fabricated into a stent using known micro- or non-fabrication techniques known in the art, including electro-discharge machining (EDM), laser machining e.g. photolithography, thin-film deposition, wet chemical etching, reactive ion etching, inductively coupled plasma deep silicon etching, laser ablation, air abrasion techniques, injection molding, embossing, and other techniques. Stents may also be comprised of polymeric materials, e.g., plastics, biodegradable polymers, and the like. Such substrates are readily manufactured from microfabricated masters, using well known molding techniques, such as injection molding, embossing or stamping, or by polymerizing the polymeric precursor material within the mold. These polymeric materials may include treated surfaces, e.g., derivatized or coated surfaces, to enhance their utility in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Covalent Attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The gel is covalently bound to the channel surface. The stent surface may be derivatized for covalent binding of a highly viscous agent or component of a gel-forming composition, which can be applied in the absence or presence of channels described above. Where the surface is a metal, it may be first modified with an adhesion agent. The use of silane coupling reagents, especially those of the formula R&prime;Si(OR)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in which R&prime; is typically an aliphatic group with a terminal amine and R is a lower alkyl or chloro group, to attach a macromolecule or polymer covalently to a solid support is well known in the art. Alkoxy or chloro leaving groups are particularly reactive towards hydroxyl groups found on metal oxide surfaces, where trichlorosilanes are much more reactive than trialkoxysilanes, and appear to form the densest films. Other organosilanes include 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane; aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES); 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (MPS); glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane (GOPS), and the like. In the case of APTES, succinnic anhydride can be used to change the amino functionality to carboxylic acid which is then attached to an amino-linked nucleic acid via carbodiimide coupling. MPS can be used to form disulfide linkages with thiol-containing biomolecules. GOPS has been used in schemes using long polyether chains to provide greater distance and flexibility between the surface and the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Bifunctional trichlorosilanes have been made so that other molecules can be later attached to the silanized surface. For example, 1-thioacetato-16-(trichlorosilyl)-hexadecane and related analogs have been described as a linking agent for biomolecules. The active silane monomer can also be diluted with a monomer which does not contain the linking group, to effectively &ldquo;space-out&rdquo; the active silane monomers that deposit on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The degree of surface coverage depends on several variables such as reaction time, temperature, degree of hydration of the substrates, nature of the solvent, the cleaning procedure utilized prior to silanization of substrates and the nature/morphology of the oxide layer on the substrate. Methyl terminated diluent silanes provide a hydrophobic alternative to polar materials. Other diluents can be used to provide other functionalities to the surface, for example, the diluent may contain alcohol groups to increase hydrophilicity. The number of carbons in the diluent may also be varied to control the steric environment around the active silane&apos;s functional moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Polymer coating of plastic surfaces may be achieved with polyvinyl alcohol, polyethyleneimine, polyacrolein, polyacrylic acid, etc. Direct chemical modification of plastic surfaces includes graft polymerization; halomethylation; plasma deposition of amines, alcohols, and carboxylic acids; nitration followed by reduction; and oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The linkage may utilize a homo- or heterobifunctional linker having a group at one end capable of forming a stable linkage to the stent surface, and a group at the opposite end capable of forming a stable linkage to the matrix. Illustrative entities include: azidobenzoyl hydrazide, N-&lsqb;4-(p-azidosalicylamino)butyl&rsqb;-3&prime;-&lsqb;2&prime;-pyridyldithio&rsqb;propionamide), bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate, dimethyladipimidate, disuccinimidyltartrate, N-&ggr;-maleimidobutyryloxysuccinimide ester, N-hydroxy sulfosuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate, N-succinimidyl &lsqb;4-azidophenyl&rsqb;-1,3&prime;-dithiopropionate, N-succinimidyl &lsqb;4-iodoacetyl&rsqb;aminobenzoate, glutaraldehyde, NHS-PEG-MAL; succinimidyl 4-&lsqb;N-maleimidomethyl&rsqb;cyclohexane-1-carboxylate; 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDP) or 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SMCC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A biodegradable, bioerodible or biocompatible non-biodegradable matrix comprising a biologically active agent is placed within the channels of the stent surface. The matrix may be of any geometry including fibers, sheets, films, microspheres, circular discs, plaques and the like. The size and form of the matrix can be used to control the rate of released period of treatment, and drug concentration. In some situations mixtures of matrices may be utilized employing the same or different biologically active agents. In this way, in a single administration a course of drug treatment may be achieved, where the pattern of release may be greatly varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the matrix is formed to discrete particles, e.g. fibers, spheres, etc., preferably microspheres. Microspheres are usually at least about 5 &mgr;m in diameter, more usually at least about 10 &mgr;m in diameter, and are usually not more than about 100 &mgr;m in diameter, more usually not more than about 50 &mgr;m in diameter. Certain drug/microsphere preparations necessitate smaller sizes, e.g. from about 5 &mgr;m to about 20&mgr;m in diameter due to concentration, molecular charge and volume requirements. In addition, smaller sizes are desirable to ease manual loading or automate loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Biodegradable polymers are generally subject to enzymatic or hydrolytic instability. Water soluble polymers may be cross-linked with hydrolytic or biodegradable unstable cross-links to provide useful water insoluble polymers. The degree of stability can be varied widely, depending upon the choice of monomer, whether a homopolymer or copolymer is employed, employing mixtures of polymers, where the polymers may be employed as varying layers or mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Some examples of biodegradable polymers useful in the present invention include: hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactic glycolic acid; polysaccharides such as cellulose or cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose, cross-linked or uncross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose starch, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthallate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthallate and calcium alginate, polypropylene, polybutyrates, polycarbonate, acrylate polymers such as polymethacrylates, polyanhydrides, polyvalerates, polycaprolactones such as poly-.epsilon.- caprolactone, polydimethylsiloxane, polyamides, polyvinylpyrollidone, polyvinylalcohol phthallate, waxes such as paraffin wax and white beeswax, natural oils, shellac, zein, or a mixture thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Of particular interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Included among the polyesters of interest are polymers of D-lactic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. By employing the L-lactate, a slowly eroding polymer is achieved, while erosion is substantially enhanced with the lactate racemate. The matrix may include small amounts of a compound capable of covalently bonding to the stent surface, e.g. including a PEG-dimethacrylate conjugate, or other linkers as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Polysaccharides useful as a matrix include calcium alginate, and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters characterized by being water insoluble, molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, etc. Other polymers of interest include polyvinyl alcohol, esters and ethers, which are biocompatible and may be biodegradable or soluble. For the most part, characteristics of the polymers will include biocompatibility, compatibility with the agent of interest, ease of encapsulation, a half-life in the physiological environment of at least 6 hrs; preferably greater than one day, water insoluble, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Biocompatible, non-biodegradable polymeric compositions are also used as a matrix. Where a non-biodegradable polymer is employed, the rate of release of the drug will be primarily solution/diffusion controlled. The rate of diffusion of drug through the non-biodegradable polymer may be affected by drug solubility, polymer hydrophilicity, extent of polymer cross-linking, expansion of the polymer upon water absorption so as to make the polymer more permeable to the drug, and the like. Diffusion of the drug from the implant may also be controlled by the structure of the implant. The non-biodegradable polymeric compositions employed may be varied according to the compatibility of the polymer with the drug or other active agent to be employed, ease of manufacture, the desired rate of release of the drug, desired density or porosity, and the like. Various non-biodegradable polymers which may be employed are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,303,637; 4,304,765; 4,190,642; 4,186,184; 4,057,619; 4,052,505; 4,281,654; 4,959,217; 4,014,335; 4,668,506; 4,144,317. The non-biodegradable polymers may be homopolymers, copolymers, straight, branched-chain, or cross-linked derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Biocompatible, non-biodegradable polymers of particular interest include polycarbamates or polyureas, particularly polyurethanes, polymers which may be cross-linked to produce non-biodegradable polymers such as cross-linked poly(vinyl acetate) and the like. Also of particular interest are ethylene-vinyl ester copolymers having ail ester content of 4 to 80% such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, ethylene-vinyl hexanoate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl propionate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl butyrate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl pentantoate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl trimethyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl diethyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl 3-methyl butanoate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl 3-3-dimethyl butanoate copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl benzoate copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additional naturally occurring or synthetic non-biodegradable polymeric materials include poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), plasticized poly(vinylchloride), plasticized poly(amides), plasticized nylon, plasticized soft nylon, plasticized poly(ethylene terephthalate), natural rubber, silicone, poly(isoprene), poly(isobutylene), poly(butadiene), poly(ethylene), poly(tetrafluoroethylene), poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(acrylonitrile, cross-linked poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(trifluorochloroethylene), chlorinated poly(ethylene), poly(4,4&prime;-isopropylidene diphenylene carbonate), vinylidene chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinyl chloride-diethyl fumarate copolymer, silicone, silicone rubbers (especially the medical grade), poly(dimethylsiloxanes), ethylene-propylene rubber, silicone-carbonate copolymers, vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer, vinyl chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinylidene chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, poly(olefins), poly(vinyl-olefins), poly(styrene), poly(halo-olefins), poly(vinyls), poly(acrylate), poly(methacrylate), poly(oxides), poly(esters), poly(amides), and poly(carbonates). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Various techniques known in the art may be employed to entrap the anti-restenotic agent in the matrix. Useful techniques include solvent evaporation methods, phase separation methods, double emulsions methods, UV crosslinking, chemical crosslinking, self-assembling systems based upon covalent or noncovalent interactions, interfacial methods, extrusion methods, molding methods, injection molding methods, heat press methods and the like. The ratio of agent to polymer will vary with the desired rate of release, the amount of agent generally varying in the range of 1 to 80 weight percent of the polymer in addition to other agents present. The ratio of drug to polymer may be adjusted to produce optimized compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Where the matrix is in the form of microcapsules or microparticles, a preformed rate controlling polymer may be dissolved in a volatile substantially water-immiscible solvent, and the agent then added to the polymer-solvent solution. Depending upon the nature of the agent, one may have the agent dispersed in the viscous polymer-solvent mixture or a solid dispersion of drug particles, where the drug will have been pulverized to obtain a fine powder. The matrix may also be formed by mixing the agent with molten polymer at the appropriate temperature, for example for molten polylactic polymer, between 60&deg; to 90&deg; C. The resulting mixture can be cut, molded, injection molded or extruded into any shape or size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In an alternative method, a coating can be formed around the layered solution to provide an encapsulated matrix for controlled, prolonged release of the active agent. To form the coating, an appropriate aqueous solution, generally water, is slowly poured over the surface. In this manner, polymerization results in a membrane surrounding the drug or agent. Alternatively, the drug and polymer mixture may be extruded to provide, for example, a long rod or fiber. The dispersion or solution can alternatively be added to a rapidly stirred aqueous solution comprising water and a dispersion agent, which may be a protective colloid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Where desired, the matrix may be formed by one of the methods described above, but in the absence of the active agent. The drug-free matrix may then be loaded with drug by, for example, immersing the matrix in a solution comprising the active agent for a time sufficient for absorption of the drug. Where the activity of the drug will not be compromised, the drug-filled matrix may then be dried or partially dried for storage until use. This method may find particular application where the activity of the drug of choice is sensitive to exposure to solvents, heat or other aspects of the conventional solvent-evaporation, molding, extrusion or other methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The gel is selected to be a polymeric compound that will fill the spaces between the matrix and the channel, that can be covalently bound to the stent surface and optionally covalently bound to the matrix, and that provides a porous protective barrier between the matrix and the environment, for example during storage, implantation, flow conditions, etc. The gel may contribute to the control of drug release through its characteristics of degradation and diffusion. In additional, the gel may comprise a biologically active agent that is the same or different from the biologically active agent present in the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Suitable polymers for the gel include poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), plasticized poly(vinylchloride), plasticized poly(amides), plasticized nylon, plasticized soft nylon, plasticized poly(ethylene terephthalate), natural rubber, silicone, poly(isoprene), poly(isobutylene), poly(butadiene), poly(ethylene), poly(tetrafluoroethylene), poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(acrylonitrile, cross-linked poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(trifluorochloroethylene), chlorinated poly(ethylene), poly(4,4&prime;-isopropylidene diphenylene carbonate), vinylidene chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinyl chloride-diethyl fumarate copolymer, silicone, silicone rubbers (especially the medical grade), poly(dimethylsiloxanes), ethylene-propylene rubber, silicone-carbonate copolymers, vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer, vinyl chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinylidene chloride-acrylonitrile copolymer, poly(olefins), poly(vinyl-olefins), poly(styrene), poly(halo-olefins), poly(vinyls), poly(acrylate), poly(methacrylate), poly(oxides), poly(esters), poly(amides), poly(carbonates), etc., which may be conjugated or combined with other polymers, e.g. PEG, etc. The gel is cross-linked to the stent through the chemistry described above. The polymer may be molded, wrapped, etc. around the stent to provide a protective covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Biologically Active Agent. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Compounds of interest include chemotherapeutic agents for neoplastic tissues, anti-inflammatory agents for ischemic or inflamed tissues, hormones or hormone antagonists for endocrine tissues, ion channel modifiers for cardiovascular or other tissues, and neuroactive agents for the central nervous system. Exemplary of pharmaceutical agents suitable for this invention are those described in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Goodman and Gilman, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y., (1993) under the sections: Drugs Acting at Synaptic and Neuroeffector Junctional Sites; Drugs Acting on the Central Nervous System; Autacoids: Drug Therapy of Inflammation; Water, Salts and Ions; Drugs Affecting Renal Function and Electrolyte Metabolism; Cardiovascular Drugs; Drugs Affecting Gastrointestinal Function; Drugs Affecting Uterine Motility; Chemotherapy of Parasitic Infections; Chemotherapy of Microbial Diseases; Chemotherapy of Neoplastic Diseases; Drugs Used for Immunosuppression; Drugs Acting on Blood-Forming organs; Hormones and Hormone Antagonists; Vitamins, Dermatology; and Toxicology, all incorporated herein by reference. Agents may be in the form of simple drugs, peptides, peptide fragments, DNA, RNA, ribozymes or engineered hybrids of nucleic acids and peptides or peptide fragments, or derivatives of each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention can be exploited as a platform for delivery of genetic materials and thus is useful in a variety of applications. Nucleic acids that correct genetic deficiencies can be introduced into a targeted tissue, e.g. blood vessels, intestines, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Specific agents of interest include therapeutic agents that inhibit in-stent restenosis. Such agents may include rapamycin; antiplatelet agents; GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, e.g. RheoPro; DNA; ribozymes; RNA; antiplatelet drugs, e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole; anticoagulant drugs, including heparin, coumadin, protamine, and hirudin; antimitotics (cytotoxic agents) that work directly to prevent cell mitosis (replication) and antimetabolites that prevent replication, e.g. methotrexate, colchicine, azathioprine, vincristine, vinblastine, fluorouracil, adriamycin, mutamycin, etc. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, e.g. dexamethasone, betamethasone, etc. can also be useful to locally suppress inflammation caused by injury to luminal tissue during angioplasty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are used for antihypertensive and renoprotective actions. ACE inhibitor include, but are not limited to, captopril, benazepril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, quinapril, Ramipril, imidapril, perindopril, erbumine, and trandolapril. ACE receptor blockers may also be used in place of or as well as ACE inhibitors, and these include losartan, irbesartan, candesartan, cilexetil, and valsartan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Nicotine receptor agonist, e.g. nicotine (S-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine) and other compounds that substantially specifically bind a nicotine receptor and provide a pharmacological effect. &ldquo;Nicotine receptor agonists&rdquo; encompass naturally-occurring compounds (including, but not limited to, small molecules, polypeptides, peptides, etc., particularly naturally-occurring plant alkaloids, and the like), endogenous ligands (e.g., purified from a natural source, recombinantly produced, or synthetic, and further including derivatives and variants of such endogenous ligands), and synthetically produced compounds (e.g., small molecules, peptides, etc.) The term &ldquo;nicotine&rdquo; further includes any pharmacologically acceptable derivative or metabolite of nicotine which exhibits pharmacotherapeutic properties similar to nicotine. Such derivatives, metabolites, and derivatives of metabolites are known in the art, and include, but are not necessarily limited to, cotinine, norcotinine, nornicotine, nicotine N-oxide, cotinine N-oxide, 3-hydroxycotinine and 5-hydroxycotinine or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Agents that increase nitric oxide are of interest as anti-restonic agents, e.g. S-nitrosopenicillamine, sodium nitroprusside, N-ethyl-2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino)ethanamine (NOC 12), etc. The production of nitric oxide may also be modulated by cytokines, such as &ggr;-interferon, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-2 and endotoxin due to their effect on the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. The inducible form of NO synthase is increased by cytokines and the constitutive form seems to be decreased by cytokines. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been found to upregulate endothelial cell NOS activity, as described by U.S. Pat. No. 6,147,109, Liao et al. Any of the forms of nitric oxide synthase can be utilized, as the protein or an active fragment derived therefrom, or as a DNA construct for expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Also of interest for the inhibition of restenosis are compounds with an anti-angiogenic effect. These include the anti-angiogenic polypeptides: angiostatin (O&apos;Reilly et al (1994) Cell 79:315-328); endostatin (O&apos;Reilly et al. (1997) Cell 88: 277-285); and anti-angiogenic anti-thrombin III (Bock et al. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10 (24), 8113-8125); and the like, and further include functionally active variants and derivatives thereof. Other anti-angiogenic agents include inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases, e.g. amifostine, WR-1065; marimastat, primomastat, alpha-1 antitrypsin; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, compounds that block thrombin, and other anti-coagulants, may be used to inhibit restenosis, such compounds based on the tripeptide motif D-Phe-Pro-Arg; e.g. LY287045, etc. Many compounds, such as inogatran and melagatran, are known in the art. For non-limiting examples, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,326,386; 6,232,315; 6,201,006; 6,174,855; 6,060,451; and 5,985,833; among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Agonists of the TGF-beta receptor are also of interest. TGF-&bgr; receptor Type I and type II mediate most activities of TGF-beta (Ebner et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>260:1344-1348; and Franzen et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>75: 681-692). Ligands include TGF-&bgr;, and mimetics and biologically active derivatives thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For the induction of apoptosis, agents of interest include death domain receptor ligands, which are compounds, usually polypeptide compounds, that bind to mammalian cell surface receptors comprising a death domain, or homologs or orthologs thereof, and that, by binding so deliver a signal for apoptosis to the cell. The intracellular protein interactions triggered by these receptors can be attributed to binding interactions of the death domain, which is homologous to an approximately 80 amino acid domain near the C-terminus of TNF-R1, and is responsible for signaling cytotoxicity (Huang et al. (1996) Nature 384:372-5). The TNF receptor death domain family includes TNF-R1, Fas (CD95), TRAMP (wsl/Apo-3/DR-3), TRAIL-R1 (DR-4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR-5, TRICK2, KILLER). Death domain ligands include proteins that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation by binding to specific death domain receptors. These ligands include the TNF family, e.g. TNF, lymphotoxin, CD30 ligand, 4-1 BB ligand, CD40 ligand, CD27 ligand, and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and homologs and analogs thereof. The functional, soluble forms of TNF as well as human FasL exists as trimers. Lymphotoxin &bgr;, a member of the TNF family, consists of a heterotrimer of one (lymphotoxin-&agr;, or TNF-&bgr;) and two &bgr; chains (lymphotoxin-&bgr;) on the membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Anti-restenotic polypeptides and peptides can be administered in their native form, or through the administration of nucleic acids encoding the molecule of interest. Administration of nucleic acids results in genetic alteration of targeted cells. The nucleic acid materials for delivery to targeted tissue encodes a gene product for which expression is desired, and a promoter for expression of the gene product. By &ldquo;nucleic acid of interest&rdquo; is meant any DNA, RNA, ribozyme, hybrid or analog thereof that encodes a polypeptide or other gene product that is desirable for expression in tissue of a subject. The gene product can include a polypeptide, an anti-sense mRNA, or other gene product that is desirably expressed. The term &ldquo;DNA of interest&rdquo; or &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; is used herein as shorthand to refer to the nucleic acid of interest and is not meant to be limiting. The nucleic acid delivered to the tissue in vivo can take any number of forms. For example, the nucleic acid can be introduced as a linear or circular molecule, preferably a circular molecule (e.g., a circular plasmid or other construct). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid of interest and the promoter are operably linked to provide a construct, or vector for expression. Normally, &ldquo;construct&rdquo; will refer to a nucleic acid molecule that facilitates expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleic acid to be introduced. By &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; is meant that a DNA sequence and a regulatory sequence(s) (e.g., a promoter sequence) are connected in such a way as to permit transcription when the appropriate molecules (e.g., transcriptional activator proteins) are bound to the regulatory sequence(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The amount of DNA to accomplish expression of an anti-restenotic gene product at an effective level will vary according to the desired effect, as well as with other variables such as the age of the subject, the tissue to be genetically altered, the gene product to be expressed and the desired level of its expression, etc. In general, the amount of DNA administered is an amount sufficient to provide for transformation of a number of cells that in turn provides for a level of gene product expression from the introduced DNA to provide for a desired effect. Dosages are routinely determined in the art, and can be extrapolated from the amounts of DNA effective in an animal mode (e.g., a rodent (mouse or rat) or other mammalian animal model), in which factors such as the efficiency of transformation and the levels of gene product expression achieved can be readily assessed and extrapolated to other vertebrate subjects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid of interest can be obtained from any of a variety of sources or methods well known in the art, e.g. isolated from suitable cells, produced using synthetic techniques, etc., and the constructs prepared using recombinant techniques well known in the art. Likewise, techniques for obtaining expression of DNA or RNA sequences in a genetically altered host cell are known in the art (see, for example, Kormal et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:2150-2154, 1987; Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; each of which are hereby incorporated by reference with respect to methods and compositions for eukaryotic expression of a DNA of interest). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Expression of the introduced nucleic acid can be short-term, i.e. a few hours to several hours to a few days, or permanent or long-term i.e. from a week to several weeks to a few months or more. In general, gene product expression from the introduced nucleic acid ranges from at least about 1 to 2 days, or 3 to 5 days, to about 1 week, generally about 1 to 4 weeks, up to about 6 weeks, and may be as long as about 10 to 12 weeks or longer. Where expression times of more than a few weeks are desired, for example from about 10 to 12 weeks or longer, expression of the gene product can be maintained by using a retroviral construct having inactivated LTRs and an internal promoter in the construct to drive gene product expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Complex systems of drugs may be carried by the prosthesis. An anticoagulant or antiplatelet may be included in the outermost surface of the device in order to elute off very quickly for the first several days. Antiinflammatories and antireplicates can be formulated into the device to continue to elute later, when in contact with non-blood cells after neointima overgrowth has surrounded the device. The drug elution rate does not need to be uniform, and may be tailored to fit the need of the patient. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Therapeutic Uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The drug delivery system of the present invention is useful for any vascular surgery, such as may be used in any situation in which the flow of blood through a vessel has been compromised. There are a variety of conditions where there is restricted blood flow through that vessel. Occlusive vascular conditions of interest include atherosclerosis, graft coronary vascular disease after transplantation, vein graft stenosis, peri-anastomatic prosthetic graft stenosis, restenosis after angioplasty, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease or other forms of occlusive arterial disease, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In a complex biological process such as restenosis, a therapeutic strategy may involve multiple therapeutic factors, e.g. released with multiple time courses. Strategies may utilize combinations of microspheres and gels containing different agents and/or that are formulated for different release profiles. Due to their versatility, the controlled release materials can be adapted and combined to provide the desired time course and dose-response for each stent and application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Other uses include conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Malignant obstruction of the stomach, esophagus, or duodenum causes nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, electrolyte imbalance, poor nutrition, and severe dehydration. Causes include primary tumors of the stomach and duodenum, malignant infiltration by neoplasms from adjacent organs (e.g., pancreas), and compression by malignant regional lymphadenopathy. Expandable stents offer a nonsurgical alternative for treatment. These are particularly useful in poor surgical candidates with malignant obstruction of the gastric outlet. The ability to treat duodenal obstruction secondary to extrinsic compression from pancreatic cancer further expands the spectrum of indications of stent placement for primary nonsurgical palliation. Stents have also been used in patients with benign gastroduodenal strictures when conventional surgical resection or bypass was not possible or wanted. In patients with benign disease, coexistent morbid factors involving the cardiopulmonary systems may limit surgical options, which makes the use of metallic stents more attractive. In all cases, the ability to provide therapeutic agents in addition to the stent provides enhanced benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Other vessels of the body may be repaired with a stent, including the trachea for breathing disorders, renal and urethral tubules, fallopian tubes for the treatment of infertility, eustachian tubes for the treatment of chronic ear infection and other hearing disorders, etc. Biologically active agents of interest include those described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Drug Evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The drug delivery platform of the present invention finds use in the evaluation of drug candidates, for example to test efficacy in preventing in-stent restenosis. A test sample comprising a candidate drug is entrapped within a matrix, and used in the drug delivery platform as described above. The stent is then implanted in a biologically relevant model, e.g. an animal model of injury after balloon angioplasty, and the effect on the condition of interest evaluated after a period of time sufficient to observe an effect. The results may be compared to various controls, including stents lacking pharmacologic agents; stents comprising an agent with known efficacy; combinations of matrix polymers, combinations of gel polymers, variations in stent design, and the like. The results can be entered into a data processor for reference, and algorithms used for the comparison and analysis of results obtained under different conditions. Mathematical systems can be used to provide quantitative measures of similarities and differences between results. For example, the translation profiles in the database can be analyzed by pattern recognition algorithms or clustering methods, e.g. hierarchical or k-means clustering, etc., that use statistical analysis to quantify relatedness. These methods can be modified by weighting, employing classification strategies, etc. to optimize the ability of a translation profile to discriminate different functional effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A plurality of assays may be run in parallel with different agent concentrations to obtain a differential response to the various concentrations. As known in the art, determining the effective concentration of an agent typically uses a range of concentrations resulting from 1:10, or other log scale, dilutions. The concentrations may be further refined with a second series of dilutions, if necessary. Typically, one of these concentrations serves as a negative control, i.e. at zero concentration or below the level of detection of the agent or at or below the concentration of agent that does not give a detectable change in the phenotype. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Stent Design and Loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The stent design for this initial example is based on the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. The stainless steel stent is 1.6 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length and has 10 longitudinal struts evenly spaced circumferentially, and it is designed to be balloon expandable up to 5 mm diameter. Its basic slotted tube design was modified by electro-discharge machining (EDM) channels 80 microns wide by 60 microns deep along the length of the abluminal (toward the wall) side of each strut. The stent is designed to provide abluminal (toward the wall) but not adluminal (toward the lumen) delivery. With these dimensions, the channels cover 8.5% of the lumen wall area when deployed to a nominal diameter of 3 mm. The channels were machined from end to end in order to allow drug delivery both to the wall and to the tissue surrounding the stent end which both represent critical sights for neointima formation. Microspheres, which can hold and release therapeutic agents (for example, see Yuksel et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>Plast Reconstr Surg. </italic></highlight>105(5):1721-9; Waugh et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Circ Res. </italic></highlight>84(1):84-92 were mechanically loaded into these channels. Excess microspheres were removed with a needle and short bursts of air from a compressed air canister. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The corresponding design and post-manufacture stent appear as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C. No mechanical failures occurred during the deployment of over 60 stents of this design. Stent channels were filled by manual loading with PLGA (75:25)-PEG-buffer microspheres with a mean diameter of 50 &mgr;m. Predetermination of microsphere size can be difficult for certain drug-loads, and smaller microspheres are more readily loaded. As a result, quantitative evaluation of stent filling as percent of total channel was subsequently evaluated for both large and small microspheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Microsphere Preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Bioerodible polyethylene glycol-polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA, Polysciences, Warrington, Pa.) microspheres (MS) were prepared as a modification of previously described techniques (Yuksel, et al, supra.) A mixture of 8:1::PLGA (75:25):PEG-8000 (polyethylene glycol, MW 8000, Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) was employed with the double emulsion technique to generate microspheres (MS) of final diameter 50 or 10 &mgr;m. Additionally, a pH buffer of 7.4 was incorporated in all MS preparations as a modification of other techniques to limit local pH changes (Zhu et al (2000) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>18:52-7. Separately, MS containing PEG-dimethacrylate instead of PEG were also prepared to a final size of 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In Vitro Flow Retention and Channel Fill Density Determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> To evaluate whether flow over the surface of the loaded stents resulted in dislodging of MS, stents were advanced into in vitro flow. Loaded MS-stents were mounted on a 4.0 mm x 2.0 cm noncompliant balloon. Two 25-30 cm segments of Tygon tubing were joined with a 5 cm segment of shrink tubing. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was introduced and adjusted to a flow rate of 250 ml/min. The stent was introduced from the downstream end of the tubing and advanced to the center of the shrink-tubing segment and maintained for a total of 2.0 minutes. The stent was withdrawn and employed for fill density analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To determine the mean percent of each channel that was filled with MS, the entire length of each channel was photographed with single composite photographs of each generated and employed in ImagePro Image analysis suite. Stents were examined on a Nikon E600 microscope with plan apochromat lenses at a total magnification of 40X. High resolution digital images were acquired using a Diagnostic Instruments true color SPOT camera. The entire length of each channel was photographed with single composite photographs of each generated and employed in ImagePro image analysis suite to determine the mean percent of total channel filled with MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Stents were manually loaded with microspheres of mean diameter 50 &mgr;m (b-MS) or 10 &mgr;m (s-MS), loaded onto a balloon, and the entire length of each stent channel was photographed. Mean channel fill density was calculated as the percent of total channel filled with microspheres. Stents were subsequently introduced into a flow loop in vitro in a transparent segment of tubing. The entire length of each stent channel was again photographed and analyzed. Results of both analyses are summarized as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. No statistically significant decrease in b-MS loading occurred after introduction to flow (P&equals;0.3351), while s-MS encountered significant loss of microspheres in flow conditions (P&equals;0.0001). However, certain drug/microsphere preparations necessitate smaller sizes due to concentration, molecular charge and volume requirements. In addition, smaller sizes are desirable to ease manual loading or automate loading. Given that some drug loads may necessitate small final MS sizes and small MS offer some technical advantages for stent-loading, strategies for hybrid systems to increase s-MS retention were subsequently investigated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Hybrid Strategies for Retention In Vitro and In Vivo-Gel Preparation and Stent Loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Stents were either rinsed with saline or pretreated with 2% 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (meac) in 75% ethanol and heat cured for 60 minutes at 105&deg; C. (silane-stents employed where described). The s-MS (either meac-MS or MS) were loaded as before and loaded stents were ensheathed in silicone tubing. One set of stents was loaded with 30% pluronic F-127 at a temperature of 4&deg; C. For other groups, a 20% mixture of 3:2::PEG-dimethacrylate:PEG with 900 ppm photoinitiator (HMPP) was introduced to fill unoccupied spaces within the channels. Ensheathed stents were exposed to UV-A overnight. Silicone tubing was withdrawn. Stents were loaded on 4.0 mm&times;2.0 cm noncompliant balloons and lyophilized overnight prior to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> To evaluate whether in vivo advancement and deployment altered MS density, adult male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.8-4.2 kg underwent general anesthesia induced with ketamine/medetomidine and maintained with isoflurane. An arteriotomy was performed and a 5F introduction sheath was placed. Under fluoroscopic guidance using a Siemans Angiostar, aseptically prepared stents were deployed in the infra-renal abdominal aorta. Pre- and post-deployment digital subtraction angiograms were recorded for each. Stents were post-dilated with a 5 mm angioplasty balloon (Jupiter, Cordis, Miami, Fla.) to a final lumen size of 125% of baseline with care taken to ensure that no branches were present within 5mm of either end or within the stent segment. Post-deployment angiograms were also recorded for each. Animals employed for channel fill density analysis underwent total-body perfusion-fixation under anesthesia with immediate excision of the aortic segment containing the stent. Stents were photographed for channel fill density as above both through the aortic wall and after excision from the aortic segment. Animals undergoing plaque evaluation and inflammatory infiltrate analyses were recovered and maintained for 7 days prior to total-body perfusion fixation as previously described. Treated segments were harvested, stents carefully excised and segments post-fixed in neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 12-14 hrs. Specimens were paraffin embedded and employed for plaque analysis or evaluation of local inflammatory infiltrate as described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Stents containing s-MS were again prepared as above and ensheathed en toto in silicone tubing. The spaces around the MS within each channel were filled with a rapid-release gel formulation in an attempt to prevent loss of s-MS under flow conditions. The entire length of each stent channel was again photographed and mean channel fill density calculated. These stents (MS/plu) were subsequently introduced into an in vitro flow loop, and channel fill density was calculated after flow exposure. Finally, MS/plu stents were introduced into the rabbit common femoral artery, advanced and deployed in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The aortic segments were subsequently excised and mean channel fill density after in vivo deployment was calculated both through the nearly transparent aortic wall (results not depicted) and after stent removal. Stent removal did not result in significant change in fill density. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, gel loading results in minimal loss of fill density, but exposure to flow again results in substantial loss of s-MS from the stent (P&equals;0.0001). In vivo deployment encounters still worse retention rates (P&equals;0.0201). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> New stents were pretreated to form a metal oxide-methoxysilane-monomethacrylate link to the metal-oxide layer of the stent surface. Silane stents were then loaded with either s-MS containing PEG-dimethacrylate or s-MS with PEG as above. Stents were ensheathed and a 20% mixture of 3:2::PEG-dimethacrylate:PEG was introduced to fill unoccupied spaces within the channels. Gels were subsequently polymerized to form gel-stent links (MS-gel) or gel-stent-microsphere links (MS-meac-gel). Stent channel fill density was again evaluated after balloon loading, after in vitro flow loop exposure and after in vivo deployment in rabbit aortas. Significant improvements in s-MS retention occurred for MS-gel in vivo relative to MS-plu (P&equals;0.0001) and in vitro under flow conditions (P&equals;0.0001 vs. MS-plu, P&equals;0.0001 vs. s-MS). Most importantly, no significant loss occurred when MS-gel groups were subjected to flow conditions (P&equals;0.3336) or in vivo deployment (P&equals;0.4244). While MS-meac-gel had statistically significant improvements in MS retention in vitro and in vivo relative to MS-plu (P&equals;0.0010, P&equals;0.0001 respectively) and s-MS (P&equals;0.0001 in vitro), these meac-s-MS particles were far less efficiently loaded than with s-MS without methacrylate. Additionally, MS-meac-gel exhibited significant loss of MS after in vivo deployment (P&equals;0.0004) while MS-gel did not. Thus, MS-gel exhibited the best performance under all conditions. Additionally, no mechanical failures (fractures, perforations, etc.) or complications occurred in any group, including MS-gel. As depicted in the representative digital subtraction angiogram of MS-gel stent (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), immediately post-deployment (panel a) there is distal spasm but no luminal compromise, perforation, or failure. By the time of harvest, the lumen remains patent, the stent intact, and no complications are present, as depicted in panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In summary, a solution for hybrid MS-retention is a gel that protects the microspheres from embolization during advancement and deployment. A crosslinked PEG-methacrylate gel was subsequently investigated. Initial experiments revealed that channel contents separated from the stent readily but did not fragment from one another. The stent channels were subsequently modified to add a methacrylate link to the metal-oxide layer of the stent in order to enhance channel retention of the polymers. Small microspheres were either prepared as before or modified to contain PEG-methacrylate. Gel polymerization thus anchored the gel to the channel and, in the latter group, to the surface of the microspheres themselves. Retention rates for this gel system were virtually complete under flow and after in vivo deployment. Thus, a stent system potentially allowing controlled drug delivery without embolization of polymers was developed. Given the progressive loss of methacrylate MS when exposed to flow and in vivo deployment and the relative ease of loading s-MS without methacrylate, subsequent experiments incorporated s-MS without methacrylate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> To evaluate whether the stent platform altered local inflammatory infiltrate, paired sections from the 7 day timepoint above were employed for granulocyte determination using chloroacetate esterase staining or for macrophage evaluation using immunohistochemistry (RAM-11, DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif.) as previously described by Waugh, et al. (2000). <highlight><italic>Circulation </italic></highlight>102:332-337. Number of granulocytes and macrophages was determined for each cross section, with mean and standard error tabulated by group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Since certain polymer systems have been shown to lead to local inflammation, cross-sectional macrophage and neutrophil infiltrate were examined for each group. Results are detailed in Table 1. No statistically significant differences in local macrophage or neutrophil infiltration occurred in MS-gel vs. Palmaz-Schatz stents (P-S) (P&gt;0.05 for each comparison).

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Plaque Evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> To evaluate whether the stent platform itself worsened plaque formation and whether the system could detect any therapeutic effect, animals (n&equals;5 per group) underwent stent implantation with normal (unchanneled) commercially available Palmaz-Schatz stents of identical dimensions, channel stents containing s-MS/PEG gel as prepared above (without any therapeutic factor), or channel stents loaded with s-MS/PEG gel containing a nitric oxide donor as an antineointimal agent. The NO-nucleophile complex in this study, N-Ethyl-2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino) ethanamine (NOC-12, Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.), releases two equivalents of NO per NOC-12. Animals were recovered and maintained on 0.25% cholesterol chow. On day 7, treated segments were excised and processed as described and cross sections employed for Verhoff elastica-Masson trichrome double staining as previously described (Waugh et al., supra.) Photographs of each aorta were acquired as before. Ratio of intima to media for each cross section was determined from the appropriate area measurements, with mean and standard error tabulated for each group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The impact of MS-gel stents on in-stent restenosis was subsequently evaluated, along with the suitability of this system to evaluate anti-restenotic agents. Briefly, animals underwent implantation of normal P-S stents, MS-gel stents containing polymer only (MS-gel), or MS-gel stents containing a therapeutic level of a nitric oxide donor as an anti-restenotic agent (MS-gel-NO). Early plaque formation was evaluated after 7 days through intima to media ratios to evaluate whether stent design or therapeutic factor altered early in-stent restenosis in a critical window. The results are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As indicated, MS-gel stents did not encounter significantly altered rates of early in-stent restenosis relative to P-S controls (P&equals;0.1126). In contrast, MS-gel-NO stents reveal a significant reduction in early plaque reduction relative to both controls (P&equals;0.0001 vs. P-S, and P&equals;0.000vs. MS-gel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Given that polymer systems prepared differently than those employed here have encountered high rates of inflammation and may adversely impact plaque formation, in vivo deployment of this stent system was evaluated relative to deployment of commercially available Palmaz-Schatz stents. The polymer-loaded stents encountered comparable rates of local macrophage and neutrophilic granulocyte infiltration after seven days relative to Palmaz-Schatz stents as detailed above. Perhaps more importantly, no statistically significant alteration in rates of in-stent plaque formation was evident relative to conventional stents of comparable dimensions. Thus, these polymer-loaded stents do not appreciably worsen the system which they were designed to evaluate and treat. These results are in sharp contrast to recent reports of polymer-only systems which require cytotoxic agents to avert increases in inflammation and plaque progression relative to conventional stents (Tamai et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>Circulation </italic></highlight>102:399-404; van der Giessen et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Circulation </italic></highlight>94:1690-1697; Colombo and Karvouni (2000) <highlight><italic>Circulation </italic></highlight>102(4):371). Given the technical, mechanical and biologic disadvantages of alternative local release strategies, no prior evaluation of potential anti-restenotic local agents has been effectively undertaken. The present platform thus represents an important and necessary step in the development of effective strategies for in-stent restenosis and management of cardiovascular disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> We subsequently evaluated whether the present system was sensitive enough to detect therapeutic levels of an anti-restenotic agent of any nature. Here, in vivo deployment of this system with one such agent, a nitric oxide donor, resulted in substantial declines in plaque formation relative to both polymer-loaded stent controls and conventional Palmaz-Schatz stents alone. Thus, this system has proven to be a relatively nonperturbing, effective, and sensitive method for evaluation and therapeutic delivery of putative anti-restenotic agents. Previously, identification of drugs locally effective in preventing in-stent restenosis has proven difficult, due to lack of a simple controlled release platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> With the present platform, selection and optimization of agents to locally prevent in-stent restenosis can now be readily accomplished. Although demonstrated here in a variation of a Palmaz-Schatz stent for simplicity, the present strategy can be translated to virtually any stent design type. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The strategies for local drug delivery described above are applied to other mechanical stent designs and can be accomplished with other machining techniques. For example, using laser machining techniques similar to those currently employed to manufacture modern stents, channels were cut into the abluminal surface of a BX-Velocity stent (Cordis Corporation, Miami, Fla.). The channels shown are approximately 75 microns in width and 60 microns deep and follow the strut pattern faithfully around the entire stent circumference. Channeled BX-Velocity stents have been treated successfully with the s-MS/PEG gel preparation. </paragraph>

Additionally, a pH buffer of 7.4 was incorporated to limit local pH changes in order to stabilize incorporated drugs and render the microspheres more biocompatible. During the microsphere manufacturing process, 2.0 mg of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.) in 200 ml phosphate buffered saline was added to the polymer solution. Control microspheres (blank microspheres) containing polymer and buffer without any drug were also prepared. Stents were prepared as above. </paragraph>

Under fluoroscopic guidance, aseptically prepared channeled stents filled with blank or angiostatin microspheres were deployed in the infra-renal abdominal aorta. Stents were post-dilated at 8 atm with a 5 mm angioplasty balloon (Jupiter, Cordis, Miami, Fla.) to a final lumen size of 125% above the baseline with care taken to ensure that angiostatin branches were present within the stent segment.

For the 28 day specimen analysis (n&equals;3 animals per group), each plastic-embedded aorta with stents was cut into five pieces longitudinally equal lengths. These pieces were stained by modified Verhoff elastic staining. Five cross sectional images of the stained aorta were obtained (n&equals;15 sections per group) from one side of plastic pieces. High resolution digital images of histological cross sections were acquired at 100X magnification from a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT true-color camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Mich.) as displayed on a Nikon E600 with Plan Apochromat Lenses (Nikon). Using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md.), the cross-sectional area of the intima and the media were determined by blinded observers. The ratio of intima area to media area subsequently tabulated for each, with the results presented as Table 2. Mean, standard error, and significance were determined.

PPACK irreversibly inhibits thrombin by alkylating the active center histidine residue. Since thrombin and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-induced DNA synthesis are potently inhibited by PD98059 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.), an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, this inhibitor or others of its class can be used alone or in combination to inhibit thrombin-mediated plaque progression after stenting. PD98059 is examined in the range from 100 nmol/l to 500 &mgr;mol/L daily release (optimal typically in the range of 10 &mgr;mol/L).

The stent is then removed from the cylinder and washed repeatedly to remove glycerol and unreacted chain blocker. The stent is then immersed in a sterile highly viscous solution containing PEG (MW 8000), PEG dimethacrylate (MW1200), and star-polymer PEG multi-methacrylates together with rapamycin at an effective dose for post-stenting restenosis. The stent is placed within an outer tube which allows a gap of 30 microns between the stent and the inner wall of the cylinder (although other thicknesses are valid as well). The gel is then polymerized under UV-A for 30 minutes to anchor rapamycin passively to the outer surface of the stent and the shoulders of the stent.
