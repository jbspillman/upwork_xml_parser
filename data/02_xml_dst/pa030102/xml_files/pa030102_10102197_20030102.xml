<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the field of catering apparatuses, and in particular to an improved chafing dish which employs handles on the food pan to assist in the exchange of hot chafing dishes, holding of serving utensils and drying of chafing dishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Chafing dishes, also referred to as food pans, steam tables and buffet pans (collectively referred to herein as chafing dishes), are widely used for buffet-type food service, serving various kinds of hot and cold foods. Such chafing dishes typically include a supporting water pan supported by a open frame bracing structure. A heat source may be placed below the water pan to heat the water in the pan. A chafing dish is supported by the water pan, typically above the level of the water. A lid is often provided to cover the chafing dish. Typically, both the deep water pan and the chafing dish will include an outwardly extending peripheral rim at an upper portion thereof. The peripheral rim of the water pan engages the open frame bracing structure to support the water pan. In a similar fashion, the peripheral rim of the chafing dish engages the peripheral rim of the water pan to support the chafing dish. Representative examples of this construction are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,045,672, 5,347,979 and 5,517,903. It is also possible with certain chafing dishes to utilize the chafing dishes and the open frame bracing structure without the intervening water pan, such as for food dishes served and maintained at room temperature. In this assembly, the chafing dish may be supported directly of the open frame bracing structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The chafing dishes must be removed from the assembly periodically for various reasons. For instance, chafing dishes must be removed and replaced to replenish the food in the chafing dish assembly, and must be removed to clean the chafing dishes. Chafing dishes must also be configured to provide a seal between the chafing dish and the water pan so that the steam or cold air below the chafing dish will not escape around the edges of the chafing dish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The prior art chafing dishes are typically constructed with a peripheral rim being either a planar flange having a down-turned outer edge or a planar ledge having an outwardly extending portion which rests on and provides a seal with the water pan in which the chafing dish is placed. Although such chafing dishes may provide an adequate seal so that food placed in the chafing dishes is maintained at a desirable temperature by the steam or cold air therebelow, it is difficult to remove such chafing dishes from the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To remove the chafing dishes, the edge of the chafing dish, which provides the seal with the water pan, must somehow be lifted from the water pan, by wedging a finger, utensil or other tool under the sealing rim. Such a procedure is difficult and can be dangerous since the chafing dish assembly may have a hot upper surface and/or hot escaping steam which can burn the hand or finger of the person removing the chafing dish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Commonly, persons removing the chafing dish may unwisely use something else, other than a pot holder, such as an apron that he or she is wearing to remove the chafing dish. This could result in the uneven handling of the chafing dish causing spills and/or burns to the food handler and/or patrons standing nearby while the transfer of hot food is taking place. Furthermore, aprons mistakenly being caught underneath of the chafing dish could quite possibly cause the whole chafing dish assembly to be pulled over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to address this problem in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,276 discloses a chafing dish with a notch in the sealing flange to provide a space between the chafing dish and the water pan into which serving utensils can be inserted to lift the chafing dish for easy grasping of the edge of the chafing dish. This solution still requires and encourages the inappropriate use of serving utensils and the like to pry the chafing dish upwards. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,112,948 and 3,179,287 disclose special attachable chafing dish handles, however, both of these designs require engaging the underside of the sealing flange of a chafing dish with the handles. Consequently, the attachment of the handles to the chafing dishes encounters the same problems associated with moving the chafing dishes without the handles. These handles would also interfere with the sealing of the chafing dish and the water pan and the placement of the lid if the handles were left attached to the chafing dish. Finally, these handles represent another tool which the operator must store separately while the chafing dish assembly is being used, washed or stored. Permanently attached handles have been used in other nested cookware such as draining baskets or strainers as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,588,614 and 4,106,486. The strainers have been designed with a peripheral supporting ledge for supporting the strainer within another cooking vessel, typically containing water or oil. Due to the perforated nature of a strainer, the ledge does not form a seal with the underlying cookware. Consequently, removing a strainer from the cookware does not result in a sudden escape of steam as in chafing dish removal. Furthermore, such strainers are not commonly used for food presentation and service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The conventional prior art chafing dishes are typically stored nested one inside of the other. Suction force makes it difficult to separate such nested chafing dishes. The nested chafing dishes are typically separated by wedging a finger, serving utensil or other tool between chafing dishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Such methods of removing chafing dishes from chafing dish assemblies or from one another as stated above are time-consuming, unprofessional in appearance and sometimes dangerous in the fast-paced, high-profile food service industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Serving utensils, used with chafing dishes while the chafing dishes are full of food, are usually placed serving-end-in the food being served, while the handle is rested on the end of the chafing dish. Frequently, serving utensils slide or fall into the food requiring food handlers to repeatedly wipe or replace serving utensils after placing fingers into hot food to retrieve the serving utensil. This also is dangerous, time consuming and does not lend itself to a professional appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a chafing dish which can easily be removed from a water pan or open frame bracing structure which provides a seal between the chafing dish and the water pan and allows a lid to be placed on top. There is a need for a chafing dish which provides non-suction storage, and provides a suitable place for serving utensils to rest while the chafing dish is in service. There is a need for a chafing dish which allows a safe, efficient and professional-appearing exchange and serving of food. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The chafing dish according to the present invention solves the difficulties inherent in prior art chafing dishes by providing a chafing dish which can easily be removed from a chafing dish assembly which provides a seal between the chafing dish and the water pan and allows a lid to be placed on top. The chafing dish of the present invention provides non-suction storage for the chafing dishes of the present invention and provides a suitable place for serving utensils to rest within the chafing dish while the chafing dish is in service. The chafing dish of the present invention allows a safe, efficient, and professional-appearing exchange and serving of food, keeping the servers hands away from the outer edge of the chafing dish where hot steam rises from the water pan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The chafing dishes according to one embodiment of the present invention may have a generally rectangular configuration which includes a solid bottom panel and four solid walls extending upwardly therefrom. The four walls may include first and second end walls and first and second side walls. The end walls are joined to the side walls at curved corners thereof, and define a generally rectangular top opening. A top sealing flange extends outwardly from the four walls around the entire periphery of the walls. The sealing flange has a continuous planar lower surface so that when the chafing dish is placed in a water pan, the continuous planar lower surface is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the water pan around the periphery of the water pan. Thus, the chafing dish is in sealing engagement with the water pan when the chafing dish is placed therein. At least one handle extends inwardly from an inner edge where the end wall or the side wall meets the top ledge. A pair of handles may be provided on opposed sides of the chafing dish for easy handling of the chafing dish. The handles are joined to the inner edge, such as by a screw and washer assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each handle includes an opening to receive the hands of the user to easily grip the chafing dish and remove the chafing dish from the water pan or the open frame bracing structure. The handles extend inwardly allowing a lid to be placed on top. The handles will space one chafing dish from a nested adjacent chafing dish to provide non-suction storage. The handles also provide a suitable place for serving utensils to rest while the chafing dish is in service. Handles are placed to the inside of the chafing dish to keep hands away from dangerous steam that rises from the water pan when removing the chafing dish from the water pan. Thus the handles on the chafing dishes of the present invention allow a safe, efficient and professional-appearing exchange and serving of food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description in which like reference numerals represent like elements throughout.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an overall view of a chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has first and second opposed ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively, and first and second opposed sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> respectively. Chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a generally rectangular planar bottom panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having the two sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the two ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending upward therefrom, and a continuous top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are joined to and merged with bottom panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at curved corners <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are joined to and merged with ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at curved corners <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> define a top opening and terminate in the top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends outwardly from sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> around the entire periphery thereof and has a continuous planar lower surface so that when chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed in a water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of a chafing dish assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will be in intimate, uninterrupted contact with upper surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, as schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Thus, chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be in sealing engagement with the water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> when it is located therein. The chafing dish assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will additionally include the open frame bracing structure <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the burners <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The top opening is generally rectangular in shape with the exception of the curved corners <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably has two handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> located at first and second opposing ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be connected to the top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with fasteners <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, such as &num;8-32 machine screws. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are positioned generally where ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and top ledge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> meet, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> End handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises left and right upstanding arms which are connected by a horizontal cross bar at curved corners. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates that the handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> extends preferably at about a thirty (30) degree inward angle as relative to the ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to accommodate a lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and has enough width (about 100 mm) between upstanding arms to fit four fingers comfortably. Handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> thus allows a firm grip to be had to lift chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The preferred thirty (30) degree angle of the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also allows chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to fit into the oven, moves the users hands away from the escaping steam as well as allowing lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be placed on top of chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Hands are placed on handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> above chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to lift the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> out from a water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> instead of on the side of the chafing dish as with use of prior art chafing dishes, keeping the hands clear of dangerous rising steam. The inward angle of the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also lends itself as a ledge, or resting place for a serving spoon <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> or serving tongs <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to rest securely, minimizing the need for wiping and/or replacing serving utensils as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This is opposed to resting on the ledge of the chafing dish, as in prior art use, where the serving utensil easily slides, handle and all, into the food being served. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> additionally facilitate the ability to acquire instant access to chafing dishes while being stored since the nesting problems found in the prior art do not exist. Prior art chafing dishes are frequently stacked, or nested, when they are hot and wet and tend to be difficult to separate when they cool. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provide storage in which nesting problems do not exist as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> would also allow for hanging storage of the chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and do not interfere with stacking of chafing dishes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Color-coded handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> could be used to aid in the identification of food in each chafing dish. Prior art chafing dishes offer no such identification. Thus while using color-coded handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, interpreting quickly what food is in which chafing dish and how long the food needs to be in the oven, minimizes the constant or prolonged time that the oven must be open to determine such criteria and minimizes the loss of heat from the oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> show another embodiment where the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are bent for aesthetic purposes and appeal. Handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be heat resistant so as to minimize the need for pot holders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention solves the difficulties inherent in prior art chafing dishes by providing a chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which can easily be removed from a water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of a chafing dish assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, keeping hands clear of hot rising steam and which provides a seal between the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and allowing a lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be placed on top. The permanent inward sloping handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides non-suction storage, and provides a suitable place for serving utensils to rest while the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in service. The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allows a safe, efficient and professional-appearing exchange and serving of food, keeping hands clear of dangerously hot rising steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be formed by drawing a flat rectangular sheet or blank of metal into the desired shape, utilizing, for example, a double-action press, drilling appropriate holes and screwing the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> onto the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be attached by other fasteners, such as bolts, or other methods, such as welding or molding the whole chafing dish to include handles as one continuous unit. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be easily retrofitted into existing chafing dishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In operation, one first selects the type of chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> needed. Size will vary by length or height of sides <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may take other forms than rectangular, such as square, oval or circular. Food to be served is placed in the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and placed into an oven to be cooked. When using the color-coded handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the cook may choose a system where the color of the handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> corresponds with a type of food allowing a quick glance to determine what food is in what chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby minimizing the length of time needed for the oven to be open thus minimizing the lost heat which reduces the temperature within the oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Once the food is cooked servers are ready to take the food to the chafing dish assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and place the chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the respective water pans <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The server may use pot holders to lift the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by holding each of the two handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and placing the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The server may place a lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> with handle <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> on top of the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or may place appropriate serving utensils into the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. For example, a server may rest the handle of serving spoon <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (as it provides a ledge) on handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or may place serving tongs <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> keeping the utensils accessible to patrons or servers, and minimizing accidental falls of the serving utensils into the food being served. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is empty of food or otherwise needs replaced, the server simply lifts the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the two handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and evenly removes it, although it may still be full of liquid. A second server may be close at hand to replace the empty chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a full chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be made of any suitable material such as metal or polycarbonate or polysulfone material. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be made of any suitable material, including a metal rod having an outer shell of heat resistant color-coded ceramic material. It is also contemplated that the handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> could be formed as foldable or collapsible to assist in storage or oven clearance. The handles may be on all or any collections of the sides of the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, even on opposed sides of a circular or oval chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The inward angle, height, width and decorative shape of the handle can also be changed as desired. For example the handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be as long as the length of a side of the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In summary, several advantages are achieved with the present invention. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provide an opening in which hands can firmly grip the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> safely and remove it from the chafing dish assembly. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provide a suitable place for serving utensils to rest while the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in service. Serving utensils such as a spoon or tongs rest nicely within the handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> itself or leaning against the handle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This presents a professional appearance and is more efficient requiring less time to be spent wiping or replacing messy serving utensils by food servers. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of this invention provide non-suction storage. While storing the chafing dishes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention by crisscrossing or nesting as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, easy access to a chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is achieved. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> allow a safe, efficient and professional-appearing exchange and serving of food, while the use of prior art food pans is dangerous, time-consuming, and unprofessional in appearance when exchanging and serving food in the highly visible and highly competitive food service industry. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> extend inwardly allowing a lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be placed on top, and keeping hands away from dangerous steam while lifting the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the chafing dish assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is one advantage that the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention reduces the stress in an already stressful occupation. The handles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> make preparing, exchanging and the overall handling of food safer, more efficient and more professional in appearance than any prior art chafing dishes known. Food servers need only someone to remove the empty chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while they replace it with the full chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of food. Even while using pot holders, a firm grip can be had easily, quickly, simply and safely. Prior art chafing dishes are difficult to separate and cumbersome to exchange food, especially hot food, requiring the use of an additional serving utensil, pot holders, strong arms and a steady hand in the midst of a crowd of hungry guests, to wedge a serving utensil with one hand, using a pot holder with the other hand, to try to get a firm grip on a tiny ledge or gripping device too close to hot steam to remove the chafing dish. A slip of the pot holder, a burn from the steam or an uneven position of food remaining in the chafing dish may cause the server to have any number of a sort of accidents. Consequently, the food server&apos;s stress level may be very high trying to cope with all of the uncertainties the prior art chafing dishes present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus the reader will see that the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides a highly reliable method of cooking, exchanging and serving of food in a safe, efficient, and professional-appearing manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention solves the difficulties inherent in prior art chafing dishes by providing a chafing dish which can easily be removed from a chafing dish assembly, and which provides a seal between the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the water pan <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, allowing a lid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be placed on top. The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides non-suction storage, and provides a suitable place for serving utensils to rest while the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in service. The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention requires no extended training time to use in a proper and safe manner, and requires no guesswork as to the best way to lift the chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the chafing dish assembly. The chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention allows a more balanced firm grip to be acquired before lifting a chafing dish <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that may be full of liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While my above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of embodiments thereof.
