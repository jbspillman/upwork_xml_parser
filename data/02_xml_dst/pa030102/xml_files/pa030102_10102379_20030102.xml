<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a spring centraliser device of the type for maintaining a tubular member spaced from the wall of a bore and to a method of making such a device. Such devices may also be used to space a tubular member within an existing tubular member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As known to those skilled in the art, centralisers are used in the oil, gas &amp; water well drilling industries to center a tubular member (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;tubular&rdquo;) within a borehole or inside a previously installed larger tubular member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such tubulars are generally constructed in handleable lengths e.g. 12 meters, each length being externally male threaded at both ends. The lengths are assembled together using short female threaded couplings. The assembly of the tubulars to a predetermined total length is referred to as a string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the string is disposed in a borehole or existing tubular, it is desirable to position the string substantially centrally within the borehole or existing tubular thereby forming a substantially annular passageway around the tubular of concern. This enables passage of material such as fluids, cement slurries in the space around the tubular. Under some circumstances substantial centrality is imperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To try to achieve this condition, centralisers are disposed at selected intervals along the length of the string. Retention of the centralisers in a desired position may be achieved in restricting axial movement by the use of a so-called &ldquo;stop collar&rdquo; being a ring grippingly secured to the tubular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The state of the art embraces solid and spring centralisers. Solid (or rigid) centralisers are commonly cast products of a fixed dimensional construction with an undersize external diameter to allow passage through the borehole. Spring centralisers are of a flexible external diameter aimed at making contact with the borehole wall at all times while being capable of flexing to accommodate obstructions or dimensional changes within the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Solid centralisers have an internal diameter with clearance to fit onto a tubular and an external diameter selected to pass into the borehole of concern. Given the axial variation of diameter of the borehole it is clear that solid centralisers cannot adequately support the tubular in a central position. Equally being solid, a solid centraliser risks jamming within the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Spring centralisers may overcome these problems. The current design is a number of hardened and tempered leaf springs, also referred to in the art as bows, located radially around and affixed to low carbon steel end bands at both ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However spring centralisers currently in use exhibit difficulties with under modern conditions such as depth of well, angular deviation profile and extended horizontal reach into the hydrocarbon producing strata. As a result they may be made with an oversize outer diameter to create a pre-load effect that gives an acceptable deflection versus load characteristic: however this may create undesirable insertion forces. This in turn, together with multi-part construction gives rise to the possibility of disintegration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Known methods of securing together of the parts of the conventional centraliser include welding and mechanical interlocking of the leaf springs to the end bands&mdash;both methods of construction detract from the maximum possible load/deflection performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The multiple parts used to construct conventional centralisers e.g. a split and hinged variety of a more common size variant consists of fourteen individual parts, each part being at risk of breaking off and falling into the well bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> There is thus a long felt want for a practical one-piece centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,285 (Solum) contains a disclosure of a one-piece centraliser consisting of two collars spaced by bows (staves) which are outwardly curved and serve to centralize a tubular member. The Patent further discloses a manufacturing technique for such a centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method consists of cutting a blank from a sheet of metal material by cutting or punching. The material is said to be a steel selected from a group including &ldquo;plain carbon steels with a relatively high carbon content or alloy steels with a medium carbon content&rdquo;. The Patent specifically envisages the use of &ldquo;grades of steel . . . which are unsatisfactory for construction of centralisers using conventional methods due to such factors as the need for welding the spring bows to the end collars&rdquo;. It is understood that such materials are spring, non-ductile, steels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method requires the blank to be placed on a forming die having a semi-cylindrical cavity, followed by application of a press tool to form the blank into a U-shape and in turn followed by the application of an inverse die to form a &ldquo;long cylinder&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The blank is then supported at one end and the other end urged towards the one end to provide outwardly-bowed staves as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally the abutting ends of the blank are welded together by arc-welding to create a generally cylindrical centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The centraliser is then heat-treated to obtain the desired hardness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Experiments have revealed a number of deficiencies in the technique described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,285. Indeed the disclosure of the U.S. patent is not believed to provide a practical method for manufacturing a centraliser. Further a device which is manufactured from material to which the method of the Patent can be applied is not believed to have the desired properties of a practical centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Firstly it is noted that the use of a cold-forming dual die system of the type disclosed in the Patent upon a spring steel would not result in a cylindrical blank. Rather, the ends of the blank which were brought into abutment by the die, would spring apart once the die were removed. It would, therefore, be necessary either to perform the forming step as a hot forming process or alternatively to physically restrain the blank in its cylindrical state. The latter technique would not permit the outward-bowing step as disclosed in the patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Forming the blank into a generally cylindrical body by the die technique disclosed has been found to give rise to curved end collar portions. However, the intermediate bow portions, which are separated by longitudinal apertures, do not confirm to the curved profile of the collar portions due to the presence of the apertures. The bow portions, therefore, tend to form flats, or curves of relatively unpredictable curvatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> During longitudinal bow-forming pressure, the bows neither form uniformly nor predictably. Furthermore, unless hot forming is used the tolerances in the bows are unacceptable. Moreover, as the material used is a spring steel, it is necessary to over-bend the bows and it is not possible to determine consistently how far to over bend the bows to give rise to a desired final form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the experiments performed, it has been found that a centraliser in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,285 requires the use of hot forming. This in turn means the use of expensive high temperature form tools with the resultant high tooling attrition. At least two and maybe three heating steps are required for forming followed by a heating/quenching phase to the required hardness. Then a further heating to temper stage of around 450 degrees centigrade is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Apart from the high cost of hot forming in this way, there is the risk of growth of grain within the crystalline structure of the material, which would give rise to weakness and the risk of breakage. Further, each of the heating steps is likely to give rise to distortion, which reduces the yield and increases the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is known that the form of the bows is desirably parabolic in the longitudinal direction. The technique disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,285 makes this form difficult to attain on a consistent basis. The arc-welding step requires pre-heating and a slow post-weld cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is therefore believed that the product and method of the U.S. patent is impractical. If conventional ductile formable materials were used, the method would be capable of putting into effect, but the resultant product would not have the properties required of a centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is understood that products in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,285 are not on the market. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the various Figures, like reference signs indicate like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> tubular disposed within a borehole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is formed from a plurality of lengths <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> connected together by couplings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As is well known, a centraliser <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is supported on each length <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by way of a respective stop collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Each centraliser <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is arranged to support the tubular, formed of the lengths <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, within the borehole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> such that the tubular is substantially centrally arranged. Each centraliser <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a pair of opposed end collar portions with six (three visible) outwardly bowed spring portions linking the collar portions. The spring portions are disposed substantially equidistant around the circumferences of the collar portions. The projection of the spring portions on the tubular are all substantially straight lines in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It will be seen that the upper, as seen in the drawing, centraliser has a stop collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> disposed between the two end collars, whereas the lower centraliser is disposed between two spaced stop collars <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the need for centralisation is found not only in the borehole but is also experienced within the internal diameter of a previously installed larger tubular assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a blank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has been formed from a single sheet of boron steel. The blank has a longitudinal axis Z-Z&prime; two transverse web portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> spaced apart by a number, here six, of spaced longitudinal web portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which extend substantially parallel (in this embodiment) to the axis Z-Z&prime;. The first and second transverse web portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are generally rectangular in shape, are mutually parallel and are disposed substantially perpendicular to the axis Z-Z&prime;. The six longitudinal web portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extend between the transverse web portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to define therebetween five apertures <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of equal size. The outer longitudinal web portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are inset from the ends of the transverse web portions by around half the width of the apertures <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to leave free end portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the transverse web portions. The free end portions are, in a first embodiment of a centraliser over-lappingly secured together so that each first end portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> overlaps its corresponding second end portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whereby the centraliser forms a generally cylindrical device. In other embodiments, the length of the free end portions is greater, and in these embodiments the free end portions are subsequently formed into connecting devices, as will later be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It will, of course, be understood that this is a purely exemplary blank and is used here to illustrate the method of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The blank is formed by cutting or punching from the sheet. A preferred technique is a high accuracy computer-controllable cutting method such as laser cutting or waterjet cutting. Such a technique can allow great flexibility, for instance enabling &lsquo;specials&rsquo; to be produced without a need for expensive dedicated tooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The blank is then cold-formed into a generally cylindrical shape. This may be accomplished by rolling or by other techniques known in themselves in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The relatively ductile nature of the boron steel material forming the blank allows for the blank to remain in its cylindrical state after the forming has taken place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The cylinder-forming stage preferably also forms the cross-sectional profile of the longitudinal web portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As will be later described, this cross-sectional form may be curved or, under certain circumstances, other shapes such as a flat shape may be preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to shape the cross-sectional form of the longitudinal web portions after forming the cylindrical intermediate product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Given the cylindrical intermediate product, the next step is to cold-form the longitudinal web portions to form the outwardly-curved bow portions (seen more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Again, given the relatively ductility of the material of the longitudinal web portions, it is possible to use an expanding mandrel or a similar device to achieve the desired form. The amount of &ldquo;spring&rdquo; is sufficiently small that desired profiles are easily obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is then welded along the free end portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to form a substantially continuous cylindrical member, albeit with the outwardly-curved bow portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and then a single heat stage is required followed by quenching to provide the desired finished hardness of the centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> If required, the device may then be stress-tempered. This tempering may be for the whole device, or localised heating of the bows may be instead performed. The heat required to temper boron steel is typically around 200&deg; C., less than half of the temperature required to temper spring steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It will be seen that it is possible to form the centraliser of the invention entirely without heat, with a subsequent single heating step providing the desired finished hardness and an optional stress tempering stage at a lower temperature than that required for spring steel. The result is that cold-forming tools are used, which allows for long tooling life. As there is no need to constantly heat and cool the centraliser, there is no risk of gain growth due to multiple heating and both stress and increase and heat distortion are avoidable. Suitable techniques are available to fine-tune the cross-section of the bows. Cold-forming allows the ready and consistent forming of the longitudinal shape of the bows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the properties of steel as delivered may vary from sheet-to-sheet. Given the fact that after forming and heat-treating the properties become more known in a preferred embodiment the centraliser device is cold-formed so that the bows are undersized. The amount of undersize may be determined by experiment, but typically a reduction in diameter of about 12 millimeters may be desirable. After a cold-forming step, the device is heat-treated to provide the desired hardness and, if necessary, temper. Then a further cold-forming step is performed to post-form the bows to the final desired configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It will be clear to those skilled in the art that this preferred method step ensures that the final product will be consistent. It will also be clear to those skilled in the art that cold-forming after heat-treatment further enhances the crystalline properties of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention the free-end portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed into snap-lock securing devices. This has not normally been practical with spring centralisers because the end band materials tend to be ductile and as a result have limited yield strength. In situations where spring steel is proposed, high temperature forming would be needed, with consequential tooling problems, if such a joint were attempted. The use of boron steel does, however, provide more than adequate stiffness in the end band/collar to allow for the snap lock connection to be effected and is achieved by cold-forming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of the invention, as will be later herein described, the free end portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are shaped to form hinge-type securing devices. The use of boron steel allows for turning over of the ends of the transverse webs with internal radii below twice the material thickness. By the use of boron steel, it is possible to sharply turn the material with a radius less than the material thickness. This should be contrasted with spring steels where radii above twice the material thickness are required, and in which hot forming is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It is noted that boron steel is well suited to welding; however, various of the embodiments described herein contain snap-fastenings or hinged joints so that welding can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> completed centraliser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown. This centraliser, as will be clear from consideration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, has six bows. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that a number of bows will be selected to the application and typically varies between three and eighteen. It is also envisaged that more than eighteen bows could be needed in certain applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an end view of the centraliser of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the section A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the curved form of the outer surface of the bow element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The particular shape of the bow element may be configured to obtain desired load-deflection characteristics. This is more fully discussed herein with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the preferred shape of the crosssection of the bow element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a curve. The particular shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sector of a circle, having radius r. By contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an alternative bow element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a flat cross-section, which is less preferred. A mathematical analysis to compare the stiffness of the sections can be performed, for example using the parallel axis theorem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Consider an exemplary flat section having width 1.5 units and thickness 0.158 units. This is similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and has a second moment of area about the neutral axis, In a given by equation 1: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>I<highlight><subscript>na</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.00054<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Consider now a section having the same width and thickness but having a curvature of 3.56 units. This is similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and has a second moment of area about the neutral axis, Ina given by equation <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>I<highlight><subscript>na</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.0006<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It is thus follows that in the above examples curvature of the cross-section shows some 20% increase in stiffness over the flat bar cross-section of similar proportions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The cold-forming techniques made possible by the use of boron steel as the material of the centraliser provide an ability to adjust cross-sectional curvature. In turn, this facilitates fine-tuning of the flexive force resistance. Moreover, transition regions from the selected cross-sectional curve of the bows to the end collar portions can be shaped to maximise stiffness of the flexing construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable in certain embodiments to form the bows to have a curvature greater than the curvature of a tubular to be inserted into the collar portions. In this case, each bow has an inner face which is shaped in the transverse direction such that a transversely middle region of the inner face is spaced from the longitudinal axis of the centraliser by a first amount, and the transverse edges of the bow are spaced from the longitudinal axis by a second amount, the first amount being greater than the second by more than the thickness of the material of the bow portions. This means that if the bow is compressed in use, the middle region is supported away from the tubular by the end portions abutting the tubular. The result is that the transition region where the bow merges with the collar is not permanently set by the compression, which would result in the centraliser becoming effectively useless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of a centraliser in accordance with the present invention. The centraliser <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is generally similar to that described with respect of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> although it has six bow elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, uniformly distributed about its circumference (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Additionally, however, they are formed at the lower end showed in the Figure of the centraliser, small &ldquo;tangs&rdquo; <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extending angularly outwards from the lower collar portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The tangs protrude into the annulus formed between the tubular being centralized and the borehole and have the effect of producing turbulence in fluid passing through the annulus. The tangs are integrally formed with the centraliser. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that tangs may be provided at both ends of the centraliser if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an embodiment of the centraliser blank is shown in which the longitudinal web portions are shaped to have a reduced width where they extend into the end collars <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A centraliser of this embodiment may be used where the highest load needs to be limited at maximum deflection. Conversely, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an embodiment is shown where the transverse width of the bow element is increased where it extends into the collar portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a configuration may be used where a higher load is acceptable at a maximum deflection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> graphical representation of deflection (d) versus load (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has a first full-line curve for the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Where a parabolic form of bow is provided, the dashed-line curve characteristic arises. A force perpendicular to the axis of the tubular applied to the leaf spring, would meet at the onset of deflection a parabolic form. The load is resisted to a greater degree by the parabolic form until the form is deformed to a curvature similar to that of a conventional radius. This is a preferred effect, which would be especially desired where a spring centraliser has been made to be a slide or push fit into the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The dotted curve conforms to a reduced end-width bow form, as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and the crossed curve relates to an increased end-width bow form as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in a further series of embodiments, the bow members are not separated by apertures but instead by narrow slots, the material forming the lands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the slots being retained. The lands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not curved at the time of forming the bow element <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. However, the lands are separated in the longitudinal direction by a transverse slot so as to provide land portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the upper collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and land portions extending upwardly from the lower collar portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The gap between the lands is selectable as best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> the gap between the upper and lower land portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is relatively small. Such an embodiment has advantages under certain circumstances. When a centraliser on a tubular is being run into a borehole, it is possible for the centraliser to catch or snag against, for instance, a protrusion of the borehole. Given that the centralisers are axially restrained by stop collars on the tubular&mdash;see <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&mdash;there is a chance that with the substantial weight of tubular involved, the centraliser may be axially compressed. In such a situation the bows can be distorted outwardly beyond the yield of the material and become permanently set in oversize condition. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> uses the spacing between the land portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to limit the reduction in centraliser free height to prevent such a condition arising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the spacing between the land portions is greater than that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and is sufficient to enable a stop collar to be positioned on the tubular and within the body of the centraliser. A further embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> has a substantial spacing between the land portions, and in this case where a stop collar is introduced within the body of the centraliser and increased axial movement between the centraliser and stop collar is allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, in a fourth embodiment of the centraliser <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the form of the bow elements <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (best seen with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) is generally flat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Continuing to refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, each bow element <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has a first substantially straight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the first collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and laterally away from the longitudinal axis, followed by a second portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is substantially axis parallel and a third straight line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which tapers back to extend into the lower collar at portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment has very rigid properties. Very high loads would be required to deflect the bows and, once the material yield point had been exceeded, there would be virtually no spring recovery. Such rigid centralisers would be made undersize to the borehole, typically six millimeters or more less than the borehole diameter. They might be employed where there was the expectation of high lateral loads of greater magnitude than the restoring force of the centraliser. A modification of the fourth embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> in which land material <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is retained and extends fully between the upper and lower collar portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This embodiment provides high longitudinal strength to resist height collapse if the centraliser should snag when running into the borehole. Yet a further modification is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> in which the land material is removed in a similar way to that described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> further embodiment of a centraliser in accordance with the invention is shown, in which the bow portions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the centraliser <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> describe a generally spiral path between the upper and lower collar portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a blank used for the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> may be used to bridge grooves in the borehole left after a drilling operation, scrape the borehole surface free of accumulated surface contaminants and present an angle of shear against the surface of the borehole when running in. A rigid version of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. In this embodiment the centraliser <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has generally spiral bow members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, somewhat similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, but with straight line segments similar to those described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> show preferred selected forms of the cross-section of the bow portions <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. In both cases the material of the bow portion is curved inwardly so to lie on the cylinder defined by the inner surfaces of the collar members <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the form of bow element is generally rectangular, whereas that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is generally semi-circular. The effect of both is that the bow portions will lie on an inserted tubular to provide enhanced resistance to collapse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, yet a further embodiment of a centraliser in accordance with the invention is shown. This centraliser <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has bow portions <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which have a longitudinally central region <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of constant width which extends at each end into a Y shaped bifurcation <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The bifurcations extend into the top collar member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or respectively bottom collar member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Each bifurcation defines an aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> forming an isosceles triangle in this particular embodiment. The aperture allows fluid passing through the annulus between the tubular and the borehole to also flow along the underside of the bow member. Hence centralisers having such apertures may be used where reduced flow resistance is needed. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the particular choice of a triangular aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is only exemplary and other shapes could be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the end elevation shows more clearly the provision of the apertures, which allow for reduced flow resistance. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that with increased reach of wells the flow resistance is desirably reduced. As flow resistance increases, pressure must be raised to deliver the same flow rate and the increased pressure may lead to break down of geological formations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The embodiments described so far have been unitary structures. It is, however, known to those skilled in the art that split form centralisers of two halves separated along an axial center line will be required. It will also be known to those skilled in the art that centralisers having more than two segments will be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference> show a first securing formation for securing together segments of a centraliser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> which is a partial end view of a centraliser, the end collar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed of two semicylindrical end collar portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B which are secured together by a snap-lock securing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, an example of the snap-lock devices shown. The end portion of one end collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is longitudinally cut to form three contiguous finger portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The central finger portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is raised out of the plane of the collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and has two windows <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> cut into it, the windows having a curved profile in their extremities nearest to the end of the collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. The two outer finger portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are arcuately cut to define two tongue portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which are displaced upwardly from the plane of the collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. The form of the tongue portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is arcuate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The other end collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is also cut to form three counterpart finger portions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In this case, the two outer fingers <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are raised out of the plane of the end collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B and are provided with windows <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> of similar shape to windows <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the central finger <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is provided with two upwardly-disposed tongue portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of similar shape to the tongue portions <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When the two collar portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B are urged together, the central tongue portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the first collar portion is able to ride over the upper surface of the central finger <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the second collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B while the outer finger portions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> ride over the outer fingers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. The disposition of the tongues <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the windows <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is such that the tongues enter the counterpart windows to form-lock the two collar portions together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Use of boron steel with the end collar portions being heat-treated to provide high stiffness collar portions enables the snap-lock securing device to readily and safely secure together the two halves of the device. An advantage of such a configuration is that for a two-half centraliser, only two components are required. This is in contrast to arrangements where hinge pins and other securing devices may be required. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the fewer components that are provided, the less risk there is of components becoming detached and falling into the borehole with high remedial costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment in which the free ends of the collar portions are turned to form a hinge, having an hinge pin <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, shows that the first end collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is cut to have three spaced finger portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and that the second end collar portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B is cut to have two spaced finger portions <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The disposition of the finger portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is such that a finger portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may be interdigitated between the finger portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The finger portions have a proximal region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which extends outwardly from the respective end collar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. A distal portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which lies against a face of the proximal portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and an intermediate hooked portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> whose inner face defines an aperture for the hinge pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In use the hinge is assembled by interdigitating the finger portions, the hinge pin is inserted, and the assembly offered up to the tubular. The opened assembly is then closed around the tubular, and a second hinge pin inserted into the second hinge. The ends of the hinge pins are deformed e.g. by peening over, to retained them in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</cross-reference>, a slip-on stop collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> consists of a generally cylindrical body of boron steel having circular top and bottom flange portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> extending outwardly and a number of boss portions <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> disposed around the circumference of a central region of the collar to accept grub screws <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Traditionally stop collars are manufactured from rolled rectangular bar section with the ends being butt-welded to form a ring. The material must be suitable for welding as the action of the screws against an inserted tubular can cause substantial circumferential loading at the weld joint. Other known products are made from seamless steel tube, but there are limitations as to available size and material grade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> By selecting boron steel, it is possible to achieve 98% of the mechanical properties of the parent material across a welded zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> clearly shows the end flanges, which are produced by swaging. The swaging is performed in the un-heat-treated state of the material and the boss portions <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are formed by known flow drilling techniques. After the device has been suitably formed, it is then heat-treated and quenched to obtain the desired properties. </paragraph>
