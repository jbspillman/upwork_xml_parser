<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally belongs to the field of space environment technology and relates to measurement of the volume of liquid or solid under microgravity. More particularly, the invention concerns volume measuring apparatus for volume measurement under microgravity applicable even in vacuum surroundings, e.g., on an orbit of an artificial satellite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The technology about the measurement of the volume of liquid with sound is already known, for example, as described in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. 08-327429 and No. 07-83730. The known devices described in these applications both are comprised of a container and a pipe communicating with an open space at one end. The measurement is carried out by a method of generating sound by a speaker or the like, collecting the Helmholtz resonant sound induced by spring action of the gas phase in the pipe and container, by a microphone, and calculating the volume of liquid from the resonance frequency of the Helmholtz resonant sound. There are also devices in which two containers are coupled to form a closed space and in which pressure fluctuations are detected to determine the volume of liquid, for example, as described in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. 06-201433 and No. 06-201434. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For measuring the volume of a liquid or the like in a container placed on an orbit of an artificial satellite, it is, however, first necessary to create a closed space, because the surroundings are a vacuum. The prior arts making use of the Helmholtz resonance had the critical defect that the devices were applicable only in the open space. The prior arts of measuring the volume of liquid or the like by detecting the pressure fluctuations were applicable to the use in the closed space, but had the problem that, because there occurred mixture of gas and liquid under microgravity, a device for controlling it was indispensable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The apparatus described above is a closed system and can be used under a special environment, e.g., on an orbit of an artificial satellite. </paragraph>

The same reference numerals as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> denote the same members as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the measurement procedure is also the same as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the third embodiment of the present invention, which is an apparatus adapted for the measurement making use of pressure fluctuations applicable in the closed space. Namely, the volume measurement of liquid under microgravity is substantiated by combination of the gas-liquid separating device with a method of detecting the amount of liquid from the ratio of fluctuating pressures in two containers, measured with high-precision pressure gages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the gas-liquid separating devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are disposed in the interiors of the containers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located above and below. The speakers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are provided as pressure fluctuation sources in the respective gas phases inside the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are connected to two amplifiers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. The amplifiers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected each via an attenuator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the signal generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a pressure signal analyzing unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The high-precision pressure gages <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are provided in the respective gas phases inside the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and detect pressure waves resulting from pressure fluctuations caused in the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in the container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the speaker <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then these pressure signals are passed through a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the pressure signal analyzing unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and then are amplified. The amplified pressure signals are fed into a signal analyzer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. After that, the volume of liquid is determined from the ratio of the pressure fluctuations of the two signals at the signal analyzer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Temperature signals from the thermometers <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are also fed into the signal analyzer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in order to take account of and make correction for influence from the ratio of specific heats in the two containers. A correction circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a device for controlling the output from the speakers so as to keep constant the amplitude of the pressure detected by either one pressure gage of the reference side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The pressure signal analyzing unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is composed of the signal generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, amplifiers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, attenuator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, band-pass filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, signal analyzer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and correction circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The containers can be replaced by the one of the type partitioned by the partition as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the case where a very-low temperature cryogen is confined in the containers, it is also possible to utilize the cold of the cryogen and apply high-precision pressure gages making use of superconducting sensors such as the SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the fourth embodiment as an application of the technology about the volume measurement of liquid shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to the measurement of the volume of solid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The pipe <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connects the interiors of the two containers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged laterally side by side and the two containers are integrally fixed by the supports <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Inside the containers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, there is provided a solid fixing device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for fixing the solid phase, e.g., ice <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This solid fixing device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> functions to fix the solid like ice to one end of the container and thus form a continuous space without solid so as not to interfere with the volume measurement based on the sound or pressure fluctuations; for example, the solid fixing device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be substantiated by fixing a member with continuous projections and depressions to the internal walls of the containers or by forming continuous projections and depressions in the internal walls of the containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The same reference symbols as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> denote the same members as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the measurement procedure is also the same as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An experiment was conducted with water in order to check the Helmholtz resonance in the closed system as described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an experimental setup used in the experiment, in which the volume of the container <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> loaded with a speaker for injecting sound waves is equal to the volume of the container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> presents the results of the experiment. It is apparent from this graph that the fundamental frequency of Helmholtz resonance and harmonics thereof were detected. The solid lines in the graph represent theoretical values calculated from Eq (6)with the correction factor of the neck tube length and it is clear that the experimental values substantially agree with the theoretical values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the experiment verified that the Helmholtz resonance also occurred in the closed containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention made it feasible to implement the volume measurement with sound in the closed space by the use of two or more containers and to implement the measurement of the volume of liquid or solid with sound under microgravity by the combination with the device for separating or fixing the gas phase, the liquid phase, or the solid phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is also feasible to realize practical utilization of the volume measurement under microgravity by provision of the device for separating or fixing the gas phase, the liquid phase, or the solid phase in the volume measurement making use of the pressure fluctuations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Since the apparatus is simple, it is feasible to implement the measurement on a maintenance-free basis, over a long period of time, and at low cost. For example, when compared with the invention described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-66175, the present invention eliminated the necessity for a plurality of vibration generators and detectors per container. Therefore, the apparatus of the present invention can be constructed at lower cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Superfluid helium (He II) is now used as a cryogen for cooling infrared detectors in deep space surveillance, on satellite orbits. For measuring the volume of the liquid, while cooling is necessary, the method actually adopted is one of heating the liquid with a heater and estimating the volume from the relation between temperature rise and specific heat. The present invention can also provide a noticeable improvement from such an inefficient measurement method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The measuring means of the present invention can be applied, not only to the volume measurement of liquid, but also to the volume measurement of solid. ASTRO-E, which is a joint program by NASA of USA and The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) of Japan, employs a technique of cooling an X-ray detector with solid neon, and application of the present invention thereto will also permit measurement of the residual quantity of such a solid coolant. </paragraph>
