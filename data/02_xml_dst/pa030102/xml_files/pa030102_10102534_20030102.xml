<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Methods for providing a virtual coupon are disclosed. One aspect of the present invention includes a method for creating a virtual coupon by a merchant, wherein creating includes defining a coupon offer location. The method also includes presenting the virtual coupon to a consumer device only if the consumer is within the vicinity of the coupon offer location or the consumer otherwise indicates an interest in goods and/or services in the vicinity of the coupon offer location. The virtual coupon is presented to the consumer&apos;s device in a format compatible with that device. A simple graphical user interface allows complex coupon campaigns to be constructed and managed by merchants using relatively simple data entries. Consumer identities, consumer profiles and/or statistical information concerning the response of consumers to the virtual coupon campaign are also provided to facilitate marketing and targeting of consumers in a defined location. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The need for consumers to identify merchants to obtain goods and/or services within a particular geographical area and the corresponding need for merchants to make their presence known to the consumer in that area has long been recognized as an important aspect of business contact. The classic, hard copy solution to the need is exemplified by directories that cover a particular geographical area, for example a telephone book for a city, where addresses and contact information for merchants within that area are organized by category in alphabetical order. The consumer in need of services within the area consults the directory, views the entries and selects merchants based on the consumer&apos;s recognition of the merchant&apos;s address. Often merchants provide some form of advertising in such directories to attract attention to their particular presence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One problem with hard copy directories is that they are bulky and time consuming to use. Another problem is that the information is not location specific other than being within the region covered by the directory. Still another problem is that the information stored in such directories is necessarily static, therefore, merchants are not able to immediately update records or provide continuously updated information such as special product offerings, coupons and the like. For this, merchants rely typically on newspapers and/or direct mail campaign within the desired geographic area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More recently, the World Wide Web has become an important resource that provides directories, databases, web sites, web pages and a variety of merchant information in electronic form, stored on a server that can be accessed by the consumer through use of a personal computer. Typically, the consumer uses some sort of search engine to search the World Wide Web for certain words or concepts related to the class of goods or services that they seek. In some cases, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) may assemble merchant information by category to permit consumers to search databases for merchants listed within those categories. In other cases, a program may be provided that allows consumers to query the database with a location field, typically a zip code or address, in order to obtain a list of merchants having nearby addresses or zip codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One of the problems with the World Wide Web is that it is not location specific for either the merchant or consumer. The merchant is unable to target consumers within a specified geographical location because the merchant relies on the consumer to discover the merchants presence through an active search. The consumer must conduct a search, specify a location, and usually proceed through multiple steps in a series of database queries each time the consumer wants information. In essence, the consumer must &ldquo;pull&rdquo; information from the databases based on the consumer&apos;s skill in locating a proper search engine or application for constructing an effective search. Another problem with the World Wide Web is that the merchant information is not variable according to location. For example, if a merchant has special offers in one geographic location but not another, the only way to distinguish the offers in the different locations is to have multiple database entries (e.g., multiple web sites or multiple pages within a site), or to provide an overview of all offers, which requires the consumer to further search to discover whether the offer is good in the consumer&apos;s location of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Mobile communication technology now permits consumers to access the World Wide Web using portable devices such as cell phones, portable computers, portable digital assistants, &ldquo;BLACKBERRIES&rdquo; and the like. These devices use a varied assortment of protocols and/or formats for receiving and transmitting information including, for example, Wireless Application Protocol, HTML and E-mail. These technologies allow consumers to access information from a mobile platform without being restricted by physical location. Mobile connection to the World Wide Web has all the same limitations as the World Wide Web with regard to consumer searching to locate merchants. Another problem with mobile communication technology stems from the variety of protocols and formats in use, which prevents merchant information from being communicated to the mobile device unless the information and the device use compatible protocols and formats. Still another disadvantage is that these technologies also do not permit the consumer to input location specific information although the consumer is in-fact moving between a variety of locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another type of information service combines mobile communications with various position determining equipment (PDE) to send or receive positional information regarding the consumer&apos;s locations. Enterprises that provide positioning equipment and/or locating services are variously called Location Service Providers (LSP), Mobile Positioning Centers (MPC) or Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) services. Example technologies for locating a consumer&apos;s position include GPS systems, assisted GPS systems (A-GPS), time domain of arrival systems (TDA) or signal triangulation systems. One example of a commercial A-GPS service is provided under the service mark NORTHSTAR, which uses positioning satellites to identify the latitude and longitude of a consumer equipped with GPS positioning equipment. The longitude and latitude are in turn received by the service provider which uses the information to conduct a database search to find merchants located in the vicinity of the consumer. Such services have the same limitations as the World Wide Web in terms of locating merchants because the service provider also must pull information from a database using an active search. Merchants are not able to make their presence known to the consumer unless specifically requested by the operator or provider of the service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is, therefore, a need in the art for methods and systems that put merchants in contact with consumers on the basis of location, so that a merchant&apos;s presence may be made known to the consumer in a location specific manner, and which allows the consumer to readily find merchants within a location without the need for active database query instructions. In particular, there is a need for methods and systems to allow merchants to create and present coupons to consumers in a location specific manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention fulfills these and other needs that will be apparent from the following description of various aspects of the invention. An illustrative aspect of the invention includes a method for providing a virtual coupon to a consumer. The method includes providing a graphical user interface that receives coupon information in an electronic medium. The coupon information includes a description of goods and/or services offered by the merchant under merchant defined promotional terms for a defined limited time period, an identifier of the merchant, and a defined location for the coupon offer. The method further includes receiving information from a consumer device that includes an indication of the consumer&apos;s location. If the indication of the consumer&apos;s location overlaps with the defined location for the coupon offer and is received within the defined limited time period, then the coupon information is presented to the consumer device in response to receiving the indication of the consumer&apos;s location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the coupon information includes merchant defined profile information defining attributes of the consumer. In these embodiments the act of receiving also includes receiving consumer defined profile information defining the attributes of the consumer. The coupon information is then presented to the consumer device only if the merchant defined profile information overlaps with the consumer defined profile information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The method may further include providing a register that records a number that is incremented each time the coupon is presented the consumer device. The method may also include receiving information indicating the consumer has redeemed the coupon by accepting the promotional terms offered by the merchant and decrementing the recorded number each time a coupon is redeemed. In certain embodiments, the methods may include assigning an identifier for each coupon presented to the consumer device. These embodiments may further include matching the identifier for each coupon with an identifier of the consumer, where the identifier of the consumer is received when the coupon is presented to the consumer device. Other embodiments may include matching the identifier for each coupon with the identifier of the consumer when the consumer has redeemed the coupon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Certain embodiments also include determining a protocol and/or a format that is compatible with the consumer device and using a device interface to transmit the merchant presence to the consumer device using the compatible protocol and/or format. Compatible protocols and/or formats include, HTML, XHTML. Web format, Wireless Application Protocol, Wireless Markup Language (WML), Voice extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML), Short Message Service (SMS), and E-mail. Some embodiments further include tracking the activity of each consumer in regard to transmissions of the merchant presence. Typically, activity tracking is selectively enabled by the consumer or the merchant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Certain embodiments include tracking the position of the consumer using geo-positioning information provided by the consumer device on a continuous or periodic basis. In these embodiments, the coupons delivered to the consumer device continuously change and are continuously pushed to the consumer device as the consumer changes physical locations.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, electrical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;merchant presence&rdquo; is information content that is stored on electronic medium that concerns goods and/or services provided by a merchant and an identifier of the merchant, which is transmitted from the merchant to an electronic communication device of a consumer. The term &ldquo;wired&rdquo;, with respect to a communication device includes any hard line data communication conduit, including, for example, cable, telephone lines, fiber optic lines and the like. The term &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; includes any device that communicates data without need of a hard line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; refers to any person, business enterprise or other entity that desires to obtain goods and/or services from another. The term &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; refers to any person, business enterprise or other entity that provides goods and/or services to another. Merchants become consumers when they seek goods and/or services and consumers become merchants when they provide goods and/or services. Accordingly a single person, business enterprise or other entity may be a consumer in one circumstance and a merchant in another. Therefore, the terms merchant and consumer are not exclusive of one another. A &ldquo;user&rdquo; refers to any person, business enterprise or other entity that communicates with, and/or subscribes to, a service that implements the methods and/or systems described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates features of merchants, consumers and locations used in various embodiments of this invention. A plurality of merchants offer goods or services from a plurality of defined points of origin for the merchants <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The merchants&apos; points of origins may be precisely defined, for example, by an address or by positioning coordinates such as longitude and latitude. The consumer is similarly located at a defined point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The consumer may define a geographic area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> surrounding the consumers point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for which goods, services or other information may be desired. Typically, the consumer may wish to define the area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> differently from time to time. At one time the consumer may, for example, define the area of interest as within a city, while at another time may define the area of interest as within a neighborhood, on a street, or within a certain defined distance from the consumer&apos;s home or present point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The size of the area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be user defined, assigned by a service provider, or selected by the consumer from a list of options. The area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may for example, be defined as a geometric area encompassed by an ellipse or rectangle with a perimeter located a specified distance from the consumer&apos;s points of origins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the service area may be defined by socio-political boundaries, such as the boundaries of a neighborhood, city or other circumscribed region The areas of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may, therefore, be any size, for example, as small as the width of a shop window or as large as a state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The consumer&apos;s point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may change discretely, for example, when the consumer moves domiciles, or may change continuously over time, for example, during a trip where the consumer travels from point A to point B and thereby crosses a number of points of origin exemplified by points <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> traversed during the travel. The trip may be on a large scale, for example, between cities, or on a small scale, for example, down a city street or retail mall. As the consumer changes from a first point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a second point of origin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the geographic area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> changes with the consumer&apos;s location. At various points, the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> encompasses different merchants at different points of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, there are provided methods for merchants to transmit their presence to a consumer based on the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the merchant&apos;s point of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Merchants typically desire to make their presence known to consumers when the consumer is nearby, i.e., when the consumer&apos;s point of origin and/or area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is essentially the same as the merchant&apos;s point of origin, overlaps with the merchant&apos;s point of origin, or comes within a service area targeted by the merchant. Conversely, the consumer is typically most interested in knowing of a merchant&apos;s presence when the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is near the merchant&apos;s point of origin. Accordingly, when the consumer is at point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the consumer will preferably want to know of the merchant&apos;s presence at point of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, when the consumer is at points <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the consumer will preferably want to know of the merchants at points of origin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, respectively. When the consumer is at points <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the consumer preferably wants to know of the merchants at points <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this aspect, the merchant actively transmits it&apos;s presence to a consumer device upon receipt of an indication that the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes the merchant&apos;s point of origin. In one embodiment, the merchant receives the indication of the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> directly from the consumer device. In another embodiment, the merchant receives the indication of the consumer&apos;s area of interest indirectly from a position locating service. In yet another embodiment, the merchant receives an indication of the consumer&apos;s area of interest by directly detecting the consumer device using position detecting equipment. Thus, with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the consumer is at the first point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the merchant&apos;s presence at point of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is automatically transmitted to the consumer, while if the consumer is at a second point of origin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the merchant&apos;s presence at points of origin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are transmitted to the consumer device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of this aspect of the invention. In this embodiment, the merchant&apos;s points of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are surrounded by a geographic service area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> defined by the merchant, within which the merchant desires to target consumers. The merchant&apos;s geographic service areas <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be defined in a similar manner as the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e., by assignment, selection, geometric area or by geographic boundaries. The merchant&apos;s presence is transmitted to the consumer only if the consumer&apos;s defined area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> overlaps with the merchant&apos;s defined service area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. For purposes of illustration, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the size of the consumers area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as smaller than the merchant&apos;s service areas <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, however, it will be understood that both these areas can be defined to suit the needs of either type of user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, the information content of the merchant&apos;s presence is in one form if the consumer is at a first distance from the merchant&apos;s point of origin, and in a second form that differs from the first form, if the consumer is at a second distance, that differs from the first distance. In these embodiments, the type of presence the merchant desires to transmit to the consumer is conditioned on the point of origin of the consumer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in addition to the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, in cases where the consumer indicates an area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is relatively large, such as within a city, or a point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at a distance that is relatively far from the merchants&apos; points of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the merchant may transmit a first type of generic message, such as &ldquo;come and see us downtown&rdquo;. In other cases, where the consumer indicates a point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is relatively small and/or near the merchants&apos; points of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the merchant may transmit a different type of specific message, such as &ldquo;We have a table opening now.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, the indication of the consumer&apos;s point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and/or area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is received in at least one of three non exclusive modes: a site mode, a sensing mode and a scan mode. In the site mode, the consumer transmits a single indication of a particular location, typically defined by an exact point of origin such as an address, and receives only information regarding merchants at that particular location. For example, if the consumer device transmits &ldquo;101 Main Street, Small Town&rdquo;, only merchants located at that building address in Small Town transmit their presence to the consumer device. The request mode is, therefore, limited to information for a single location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the sensing mode, the consumer device continuously or (periodically) transmits changing indications of the consumer&apos;s point of origin as the consumer moves from location to location. The sensing mode typically requires that the consumer device be equipped with position detection equipment, such as a GPS or other system that allows the consumer&apos;s location to be tracked. In the sensing mode, the consumer obtains continuously changing information regarding the merchant&apos;s presence, which corresponds to merchants located in proximity to the consumer&apos;s continuously changing positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the scan mode, the consumer sends an indication of a point of origin and receives information concerning a plurality merchants at locations in proximity to that point of origin. The scan mode may be considered similar to the site mode, but with a larger defined area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments, the scan mode is a default mode that operates with an initially defined area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the consumer may set a larger area of interest in order to obtain a greater amount of information or a smaller area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to obtain less information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A large number of variables affect whether a merchant desires to make a presence known to a consumer and whether the consumer desires to receive the merchant presence. There may, for example, be a very large number of merchants in proximity to the consumer&apos;s area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which the consumer has no interest. Accordingly, in various embodiments, consumers and merchants pre-select or otherwise define categories of goods or services sought and offered, respectively. In these embodiments, the merchant&apos;s presence is transmitted to the consumer only if the consumer&apos;s category of interest is the same or similar to the merchants category of goods/and or services. In some embodiments, an indication of the category of goods or services is received simultaneously with the indication of the consumer&apos;s area of interest. In other embodiments, the consumer&apos;s category of interest is pre-assigned by a service provider, selected from a list by the consumer, or defined by the consumer, for example, using keywords. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a selectable category is a &ldquo;channel&rdquo;. A channel operates as a filter that restricts transmission of data to information that meets predetermined categorical criteria. Channels may include one category of information or may include a combination of categories. For example, one category may be &ldquo;movies,&rdquo; another category may be &ldquo;restaurants,&rdquo; another category may be &ldquo;mechanical services&rdquo; and yet another category may be &ldquo;gas stations&rdquo;. The first two categories may be grouped on a channel entitled &ldquo;night life&rdquo; while the latter two may grouped on a channel entitled &ldquo;automotive&rdquo;. The consumer may select a channel to receive an indication only of merchant&apos;s offering goods and/or services in the specified categories or channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A similar example of a category is a &ldquo;favorites list.&rdquo; The consumer defines a list of particular categories of goods and services for which the consumer is most often interested. The defined categories are saved on the favorites list so that the consumer can limit receipt of transmission of information from merchants to those merchants offering goods and services defined on the consumer&apos;s favorites list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, the use of categories is combined with the aforementioned modes of sending the indication of the consumer&apos;s location and of selecting the size of the area of interest <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide the consumer with various levels of control over the information transmitted by the merchants. For example, the site mode is typically used in the absence of a category filter because a single location is likely to have few merchants associated therewith. The sense mode is typically used with a broad category filter or no filter, but with a relatively small area of interest so that the consumer may receive all available information from location to location. The scan mode is typically used with a narrow category filter and a relatively large area of interest to obtain information regarding most of the merchants within the category even if their location is somewhat more distant from the consumer&apos;s point of origin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Another level of control over information transmission is a switch, or more specifically, a switch command, that allows the consumer to activate or inactivate any or all transmissions of the merchant&apos;s presence at the consumer&apos;s will. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a consumer view of a plurality of merchants&apos; presence transmitted to a consumer device in HTML format. The view is transmitted in a conventional Web layout window <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Within the Web window <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a banner indicating the operator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) has detected the presence of, or received an indication of the location of, a consumer device with a point of origin specified by GPS coordinates <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that appear in a point of origin field <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. In response, the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> automatically transmits a list of a plurality of merchants <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, identified by the subject of goods and/or services <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and the merchant creator&apos;s mark or name <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which are those merchants located within a certain distance as listed in distance field <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A plurality of detail buttons <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are provided for each merchant&apos;s presence, which enable the consumer to select further information for any of the plurality of merchants <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Upon activation of a detail button, a detail window <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is displayed that includes a name for a selected merchant <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> with a description of the merchant&apos;s goods or services <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Also included in the detail window <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are merchant specified option buttons <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, that link to an audio file (or other media) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or an electronic coupon <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which provides further information regarding the selected merchant <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and its offers. Electronic coupons are described in more detail in co-pending application Ser. No. ______. Keywords listed by the merchant, the merchant&apos;s URL address and other merchant information are displayed in the attached text fields <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Web link buttons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are also displayed, to permit the consumer to link to the merchant&apos;s Web site, merchant applications <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, or a mapping system <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), which automatically calculates and displays a map and/or directions to the merchant&apos;s point of origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a display transmitted to a consumer device that combines the scan mode with category criteria to limit the display of the merchant&apos;s presence to specified types of merchants defined by the consumer. The detected point of origin of the consumer device or the point of origin otherwise defined by the consumer is entered optionally as an address <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or as GPS coordinates <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The consumer is given the option to retrieve a list of preselected points of origin using a location field list <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, to save a default point of origin using a &ldquo;my location&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or to delete preselected points of origin using a delete button <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The consumer performs the scan using, for example, a keyword field <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or a category field <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Various optional services provided by certain types of merchants linked to the presence server may also be selected using a service field list <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> or a merchant defined filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The user may also be given the option to specify certain types of merchant information specified in a Boolean type list <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or by the creator or merchant name field <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In response to the scan, the mapping system <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is accessed to display a location map <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that includes an indication of the presence and location of a plurality of merchants <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in the selected categories. An optional &ldquo;locate me&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> enables the user to also display an indication of the consumer&apos;s point of origin on the same location map <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Transmission of the merchant presence does not await a search by the consumer. Rather, the merchant&apos;s presence is actively &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to the consumer based on the indicated location received from the consumer device without the need for the consumer to search. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the consumer receives the list <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of a plurality of merchants <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> solely based on the consumer&apos;s location rather than a search. As the indicated location of the consumer changes, so does the list <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of merchant&apos;s having a presence transmitted to the consumer device. To illustrate by example, as a consumer strolls down a city block the precise coordinates of the consumer&apos;s point of origin changes. If the consumer device is configured with an area of interest defined at 500 feet, is set in the scan mode or the sensing mode, then the merchant presence list <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> displayed at one end of the block will be different from the merchant presence list <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> displayed at the opposite end of the block&mdash;without requiring intervention by the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a system for providing the merchant&apos;s presence to a consumer whenever the merchant receives an indication from the consumer device that the consumer is near the merchant&apos;s location. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a basic system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to this aspect. The basic system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes various pieces of software and hardware that provide the merchant presence to the consumer based on receiving an indication of the consumer&apos;s location. The consumer interacts with the merchant through the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be any communications device equipped with electronics that allow the consumer to interact with the merchant, such as a wired device or a wireless device. Suitable consumer devices include, but are not limited to, mobile telephones, mobile computers, personal desk top computers connected to the World Wide Web, personal digital assistants, BLACKBERRIES and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The basic system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that reveals the merchant presence to the consumer. The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that structures the merchant&apos;s presence into a format and/or uses a protocol recognized by the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives a signal indicating that the consumer&apos;s location is near the merchant&apos;s location. The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes a communication port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transmitting the merchant&apos;s presence to the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the appropriate format or protocol. The communication port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be configured with a wireless or wired communication line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> selects the appropriate protocol or format for the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by receiving an indication of the type of consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The indication of the type of consumer device may be sent de novo from the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along with the indication of the consumer&apos;s location, or may be &ldquo;looked-up&rdquo; on a subscriber list that identifies the consumer, the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and appropriate format or protocol. Such a list may be contributed to by the consumer directly using configuration parameters applied when the consumer subscribes to a service for contacting the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the list may be obtained from another service provider, for example, a mobile communication service or LSP that equips the consumer with the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a Device Preferences GUI <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> that allows the identified user <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to configure their own consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for receiving presentations of information content in a protocol and or format that is compatible with their particular consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The Device Preferences GUI <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> includes a list of selected consumer devices <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that the identified user <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may use from time to time. These are typically selected from a master selection list <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that preferably includes a name of all known types of consumer devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with predefined formats and/or protocols. The identified user <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is able to set a default format for presentation of different types of information. For example, a default presentation field <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> determines the format the consumer prefers to receive presentation information while a default message field <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> determines the preferred format for receiving short messages. The Device Preferences GUI <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> also includes an enable button <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to selectively enable communication with the selected device <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. An E-mail field <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided for the identified user <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to enter a preferred E-mail address, a telephone field <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is provided for entry of a telephone number for the device, a device nickname field <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided to allow the identified user <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to apply different names to similar devices, and an SMS field <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is provided for entry of a path for SMS voice messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> selectively communicates to the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the communication port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> using the appropriate format and/or protocol for the type of consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, if the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can interpret hypertext markup language (HTML), the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may send information in the form of HTML pages to the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. User I/O compatibility is diverse and includes standard Web access, voice input through an IVR system, SMS messaging, E-mail, and other types of messaging technology. Accordingly, the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is configured to communicate to the consumer using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to Wireless Application Protocol, Wireless Metal Language (WML), Voice eXtensible Markup Language pages (VoiceXML), Short Message Service (SMS) or E-mail. Depending on consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> capability and configuration, the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be acting as transmitter to the consumer, receiver from the consumer, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes a storage medium <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a merchant interface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that enable the merchant to enter and store information concerning the merchant&apos;s presence, such as geographic point of origin, service area, name, category of goods and services, business mark, description of the business and the like. The storage medium may also store subscriber information regarding individual consumers. In various optional embodiments, the merchant interface also enables the merchant to define a Web site, define a Web page, define an E-mail, define keywords, define an audio file, define a video file, and/or define forms for interacting with the consumer. The storage medium <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> typically stores a database <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of merchant and/or consumer information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the merchant interface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which includes a graphical user interface (GUI) <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for entering or specifying a location of data for the merchant&apos;s Web based URL <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, E-mail address <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, telephone number <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, business category <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, summary identification message <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, promotional message <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and business mark <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The merchant&apos;s location in terms of geographic point of origin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and/or service area <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is defined in another form or sub form of the graphical user interface (not illustrated). Optionally, the GUI <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes a demographic statistics link <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that enables the merchant to track the activity and/or identity of consumers that receive a transmission of the merchant&apos;s presence over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The merchant optionally works with the setup page/wizard to create/deploy their presence and the consumer is presented with a consumer view of this presence. Merchants can log on to their personalized system account and navigate to their own customized location-based presence. This presence may be initially populated with personalization data taken from their own user accounts. From then on, the merchant can come back to their setup page/wizard and modify the various data associated with its presence. Thus, the merchant presence is not only actively communicated by the merchant, it is a &ldquo;live&rdquo; presence. Changes are immediately reflected into the overall system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Although the system has the capability to import (through various interfaces) merchant data from existing sources such as directories and directory services, the system allows merchants to independently subscribe to, and take full control of their presence. The overall accuracy of the system (both spatial and content) is therefore inherently more accurate than existing technologies that employ for example &ldquo;spiders&rdquo; that almost blindly attempt to index various merchant locations from existing Web pages using fields for the merchant&apos;s address or zip code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that includes various components for certain embodiments of the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This embodiment of the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a Web server <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that serves HTML pages. The merchant interface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be implemented to transmit Web pages to the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thorough the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> if the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can interpret HTML pages. The expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> include a VoiceXML server <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that provides Voice extensible Markup Language pages when the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to receive and interpret VoiceXML pages. The expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may also include a number of merchant applications <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The merchant applications <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> include programs that enable the merchant to tailor the merchant presence to merchant defined specifications, including the information necessary to define the merchant presence as well as programs for conducting business with the consumer The merchant applications <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may include, for example, demographic statistics and other tracking features that enable the merchant to keep records of contact with consumers. The merchant applications <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may also include various applications implemented by the merchant for doing business, for example for taking orders, making reservations, accepting forms of payment and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is configured with a number of other sub-systems and/or applications that enhance the merchant presence. These other systems include, for example, the mapping system <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The mapping system <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> provides the merchant point of origin, address and routing instructions to the consumer based on the received indication of the consumer&apos;s location. It may also be used by the consumer to map the location of a plurality of merchants within the consumer&apos;s area of interest as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes an audio processing application <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that allows processing of audio information for voice recognition, voice to text, or text to voice conversions. When configured with the device interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the audio processing application <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> allows transmission of messages a broad variety of consumer devices <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be as basic as a plain old telephone system (POTS) or as sophisticated cellular phone with digital personal assistant technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> typically includes various databases <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to keep information regarding the plurality of merchants consumers. In one embodiment, the database <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is implemented using Oracle, but any suitable database technology can be used, such as Microsoft SQL server. The database <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and respective application software may be used to create systems for storing the &ldquo;location&rdquo; and &ldquo;content&rdquo; merchant information. In addition these databases <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> may provide subscriber subsystems, billing subsystems, or administration subsystems to assist in commercial deployment of the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to serve a variety of users and markets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> depicted in the expanded system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be configured with a positioning application or position determining equipment (PDE) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that enables precise determination of the point of origin of the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using positioning coordinates determined by a location service provider (LSP) <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a mobile positioning center (MPC) or by direct communication with a global positioning satellite <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is configured to receive information as to whether a particular consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes the PDE <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and if so, what type. The presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may then utilize the positioning coordinates provided from the PDE <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> directly from the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to automatically detect the consumer&apos;s point of origin as it changes. Alternatively, the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may receive positioning coordinates from the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> indirectly from the LSP <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> or MPC. Another type of positioning is &ldquo;manual&rdquo; positioning where the user sets their position through normal data entry including latitude and longitude, address, cross street, zip, or by selecting location &ldquo;bookmarks&rdquo; or through selection of location history. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> only receives the positioning coordinates if the user first obtains the signal independently and then authorizes its transmission to the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, such as in the sensing mode, the consumer&apos;s location is tracked and the positioning coordinates are transmitted to the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> automatically. In these embodiments, the consumers position is tracked as the consumer moves. In still other embodiments, the consumer may store the most recent indication of the consumer&apos;s coordinates or the consumer&apos;s home position, and receive merchant information for that position whenever the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives an indication of that position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention enable merchants to easily create, deploy, and sustain a location specific wireless and non-wireless presence. The merchants can do so with or without assistance from a third party agent other than the provider of the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and that implements the methods disclosed herein. However, other third party providers such as ISPs LSPs and MPCs and the like may also utilize the system on behalf of their clients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> does not require significant design talent on the part of its users, other than operating a browser and filling out forms (e.g., formal web experience). Therefore, the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is available for use by a broad base of merchants and consumers. Some of these merchants may have expertise in web presence and others may not. The merchant presence captures the merchant information within a system application database <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, which also supports links to external sources. Merchants that already have a home page (wireless or non-wireless) can link these external sources to this location-based presence, thus, in fact automatically making their existing non-location enabled presence, location sensitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a more general aspect of the invention, the presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and transmission of the merchant&apos;s presence to a consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> based on location is part of an overall Application that allows a variety of users types to find, detect, track and interact through location-aware technology. The Application has aspects that extend to any location-aware reception and transmission of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In this more general aspect, any space in the physical world can be &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; to a defined location. For each location, a user of the system may create associations (e.g., a presence) that is stored on electronic medium in the virtual world. Any given location in space may have an untold number of virtual records or &ldquo;associations&rdquo; therewith, including for example, attachments, links or other annotations connected to the location. The virtual presence associated with the physical location is accessed using any communication device equipped with location specific functions, for example, a cell phone, appliance, PDA or other computing resource. To facilitate understanding of this broader aspect, it is helpful to further define certain terms to reach a common understanding of the meaning thereof: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;location&rdquo; is a reference to a feature in the physical and virtual world that has a number of dimensions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> One physical dimension of location is &ldquo;origin&rdquo; or &ldquo;point of origin&rdquo; which has been described previously herein to include at least one of an address or coordinates such as latitude and longitude that define a reference point for the center of the location. Any unique address represented in the conventional form by number, street, city, state and country has a corresponding unique representation in global positioning coordinates, and thus all points of origin are unique although they may have numerous forms of representation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Another physical dimension of location is &ldquo;size,&rdquo; which is a generic term for the area of interest (or service area) defined by a user as previously described. Typically, the size of a location may simplistically be defined by an ellipse, rectangle or other geometric boundary that encompasses an area. A radius, length, or other unit of measure of distance can then be used to describe the size of the location based on a reference to its origin and geometric boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> One virtual dimension of location is &ldquo;Context&rdquo; which is defined by a system operator or user to characterize the attributes of access and/or electronic interactions allowed between users and locations. Information, applications, or behaviors of locations may be different depending on the context that is applied to it. For example, a given location may have information that may be characterized as private, public, public moderated, or commercial. In this example &ldquo;private&rdquo; would classify information that is only accessible by a particular user or set of users, &ldquo;public&rdquo; would be accessible to all, &ldquo;public moderated&rdquo; would be managed by a third party, and &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; would be managed by a commercial enterprise. Other example of Context include those used in URL addresses on the World Wide Web, such as &ldquo;gov&rdquo; or &ldquo;edu.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Another virtual dimension of location is &ldquo;Category&rdquo;, which describes topic filters applied to the location under a particular context. A category includes, for example, user defined types and subtypes of information related to the location. One example of implementation of a category is a &ldquo;channel&rdquo; as previously discussed. For example, a channel may include specific category sets like Restaurant, Historical, Crime, Geology, Graffiti, Travel, and the like, or may include larger sets like Leisure that include several subsets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Another virtual dimension is &ldquo;meta data&rdquo; or keywords, which act as both a structured and freeform description pertinent to location. One example of this implementation could be specifying a restaurant category AND keywords such as &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;kids&rdquo; or &ldquo;fish&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Another virtual dimension of location is &ldquo;Time&rdquo; Any location may have a sense of time that is applied to attachments and other associations as a time stamp. Users access the location in the time domain as well as the physical domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Yet another virtual dimension of location is &ldquo;Behavior,&rdquo; which relates to how the association or attachment of information is stored or communicated. Behavior may differ based on the user access device, the user, the Context, the Category, the Time, etc. Behavior is typically implemented by program applications. Behavior examples include, but are not limited to, items like &ldquo;notification,&rdquo; &ldquo;display,&rdquo; &ldquo;sound bite&rdquo; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Content&rdquo; is the actual virtual information associated with location and stored on computer readable medium. Content can be anything, for example: text notes, SMS, WebPages, WAP, voice memos, sound, images and the like. Content can be stored by value or by reference. Locations can be absolute or regionalized into &ldquo;views&rdquo;. Behaviors can be created for locations and/or particular location views. In one aspect, content creation is provided to users on an ad hoc basis to facilitate ease of use, and self-propagation of content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The Content of information associated with the location may also have various &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. Example properties include, &ldquo;type&rdquo; which includes descriptive forms such as E-mail address, URL, audio file and the like. Another property of Content is &ldquo;Persistence&rdquo;, which determines how long the author or creator of the content desires their contribution to persist. Yet another property is &ldquo;Security,&rdquo; which is a user definable attribute of access. Although some level of security is provided by the Context, particular users may apply different levels of Security to their information content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Another property of Content is &ldquo;Selected Area.&rdquo; As mentioned above, a location includes a defined area of interest or service area, however, the user may wish to select a smaller or larger area of interest (radius) for particular purposes based on particular conditions. For example, a user may select a large area of interest when accessing or transmitting location information about a city, or select a smaller area when accessing or transmitting location information about a street. Different Content may be transmitted depending on the Selected Area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Content Behavior&rdquo; is a property similar to the behavior dimension of location, but associated with content. For example, when a piece of content is accessed there may be a prescribed behavior associated with the access. This could be as simple as registering how many times the content is accessed, by whom, when, etc., or as complex as executing a series complex scripts or program applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In typical embodiments, this system interacts with locations by interfacing with existing LSPs, MPCs or other position tracking services. Suitable commercial LSPs and MPCs are exemplified by companies such as SignalSoft, Cell-loc, and Ericcson. For example, Signal Soft implements a mobile location service with their LocationManager product. Such products provide the locating hardware and software needed to communicate the positioning coordinates and other &ldquo;where&rdquo; based functions required for large system implementation. The LSP or MPC provides interoperability between service regions and disparate equipment and technology providers. The LSP or MPC may also provide application developers with a common API with which to develop location specific applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The Application provides a standardized method of interacting with wireless resources to provide consistent usability across the Application &ldquo;System&rdquo;. The infrastructure easily supports advanced functionality through the inclusion of location and content external reference calls based on user actions. User actions may include both location and content events. It provides an overall framework that supports by design (out of the box) most of the &ldquo;informational&rdquo; types of &ldquo;applications&rdquo; that would otherwise require discrete applications to be developed and deployed. The Application grows with contributors and users and does not need massive content initialization. The Application may be used ad hoc but is also amenable to structure and commercialization because it provides &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; organization to combine Location, Content, and Time within a common controllable application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic overview of one embodiment for organization of the Application <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> that underpins a network of presence servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> described herein. The Application <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> includes a central database/application herein designated the &ldquo;System&rdquo; <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and &lsquo;n&rsquo; number of distributed databases/applications herein designated a &ldquo;Realm&rdquo; <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is a centralized service that links Realms with Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The System database may be deployed at a single centrally located geographical site or may be distributed through a number of sites by linking a network of servers. The System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> applies application and business rules to the interaction of Users and Realms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The Realms <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are distributed applications and databases. Realms <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> interface with the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to manage User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> activity and accounting, User rooming events, and other system wide interactions. The Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes Service applications <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, that in turn organize and operate on Location specific <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> information for the Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the location information, and the Presentation objects <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> needed to present the Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to the Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Hence, the primary function of the Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is to manage the list of Location objects within each Realm. A Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> administrator is constrained to administration of Locations within its respective Realm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> accounts are created and managed by a system object. User objects on the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> capture the User&apos;s <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> identification, account information for billing, telecommunication details such as type of communication device, telephone number, communication protocol, format, device type or model, and positioning capability. Other User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> specific information managed by the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes, security information, preferences, and other details specific for individual users such as &ldquo;buddy lists.&rdquo; A &ldquo;buddy list&rdquo; is a user defined list of other Users with whom User defined location specific information is shared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The location objects implement the data and behavior of geographical entities. Locations <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are added to a Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> databases based on Realm logic and a creation event. When a Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is initially created, there are no Locations <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Locations <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are initialized by the creator of the Realm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or through a creation event of the Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Locations <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> include points of origin, areas of interest, service areas, locations size and the like. All locations contain Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Table 1 illustrates one example of a Location <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> structure.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The size of a Location <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is determined by the resolution capacity of the positioning technology and of this application. If the location determining equipment or LSP can only provide a resolution of, for example, 300 feet then the user&apos;s position will fall somewhere within that 300 foot area. If a user were then to request information within 200 feet, the inability of the LSP to resolve to 200 feet will result in a default to the highest resolution possible, i.e. 300 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The size may be User selected, System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> selected, or determined by the type of equipment used by the User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. For example, a LSP servicing a given type of User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> with a given type of PDE may return a default &ldquo;size&rdquo; that will include an origin and the approximated resolution e.g. an origin with a radius of uncertainty, which may, for example, be expressed as plus or minus some distance unit or in some other form. This resolution and therefore &ldquo;size&rdquo; will change if equipment is swapped out with higher or lower resolution technology or as upgrades to the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> occur. This size factor determines if a User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is in or out of a defined Location <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Locations <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may have one or many Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> associated with them. The Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> provide utilities and behaviors that allow the Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to interact with the Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and applications associated therewith. Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are primarily identified by their Context and topic. When Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> subscribe to the Service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the User&apos;s <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> reference is attached to the service. A reference to this user is placed within a service personalization database. The user is now part of that service &ldquo;community&rdquo;. Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are organized by the Context in which they will be used. Table 4 illustrates some features of various service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> items.

Each of these will perform some Service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> specific function. OnSubscribe may validate billing and perform other subscription tasks. OnActive indicates to the Application that a User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is currently actively using the System. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can draw on a preference interface that allows Services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> to dynamically add preference pages to a User list of preferences. The user object would therefore include service management in its portfolio of capabilities. Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may access their personalized setup which will include device type/model, preferences for messaging, selection of services, and other preferences which will assist them in modifying the behavior of their experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The Users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> operate within specified Context provided by the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Context in many ways is similar to &ldquo;domain&rdquo; as used with respect to the organization of the World Wide Web. In order to prevent confusion and more clearly denote functional differences, the term &ldquo;Context&rdquo; is applied to the location specific Content using the methods and systems disclosed herein. The Context of a Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> item describes how that Content is accessed and controlled. Context supports security and exclusivity.

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> This initial set of Context&prime; are suitable to cover public, personal, commercial, government, and educational organizations. The use of &ldquo;BuddyList&rdquo; pertains to a list of users that may be set up by a Context administrator or by the User. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a Private Service GUI <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that allows users to establish a private moderated Context for other users that will have access to the location-specific content established by a particular user. Typically, a business user will use the Private Service GUI <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to create a private moderated context to enable only certain types of other users, for example, employees, business associate, vendors and the like, to access information content concerning the business. The Private Service GUI includes a service category field <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that defines the category for the service and a service name field <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> that defines a name for the particular business user. A group list field <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is provided to allow users to set up specified lists of other users analogous to a buddy list. A hot key option <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is provided to enable users to instantly access information content from the private service by use of a single entry key from the consumer device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A service description field <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is also included to allow the business user to provide a short description of the groups and or functions provided by the private service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Topic&rdquo; refers to categories of information that are organized by related content or subject matter. When Context and Topic are combined, they may function like &ldquo;channels&rdquo; which limit the type of content transmitted to users <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Topical Content may vary depending on the Context&prime; with which they are accessed. For example, a Topic called &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; within the Context of &ldquo;com&rdquo; (commercial) will access Content that has been generated by restaurant proprietors within a selected Location. A Context of &ldquo;pub&rdquo; under the same Topic and Location will access Content that has been generated by the public regarding restaurants in the Location. Realms <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are preferably deployed with a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; set of Topics and additional Topics may be added. Table 3 illustrates example Topics and the Content provided therein as a function of Context.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is preferably ordered by both System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> preferences and by User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> preferences. Ordering of some topics may be by &ldquo;nearest&rdquo; or by &ldquo;best&rdquo; or other characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The Presentation <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> will vary widely depending on device. Robust presentation objects are used to implement this through the device interface. Presentation objects may also be constructed to support multiple Presentations <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from a single Content source <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> based on user preferences or equipment. For example, the Presentation <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the same Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> could be text for one user <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, voice mail for a different user or an HTML page for a third user. In addition the User <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may have multiple capacities for receiving Presentations <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and may change the preferred type of Presentation <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from time to time. A default type of presentation is optionally stored in a user preference file. One advantage of the separation of Presentation <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from Content <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is that this permits flexibility in the design of the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to respond to changes in technologies and in device capability or performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The following Examples illustrate various features, services or other aspects of the invention that may be implemented in various embodiments using the systems and methods described herein. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Traffic Information </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A user accesses a presence server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, enters his or her work address as a point of origin, selects a channel designated &ldquo;com.traffic&rdquo; from a PDA. The user receives a map displaying a plurality of highways and thoroughfares surrounding the point of origin and receives up to date reports on the traffic on the various routes provided by a real time traffic service. The user then activates a position determining GPS device configured with the PDA to obtain and transmit the users position. As the user travels down a selected route the GPS coordinates change and are transmitted to a plurality of receiver locations along the route, which in turn transmit updated traffic maps and reports at each location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this system the traffic application may be executed from either within the processing environment of the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or externally from the traffic information provider&apos;s site. The Application may, for example, acquire a real time traffic feed from a government agency such as the Department of Transportation, or from a commercial provider. This information would be parsed and stored for the various locations along known traffic routes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In an alternative procedure, the user proceeds down the route with a mobile phone configured with position determining equipment activated to transmit the consumer&apos;s position. The user had previously configured the mobile device to receive traffic route information. When the consumer&apos;s position is detected at a location along the route with updated traffic information, the consumer&apos;s cell phone is dialed by an automated computer system and a voice message is transmitted to the consumer regarding an accident has occurred near that location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The user&apos;s preference for alerts and format thereof are set through account management through the system application. The System application places corresponding traffic alert content in the respective private.traffic Context for that user. Presentation of this Content is via the associated presentation object. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Location Touring </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Government agencies, and/or commercial enterprises create information content regarding various attractions and amenities available in a defined geographic area, such as a city. The content is attached to locations within the city that are stored on a database operated in the context of a commerical.tours service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> When a user accesses this service, for example, through a mobile communication device, the service executes an application script contained in the OnSubscribe field in the Service data table. An OnSubscribe handler then prompts the user to accept a charge for this service that will be placed on their mobile service carrier bill for the user. If the user accepts the charge the service is enabled for that user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The user activates their mobile communication device e.g. a cell phone and proceeds with a physical tour of the geographic area. As the user navigates from location to location on the tour, the Content specific for different location on the tour is presented to the user&apos;s device as per the user&apos;s preferences, i.e., through a Voice tour, SMS messages or other format. The user may opt to manually send location information for each site that is reached by entering an address or street intersection, may have the user&apos;s location automatically sent to the service from a LSP or MPC as the user&apos;s position is tracked, or may obtain GPS coordinates for each location and then transmit that information to the service when desired. The user may request a route for a preselected tour, or make the tour extemporaneously. Optionally, the user may select certain channels within the tour, for example, a historical channel, that sends historical information regarding various locations in the vicinity of the users position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Electronic Coupons </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Retail locations create an electronic coupon message as Content for their location under a service such as retail.coupons within the System. A user that accesses this service and that comes to a location in the vicinity of the business will be sent the coupon message automatically and in the users preferred format for their communication device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> This aspect provides methods for creating and presenting a virtual coupon to a consumer based on the consumers location. In one embodiment, merchants subscribe to a service that implements the location-based merchant presence methods described herein. The service provides a graphical user interface that enables merchants to readily create, modify, or update a virtual coupon and to present that coupon to a consumer device upon receipt of an indication that the consumer is within, or otherwise indicates an interest in, a location that overlaps with the coupon offer area defined by the merchant. The virtual coupons may be actively &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to the consumer based on receiving an indication of the consumer&apos;s location, or &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; by the consumer based on an active search executed by the consumer. In either case, the consumer may optionally have selected a channel or otherwise set a category filter that includes promotions or coupons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for creating a virtual coupon according to this aspect. The coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; type of form that executes complex programming instructions based on simple data entries. The coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a format selection option <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that allows the merchant to select a format for the coupon, for example, a text format <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or audio format <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Selection or removal of these options (and other options provided in the coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) is conveniently accomplished using selection buttons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of type options <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with fields for entering data for particular types of coupons, for example, percentage value discount <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, dollar value discount <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, cash back offer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, or non-cash merchandise offer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (e.g., a free T-shirt). Also included is a title field <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for providing a coupon title and a coupon message field <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for entering the information to be communicated to the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> further includes a text to speech conversion option <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that allows the message to be converted from a text format to an audio format, or vice-a versa, so that the coupon may be presented in text form to consumer devices configured to receive text messages, or as a voice mail for consumer devices configured to receive voice messages. An audio select option <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is also provided to direct the wizard to access a prepared audio file for the message content. Moreover, the coupon may be presented to the consumer device using any protocol or format recognized by the device, including any those previously discussed herein. The coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes term period fields <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to enable the merchant to define a start and termination time for the coupon offer. Predefined options for the term period may also be selected from a list in period option field <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Typical predefined options may include, for example, &ldquo;no termination period&rdquo;, &ldquo;two weeks&rdquo;, &ldquo;one month&rdquo; and the like. A maximum number of coupons to serve field <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is also provided to terminate coupon offers when the specified number of redemptions are transmitted to users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A redemption code field <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is also provided to help track the coupon campaign. The redemption code <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> identifies the coupon by a number or other identifying mark such as a barcode or image. The wizard uses the redemption code to establish a registry that keeps track of the number of times the coupon is presented to a customer, and/or the number of times the consumer presents the coupon for redemption. Typically, the registry includes a counter that is incremented each time a coupon is presented, and decremented each time a coupon is redeemed. In optional setups not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> number is assigned to each coupon that is presented to a consumer. In other options, the consumer&apos;s identity is also received and stored when the coupon is presented to the consumer device and/or presented for redemption by the consumer. The assigned number of each coupon may can then be matched with the consumer&apos;s identity and tracked with respect to offers and redemptions of goods and/or services promoted by the coupon. Merchants may also devise their own systems of tracking. Redemption codes may also be keyed into point of sale systems to further track coupon campaigns with respect to identifying the points of sale most often used by the consumer. The data obtained can be used to establish statistics for marketing and specific targeting of consumers based on their coupon use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a HTML formatted coupon view <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> pushed to the consumer device operating in the sense mode or the scan mode, or pulled by the consumer using an active location specific search. The coupon view <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is similar to the merchant presence view <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and includes a banner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that identifies the provider of the service (or presence server), a point of origin field <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> depicting positioning coordinates <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> indicated by the consumer device and a list of a plurality of merchants <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which in this case, are merchants offering virtual coupons in location area that overlaps with the consumer&apos;s indicated location. The list <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> includes each identified merchant <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and a short message <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> showing a summary of the coupon offer. Again, the distance of the identified merchants <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> from the point of origin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> indicated by consumer is depicted in the distance field <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the author or merchant name is depicted in author field <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and detail buttons <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are provided to permit the consumer to obtain additional information about the coupon offer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> An individual coupon offer from a particular merchant is displayed in coupon display window <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> that provides a more detailed description that includes the type of coupon offer <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight>. An audio button <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also provided to enable the user to hear an audible version of the merchant&apos;s coupon offer.

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The coupon creation GUI <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is designed with the specific goal of supporting a broad merchant skill base. Complex business and transport logic is masked by an easy to use interface that can be readily utilized by technical novices or used with greater complexity in optional setups by more technically savvy merchants. The virtual coupon method provides automated business logic for selecting a number of different types of incentives or offerings. Merchants control their coupon campaign by specifying logistical parameters such as when the campaign starts, ends, how many coupons to serve, and the duration or time a coupon is valid. The merchant also has explicit control of the campaign, for example, a simple checkbox allows a merchant to immediately stop or restart the campaign (coupon) delivery. The merchant may also obtain demographic and statistical data regarding consumers, which can be used to improve the overall business of the merchant as well future coupon campaigns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Users of the virtual coupon, including both merchants and consumers, typically subscribe to this service and configure various parameters that affect the behavior of the service for themselves i.e., by providing customized categories and other preferences. Based on these preferences, information is proactively delivered to a consumer device. The service may use various predetermined or definable &ldquo;filters&rdquo; that allow any user of the service to create various criteria such as radius of interest or service area (e.g., within 14 mile from a specified location) and/or categories such as keywords, subjects, business types, offering types, time windows and the like. Because the service receives such information from both merchants and consumers it allows merchants to provide coupons to consumers based on matching profiles that define the attributes of the merchants and the consumers. This service can therefore, present coupons of specific interest to particular consumers and only those consumers within a defined geospatial area, time domain, or other dimension associated with location according to the descriptions provided herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> A commuter user routinely passes through a toll point, ferry, train or other transport service that requires a toll for use. The transport service establishes locations on the System specific for each location where a toll is required. The service may be organized under a category or channel denominated, for example, as Washington.tolls. The user activates the Washington.tolls service on a mobile positioning and communication device and then drives by a particular toll location. When the user enters the toll location, an indication of the user&apos;s presence is received from the device at the toll location, and an OnEnter event is executed that transmits the driver&apos;s license plate, identifying information and an electronic payment script that executes an electronic debit from an account owned by the user, to the toll service. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A father and his sons are out mountain biking and come across an outstanding view where they eat lunch and talk about life. To mark this occasion and moment the father pulls out his cell phone and he and his sons enter a voice message that is stored with an indication of the particular geographic location on a private class and sports channel service provided by the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> automatically timestamps the messages and attaches it to the location with a default radius for area of interest applied to the location. Alternatively, the father stores a digital picture or some other record of the location on other media. There is now a record of this family trip attached to that particular physical location. On this trip there may have been many others associated records made at different locations along the way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The location specific records are accessed in the comfort of the family home by contacting the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the World Wide Web when the family returns.

Two summers later, the father and sons take the same trip again. This time, along the way, they access the system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in a sense mode, choosing the same Context and channel as the records were stored.

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A restaurant owner has a Web site on the World Wide Web. The owner places this Web reference (URL) along with location data into the System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. When people in the area are attempting to sense any restaurant or the owner&apos;s restaurant in particular using a communication device, the presence server detects the presence of the device and the owner&apos;s Web page is transmitted to the potential customer in the consumer&apos;s preferred format. The chef may pick up a cellular phone that morning and enter today&apos;s specials via voice, text, or SMS message to the system. Potential patrons coming into that location will have an option to view the home page of the restaurant through a WAP, listen to today&apos;s specials through voice mail, or receive an SMS message on their device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> While in front of the restaurant the customer may access a public/Restaurant/Rating for that location. That public Context provides ratings tabulated from all previous entries members of the public (unmoderated), or from particular members of the public (moderated) which may, for example, be a food critic from the local newspaper. Concerned about how late it is and the safety of the area, the prospective customer could also obtain a public safety rating, or other information attached to that location <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on the system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> While in the restaurant, the customer (who has an interest in architecture) notes the age and beauty of the restaurant. The customer then accesses a Public/History channel for that location and is presented with anecdotes or other information contributed by others who have visited that location having a similar interest. For information that is more regulated or packaged, the customer may access a moderated version of this channel for a more &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; view on the history of this location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The patron may then wonder if they know who has eaten there before and if any messages were left.

Alternatively, if the user&apos;s device is not equipped with a graphical display, a list can be obtained by voice or text messaging. The list is sorted by proximity to the user&apos;s point of origin starting with the nearest venue. The user may also access comments left by the public or individuals on the user&apos;s buddy list who&apos;ve seen the movie. The user may also obtain location specific information about the theatre, the sound system, the popcorn, the seats and the like. The same concept can be applied to finding concerts.

When one user sends an indication of a particular location, and has a preference filter or channel set to &ldquo;personal interest&rdquo;, the user receives a message that lists the name and contact information for the other users associated with that location that share that interest.

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, location based personal interest channels may operate like a real-time personal ad. Users can arrange, for example, to meet fellow travelers with similar interests in a foreign country.

In an unrelated example, a user could advertise a ticket for sale at a location outside a crowded event and be contacted by people at the event who set up their profile to indicate they are interested in tickets, and/or are also located near the event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Conventional dating through personal ads based on location is also possible.

Safeguards and so called &ldquo;handshaking procedures&rdquo; would be used to control who can contact who. For example, if users did not want to give out cell phone numbers, E-mail address and the like, a location based message center could be established to exchange initial correspondence. </paragraph>
