<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for molding a honeycomb structure and a method for molding a honeycomb structure using the molding apparatus. More particularly, it relates to a molding apparatus for making a honeycomb structure useful, for example, as a catalyst carrier for controlling exhaust gases of automobiles, and a method for molding the honeycomb structure which makes it possible to reduce failure in formation of outer walls of the honeycomb structure by adding various functions to a press plate which fixes a spinneret. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Problems which become afresh are influences on earth environments and ecosystems of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride, etc. contained in exhaust gases of automobiles in addition to carbon dioxide which warms the earth. It is said that, in the future, automobiles which utilize as energy source, for example, electricity, natural gas or methanol which have less influences on the ecosystem will be substituted for automobiles which utilize gasoline and gas oil as energy source. However, there are difficulties to be overcome for practical use of these technologies, and tentative measures are reduction of cost of fuels and purification of exhaust gases. The honeycomb structures with which the present invention concerns are used for exhaust gas purification apparatuses of automobiles as a technology for the solution of environmental problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, honeycomb structures made of ceramics materials or metallic materials as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are used as catalyst carriers for exhaust gas purification apparatuses of automobiles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an oblique view of a honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a front view of the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a partially enlarged view of the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. This honeycomb structure is nearly columnar as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and comprises partition walls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having a honeycomb structure which form many cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and an outer wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> covering the outer periphery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For making such honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, an apparatus for molding honeycomb structures, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a vertical sectional view of an apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for molding honeycomb structure which is provided with back pore part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from which a molding material is introduced, a spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having slit a part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which ejects the molding material, and a press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> provided downstream the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Extrusion molding is carried out using this apparatus to make the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises inner side part <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and outer periphery part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and the inner side part <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> protrudes to downstream side to form a level difference part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> between the inner side part <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the outer periphery part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. At the press plate, there is provided a gap part <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which molds the outer wall of the honeycomb structure. Press jig <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and back press plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are holders for setting the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In carrying out extrusion molding by the honeycomb structure molding apparatus, the molding material is extruded from the upstream side of spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the downstream side through the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by an extruder (not shown) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The molding material extruded from slit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> provided in the inner side part <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> opened on the downstream side forms a honeycomb structure comprising many cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the molding material extruded from slit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided in the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> changes in its running direction to the level difference part <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> from the extrusion direction with rupturing of the honeycomb shape being caused by the action of the slit part <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and again changes in its running direction to the extrusion direction at the position where the press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> opens, thereby forming an outer wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> surrounding the cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in such conventional honeycomb structure molding apparatus and molding method, there is the problem of failure in formation of the outer wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As an example of failure in formation of outer wall, mention may be made of formation of waviness as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a front view of a honeycomb structure having wavy wall, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a side view of a honeycomb structure having wavy wall. It is considered that wavy wall portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is formed because the amount of the molding material becomes larger than in other portions and cells are ruptured to form waviness, and it is assumed that this is caused since molding speed of the outer wall part is higher than that of the part of the cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If this wavy wall is formed at various portions of the outer wall, failure in bending is caused. The honeycomb structure which is to be columnar is formed with undulation, resulting in increase of gas permeability resistance in addition to inferior appearance and thus the honeycomb structure is not suitable as product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As another example of failure in formation of the outer wall, there is the formation of burrs as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 11</cross-reference> and-<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a front view of a honeycomb structure having burrs, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a side view of a honeycomb structure having burrs. It is considered that the burr portions <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> are formed because the amount of the molding material becomes smaller than in other portions and the outer wall is not formed, and it is assumed that this is caused since molding speed of the outer wall portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is lower than that of the portion of the cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is considered to be inevitable that the molding speed of the portion of the outer wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> becomes higher or lower than that of the portion of the cells <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, since fluidity of the molding material cannot necessarily be maintained constant and there is variation in working precision of the spinneret or the press plate. The fluidity of the molding material is affected by various factors. For example, in the case of ceramics, the fluidity is affected by delicate variations of particle diameter or shape of the molding material, water content, kneading degree, atmospheric temperature and humidity, etc. Therefore, the fluidity of the molding material changes momentarily even in a day, and can hardly be maintained constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, change of fluidity of the molding material greatly affects the extrusion moldability. Therefore, it is necessary to select optimum shape or size of the press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> from a plurality of press plates before starting of the extrusion molding or to change thickness of the slit part <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. It is also necessary to select the back press plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of optimum inner diameter upon occasion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, even if the press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and others are set in the optimum state, the fluidity of the molding material is not necessarily stable owing to environmental changes at the use and variation of the molding material, and, as a result, satisfactory outer wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> cannot necessarily be formed. Therefore, it is necessary to stop the honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> each time and exchange the press plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> or adjust the back press plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. However, these measures are temporary ones to deal with the conditions such as environment under which failure of formation of outer wall occurs, but cannot be employed when the environment changes. Furthermore, these measures require a relatively long operation time, and hence there is the problem of sharp reduction of productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above problems, various means have been proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For example, JP-A-8-239701 discloses a metallic honeycomb body and a method for making the same. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an elevation sectional view of a die assembly of the disclosed apparatus for making metallic honeycomb bodies. Using the apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for making metallic honeycomb materials comprising combination of a mask <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a ring reservoir and a die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a skin forming slit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a suitable size, a plasticized batch material discharged outside from slots <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> near the peripheral part of the die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is discharged into adjacent but different two areas of the die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is, by discharging the material into the ring reservoir <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the closed surface of mask <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and into the skin forming slit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed between outlet surface and edge of mask opening part, honeycomb (cell portion) and outer skin (outer wall portion) are sufficiently bonded without causing separation, and thus a firmly integrated metallic honeycomb body having a thick outer skin can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, in the case of, for example, a ceramics molding material, it is known that being different from metal particles, the fluidity is greatly different depending on the flow direction of the molding material particles, and failure in formation of outer wall often occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> JP-A-9-277234 discloses an apparatus for molding honeycomb structures and a molding method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the disclosed apparatus for molding honeycomb structures. The molding apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for honeycomb structures comprises a metal mold <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having a slit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for molding the honeycomb structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a guide ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the guide ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has an opening edge part <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a pool part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and, besides, a temperature adjusting device <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for adjusting the temperature of the guide ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. By this temperature adjusting device <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, temperature of ceramic material for forming outer skin (outer wall) which is retained in the pool part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the guide ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and, as a result, fluidity of the ceramic material can be changed and, hence, the molding rate of the outer skin (outer wall) and that of the body portion (cell portion) can be coincided. Thus, formation of wrinkles, burrs, etc. can be inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, in the case of using a molding material inferior in heat conduction, sufficient heat cannot be given to the molding material only by the adjustment of temperature and sufficient effect cannot be obtained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The honeycomb structure molding apparatus of the present invention will be specifically explained by the following embodiments, but these embodiments should never be construed as limiting the invention and various variations, modifications and improvements can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The first honeycomb structure molding apparatus will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing one example of the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a partially enlarged sectional view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) explain the operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are partially enlarged sectional views showing two examples of the gap adjusting means provided at the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The first honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is an apparatus for making a honeycomb structure using as a molding material, for example, one or both of a ceramics powder and a metallic powder which are mixed with a molding aid. The first honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided with a back pore part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for introduction of the molding material and a slit part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for extruding the molding material. The spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises an inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is fixed by a back press plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provided on the upstream side and a press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provided on the downstream side. Spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and back press plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are held by a press jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the press jig <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supported by a die holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is protruded to the downstream side to form a level difference part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> between the inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In more detail, the slit part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided at the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises slit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided at the inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and slit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided at the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is opened at the portion of downstream side opposite to the inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, namely, nearly the central portion, and simultaneously presses the downstream side of the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> spacing a gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed between the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, thereby fixing the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a part through which the molding material passes, and includes the gap formed between the level difference part of the spinneret and the press plate. The width of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> means a distance between the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which face each other nearly in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> capable of changing the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided at the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises a flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and an adjusting instrument <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which flexes the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In the gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, position at which the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed or size of the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is not limited as far as the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be varied by the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> adjusts the width of the part through which the molding material passes, and does not limit the position of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be adjusted. As the gap adjusting means, mention may be made of, for example, type A and type B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the type A comprises a thin flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> provided at the face opposing the downstream side of the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and an adjusting instrument <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which press the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in contact therewith. The gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the type B has a portion in the flexible part <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> which flexes to the downstream side in the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, namely, the side opposite to the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and adjusts especially the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed between the level difference part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of type A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is flexed by adjusting device <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in vertical direction, and thus the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be adjusted. After adjusting the width of the gap as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the flexible part <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is fixed at a desired position by the adjusting device <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. As the adjusting device <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, there may be employed, for example, a screw which pierces the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with its head being exposed on the upper face of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of type A is provided at the inner peripheral end part of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in opposing the innermost part of the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is preferably provided at a plurality of positions with dividing the inner periphery of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at equal intervals although this is not shown. It is preferred to provide them at 6 positions or more so that the positions are vertexes of a polygon. The range of gap adjustment of this gap adjusting means is generally about 0-0.50 mm, which is effective for inhibition of occurrence of failure in formation of outer wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention, a molding material is extruded from the upstream side of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the downstream side through the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by an extruder (not shown), and the molding material extruded from slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided at the inner side part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the downstream side of which is opened forms a honeycomb structure comprising many cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as in the conventional technique, the molding material extruded from slits <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided at the outer peripheral part of the spinneret <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> changes its progressing direction from the extrusion direction to the direction of the level difference part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the honeycomb form being ruptured by the action of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and again changes its progressing direction to the extrusion direction at the opening of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> thereby forming an outer wall which surrounds the cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The first honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is provided with the gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as mentioned above, and the extruding speed of the molding material can be easily increased by narrowing the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the extruding speed of the molding material can be easily decreased by broadening the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Therefore, for inhibiting occurrence of failure in formation of the outer wall, it is not necessary to prepare a plurality of shapes or sizes of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and select an optimum one from them or to change thickness of the gap part <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> or inner diameter of the back press plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as in conventional techniques, and thus the productivity is conspicuously improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the molding material can be extruded with adjusting the width of the gap of the gap part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, not only occurrence of failure in formation of outer wall can be further diminished, but also an outer wall of the more uniform thickness can be formed. Therefore, orientation of the outer wall portion of the honeycomb structure is improved, and heat conductivity can be further lowered, and, for example, when the honeycomb structure is applied to a catalyst carrier for purification of exhaust gas of automobiles, distortion and cracks hardly occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the gap adjusting means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is provided at a plurality of the positions with dividing the inner periphery of the press plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at equal intervals, and hence can adjust the gap in a wide range, and occurrence of failure in formation can be inhibited in the whole area of the outer wall of the honeycomb structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> are partially enlarged sectional views showing one example of the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention is an apparatus for making a honeycomb structure using as a molding material, for example, a ceramics powder which is mixed with a molding aid. The general view of the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is not shown, but is the same as the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus, except that the gap adjusting means is not provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is characterized in that it has a reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> comprising a ring dented part provided, at a press plate <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, outside by a given length L from the innermost end of a face opposing the downstream side of an outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of a spinneret <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> with facing a gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. Volume of the dented part of the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is preferably 1.8 times the volume of the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which is inside from the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and parallel to the spinneret. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The volume of dented part of the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> means in more detail not only the volume of the dented part, but also the volume of the gap part facing the dented part of the press plate <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and is the portion indicated by Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the volume of the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which is inside from the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and parallel to the spinneret means the portion indicated by Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention, a molding material is also extruded from the upstream side of the spinneret <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the downstream side through the spinneret <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> by an extruder (not shown) as in the conventional techniques, and the molding material extruded from slits <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> provided at the inner side part of the spinneret <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which is opened at the downstream side forms a honeycomb structure comprising many cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as in the conventional technique, the molding material extruded from slits <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> provided at the outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the spinneret <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> progresses with changing its progressing direction from the extrusion direction to the direction of the level difference part <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> with the honeycomb shape being ruptured by the action of the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and again changes its progressing direction to the extrusion direction at the opening of the press plate <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> thereby forming an outer wall which surrounds the cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this case, most of the molding material extruded from slit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is adjusted in its amount to be extruded before reaching the level difference <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> by the buffer function of reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. That is, even in the case of the slit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> being provided at the same outer peripheral part <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the molding material extruded from slit which is remoter from the level difference <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> changes in the speed of lowing the narrow gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> with change of environment or change in fluidity caused by variation of raw materials and causes change in thickness of outer wall formed by the extruded molding material, but the change of speed of the molding material passing through the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> provided in the vicinity of the innermost end of the press plate <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and, thus, an outer wall of more uniform thickness can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since when the molding material flows into the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> from the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, the material particles turn so as to easily move and flow in the same direction, variation of fluidity is relaxed and an outer wall of more uniform thickness can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, if the volume of the dented part of the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is 1.8 times the volume of the gap part <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> which is inside from the reservoir part <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and parallel to the spinneret, measures can be made against the change of fluidity of the molding material which may occur. Under such conditions, according to the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention, variation of thickness of the outer wall can be controlled to the range of about &plusmn;0.05 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, a temperature controlling means which can be added to a third honeycomb structure molding apparatus having the characteristics of the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus or the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus, or both the first honeycomb structure molding apparatus and the second honeycomb structure molding apparatus, namely, having the gap adjusting means and the reservoir part will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing one example of the honeycomb structure molding apparatus having a temperature controlling means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the honeycomb structure molding apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a temperature controlling means <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> comprises a hollow passage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> provided in the press plate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a water feeding device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which allows a circulating water of a desired temperature such cold water, warm water or the like to flow through the hollow passage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through a piping <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. By changing the temperature of the circulating water to control the temperature of the press plate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, temperature of the molding material extruded from the spinneret <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be indirectly controlled. It is preferred to provide a heat insulator <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> between the press plate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a press jig <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so as to inhibit escape of heat to the press jig <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The range of temperature control of this temperature controlling means <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is preferably about 5-35&deg; C. Furthermore, the temperature controlling means <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is more preferably such that a temperature control meter is provided at one or both of the press plate <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and spinneret <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a heating and cooling device capable of heating and cooling the temperature of circulating water is provided at water feeding device to impart an automatic temperature controlling function which controls the temperature of the circulating water based on the temperature measured by the temperature control meter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The temperature of the molding material passing through the gap part, namely, the molding material per se which forms an outer wall can be controlled by this temperature controlling means <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it becomes possible to control the molding speed of the outer wall without changing fluidity caused by change of environment at use or variation of starting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In detail, when molding speed of the outer wall becomes slower than that of the cells, and burr is considered to be formed, the molding material is heated to improve fluidity of the molding material for the formation of outer wall, and the molding speed is increased to allow to meet with the molding speed of the cell portion. As a result, occurrence of failure, namely, occurrence of burr can be inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is considered that wavy wall may be formed because the molding speed of the outer wall is higher than that of cells, fluidity of the molding material for the formation of the outer wall is reduced to lower the molding speed to meet with the molding speed of the cell portion. In this way, occurrence of failure due to the formation of wavy wall can be inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The honeycomb structure molding apparatus of the present invention can be constructed by suitable combination of the above-mentioned characteristics, namely, the gap adjusting means, the reservoir part and the temperature controlling means. Therefore, in conformity with the characteristics of the molding materials such as ceramics and metals, construction of apparatus can be selected which is low in cost and effective for inhibition of occurrence of failure in formation of outer wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be explained by the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting the invention in any manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Failure in formation of outer wall in the molding step of each example was evaluated in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (Method of Evaluation on Failure in Formation of Outer Wall) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A molded article was molded from an extrusion molding machine, and it was examined whether failure in formation of outer wall such as formation of waviness (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) or burrs (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) occurred or not. When the press plate provided with gap adjusting means or temperature controlling means as shown in the present invention is used, the occurrence of failure in formation of outer wall is inhibited by using the inhibition means. Extrusion length extruded during the time from inhibition of the failure in formation of outer layer being attained by the inhibition means until the next failure in formation of outer wall occurred was measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The molding materials for extrusion molding were prepared in the following manner to obtain two kinds of molding materials A and B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (Method for Preparation of Ceramics Molding Materials) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In order to make a cordierite honeycomb structure, given amounts of talc, kaolin and aluminum hydroxide shown in Table 1 as starting materials were weighed, respectively, and they were mixed to obtain a starting material batch. Next, as a kneading step, to 100 mass % of the resulting starting batch were added 4 mass % of methyl cellulose and addition water, followed by carrying out kneading by a kneading apparatus (not shown) to obtain a kneaded product. At this kneading step, temperature of the kneading apparatus was controlled so that the temperature of the kneaded product reached 10&deg; C. Then, the resulting kneaded product was deaerated by passing through a vacuum room and re-kneaded to prepare a columnar molding material A. This columnar molding material A was put in an extrusion molding machine and extruded to obtain a cordierite honeycomb structure.
