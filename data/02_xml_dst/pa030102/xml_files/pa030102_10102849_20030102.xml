<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the invention are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> First, an outline of a data broadcasting system of the invention is explained. This data broadcasting system broadcasts multimedia information composed of video, audio, text and the like mainly to terminal devices mounted on mobile units or portable terminals. At this time, as broadcast service, not only the programs are provided, but also it is a main aim that the program content itself may present flexible information depending on the need of the user and the status of use. Also, in the case of plural broadcast services, by merging with existing media, broadcast services are presented from a new viewpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To realize such broadcast services, this system is intended to broadcast mainly to mobile units and portable terminals by using a broadcast satellite or a communication satellite, and employs the CDM (code division multiplex) system as transmitting method and the MPEG4 (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group 4) system as coding method, and uses an S band for downlink from the satellite to the terminal device. By such format of broadcast, multimedia information composed of video, audio, text and the like can be received in mobile receiving terminal devices such as car-mount type or portable type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As stated above, this system is assumed to use MPEG4. By contrast to the conventional moving picture coding method that simply codes an image as one scene, the MPEG4 is designed to express a scene by synthesizing stratified video/audio signals composed of plural AVOs (audio/visual objects: component elements represented by figure and background). Stratified component elements may be either natural video/audio or synthetic video/audio. Either the entire scene or part of it may be expressed. Further, there is a large degree of freedom for overlapping of component elements and time and space relation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> That is, in this system employing the MPEG4, at the transmission side, plural contents (objects) composing one scene, and scene descriptive data for combining these contents are coded into an elementary stream by an appropriate algorithm individually, and multiplexed and transmitted. At the reception side, the received objects and scene descriptive data are decoded, and each object is synthesized according to the contents of the scene descriptive data, and issued to a presentation device such as display and speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In such system configuration, since each scene of program contents is composed of one or more contents and transmitted, the contents can be selected and reproduced as required at the reception side. Accordingly, part of program contents can be selectively reproduced depending on the specification by the user, specification by the broadcasting station, or condition of use, so that the program itself can present flexible information depending on the need of the user or the status of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, when the contents are synthesized and presented by using the scene descriptive data only, an inappropriate presentation may be made depending on the status of the terminal device. For example, in the case of regional contents, if such contents may be always displayed, contents being not related with the own present position may be displayed in the terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in such new broadcasting system, it is proposed to allow free selection of nation-wide broadcast and local broadcast, by specifying broadcast service areas individually by plural broadcasting stations. In this case, at receiving terminals of mobile unit mount type or portable type, it is beneficial for the users if desired broadcast services can be selectively receiving while moving along, and if merged with existing media, such as ground wave broadcast (television broadcast, radio broadcast) or communication means through public communication network, a new life environment will be presented to the users, which may contribute to advancement of the society of the information age. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The data broadcasting system for solving these problems is explained below while referring to preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing a general configuration of the data broadcasting system of the invention. This system is a kind of satellite broadcast, but it is called mobile satellite broadcasting (MSB) system herein in order to distinguish from the existing BS or CS digital broadcast for stationary receiving terminals, and its broadcast wave is called MSB wave. Nevertheless, the invention is not limited to the mobile satellite broadcasting system alone, but may be applied also to the data broadcasting system transmitted mainly to mobile receiving terminals at low transmission rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> This mobile satellite broadcasting system comprises at least one mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a satellite control station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a mobile broadcasting satellite (geostationary satellite) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives program information compiled and edited by plural program providers, multiplexes each program information in channels, converts into broadcast signals, transmits to the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through an uplink of, for example, Ku band (12.5 to 18 GHz). The channel multiplexing method is the CDM (code division multiplex) system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a Ku band antenna <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having an aperture of, for example, 2.5 m class, and an S band antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (for example, 2.6 GHz) having an aperture of 15 m class, and its operating status is monitored and controlled by the satellite control station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The broadcast signal transmitted from the mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is received by the Ku band antenna <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and converted into an S band signal by the transponder, and this converted broadcast signal is transmitted from the S band antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the service area through an S band downlink. Herein, in the S band downlink, plural channels (for example, 30 channels) having a transmission capacity of 256 kbps are multiplexed. The method of coding transmission information is the MPEG4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The aperture of the uplink antenna <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> mounted on the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be smaller than 2.5 m class, and the aperture of the S band antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not limited to 15 m class, but may be 8 m class. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the service area, for example, in the receiving terminal device (not shown) installed in office or home or in a mobile receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of car-mount type or portable type, the broadcast signal transmitted from the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the S band downlink can be received. Each receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such as mobile receiving terminal or car-mount receiving terminal accesses each server <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by way of public network (telephone line) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It can be also connected to the network such as the Internet (Web). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are composed as follows. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a circuit block diagram showing a configuration of the mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a circuit block diagram showing a configuration of the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> First, the mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an authoring device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The authoring device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> compiles scene information conforming to the MPEG4 by selectively using audio data AU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to AUn, video data MP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to MPn, and text data TX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to TXn supplied from program providers. The scene information comprises plural objects, that is, the audio data, video data, text data, and scene descriptive data for combining these objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The audio data, video data, text data, and scene descriptive data issued from the authoring device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are respectively put into an audio object encoder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a video object encoder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a text object encoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a scene description encoder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In these encoders <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the audio data, video data, text data, and scene descriptive data are encoded into elementary streams by appropriate algorithm suited to each property. The coded elementary streams are sequentially multiplexed into a specified format in a multiplexer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a multiplex stream is obtained. The multiplex stream is digitally modulated in a transmitter <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, further converted into Ku band broadcast signal, and transmitted from a transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> toward the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a receiving antenna <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for receiving the S band broadcast signal transmitted from the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The broadcast signal received in this receiving antenna <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is put into a Receiver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the Receiver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the broadcast signal is converted in frequency, and digitally demodulated, and the demodulated multiplex stream is put into a demultiplexer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The demultiplexer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is to separate the multiplex stream into plural elementary streams, and each elementary stream is input into an audio object decoder <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a video object decoder <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a text object decoder <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and a scene description decoder <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, respectively according to the type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The audio object decoder <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, video object decoder <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, text object decoder <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and scene description decoder <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are designed to decode the audio object, video object, text object, and scene descriptive data respectively from the entered elementary streams, and the decoded audio object, video object, and text object are put into a combining section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A through a Selector <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> individually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The scene descriptive data decoded in the scene description decoder <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is put into a scene description analyzer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This scene description analyzer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> analyzes the behavior of each object from the entered scene descriptive data, and the scene description analysis data SC is put into the Selector <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and combining section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. The Selector <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> passes the objects necessary for synthesizing the scene on the basis of the scene description analysis data SC, and the combining section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A combines each object on the basis of the scene description analysis data SC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also has a status determination database <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A for processing depending on the status of use preliminarily. In this status determination database <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A, the type information of the objects to be presented is stored preliminarily. The objects are managed as being divided into default data and setting data. The default data is the data already written in the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> before shipping. The setting data can be arbitrarily set and registered by the user by manipulating a key input unit (not shown) in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The combining section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A comprises a presentation controller <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A and a database update controller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The presentation controller <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A determines, for example, whether the battery is being used or the commercial power source is being used (the battery is being charged), and determines the status of use of the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the basis of the determination result, that is, whether being carried or received in stationary status, then compares the present position depending on the status with the region stored in the status determination database <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A. When the region including the present position is being stored, the object corresponding to this region is selected from the plural receiving objects entered from the Selector <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and this selected object is synthesized according to the scene description analysis data SC, and is supplied to the display <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> or speaker <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The database update controller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A updates the corresponding data in the status determination database <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A, according to the contents analyzed by the scene description analyzer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, when database update data is sent from the mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by using the scene descriptive data. Update process includes change or deletion of already registered object, and addition of object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, comprising a mobile phone function, also has a function of accessing various servers or connecting to the Internet through telephone lines. </paragraph>

On the top of the terminal, a pair of antennas <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Several applications that can be realized by this system are specifically explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, mobile broadcast service by multiple channels and multimedia realized by this system is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing flow of data in reception and reproduction of mobile broadcast service in the receiving terminal device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, first, an EPG (electronic program guide) is displayed upon start. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of the EPG screen displayed in the receiving terminal device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The user selects a desired content from the plural contents of multiple channels displayed on this EPG screen (step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). The content is selected by moving the cursor to the desired content by up/down operation of the select and execute button <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and pressing the decision button. The information presented by the content is multimedia information, which includes all of image data of moving picture or still picture, audio data, graphic data, and text data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the content is selected at step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the stream data relating to the selected content is received (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), and the data attribute is determined (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The data attribute of the content is explained. The contents displayed on the EPG screen are classified into a type received and reproduced in real time corresponding to the selecting operation (real time reception type), a type started to be received corresponding to the selecting operation, once stored in memory, and reproduced according to user&apos;s instruction (first store type), a type received automatically, stored in memory, and read out from memory and reproduced corresponding to the selecting operation (second store type), a type combining the real time reaction type and first or second store type (parallel type), and a type combining them arbitrarily (complex type). In particular, as a specific example of the parallel type, when the image data of the content of the first or second store type is reproduced, the audio data is received in real time parallel to the reproduction, and the content is reproduced as BGM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the attribute of the content is determined to be real time reception type, the data from the satellite is received in real time (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A), and reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the attribute of the content is determined to be first store type, the data from the satellite is once received and stored (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B), and the stored data is read out and the content is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the attribute of the content is determined to be second store type, the data stored in the memory is read out (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C), and the content is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the attribute of the content is determined to be parallel type, the data from the satellite is received in real time, and further the data from the satellite is once received and stored of the data stored in the memory is read out (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D), and the content is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the attribute of the content is determined to be complex type, the data is received in real time, and stored and read out appropriately (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>E), and the content is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, if the content is changed during or after reproduction of content, the process goes back to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the selected content is reproduced in the similar procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In such configuration, the user can individually select a desired channel from plural channels, and view at a desired timing. At the contents providing side, by setting the contents providing form such as real time type or first or second store type depending on, for example, quantity of data, contents of adequate quality and high degree of freedom can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment relates to contents preliminarily stored in the receiving terminal device of the system, in particular, to an application for reproducing the contents demanding reproduction permission information (so-called reproduction key) for viewing all information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing an example of operation relating to reproduction of contents preliminarily stored in the internal memory in the receiving terminal device. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the EPG screen of the contents stored in the internal memory is displayed (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). The contents stored in the internal memory are automatically updated by the downloading and storing function of the receiving terminal device. This function is explained in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the user selects a desired channel (step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), the content corresponding to the selected channel is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). In the following explanation, it is supposed that the content selected at step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> requires input of reproduction permission information (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;reproduction key&rdquo;) on the way in order to reproduce all of the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When reproduction of selected content is executed, in the midst of content reproduction, a screen urging input of reproduction key appears (step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Such content demanding reproduction key includes, for example, a pay program. In this case, for instance, guidance information such as &ldquo;Use of pay content&rdquo; is displayed to inform the user that it is a pay content, telling that input of reproduction key is necessary to view continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The receiving terminal device, corresponding to the predetermined operation by the user, automatically accesses the server presenting a reproduction key (mobile broadcasting center providing mobile broadcast, or contents provider, etc.) through the mobile phone function, and acquires the reproduction key. In this manner, in the content demanding reproduction key, it is preferred to acquire the telephone number of the connection destination from the data upon start of reproduction, and access the server automatically according to the reproduction continue operation so as to acquire the reproduction key and execute the input process. However, when acquiring the reproduction key by other mobile phone than the receiving terminal device, it may be configured to enter the reproduction key separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As the method of collecting fee of pay contents, for example, the mobile broadcasting center processes according to the acquisition (purchase) of reproduction key, adds to the reception fee or the like, and collects from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> When the reproduction key is entered, returning to the content reproduction screen, the content can be viewed (step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> According to the contents providing service of the embodiment, by using the MSB wave, the contents desired by individual users can be provided independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Modified examples of this service include the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Not limited to pay contents, of course, free contents may be also used. For example, free video for advertising purpose, or free mini game (simple game of small quantity of data) for service purpose may be also provided. In this case, the flow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is terminated at step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the receiving terminal device should incorporate an automatic filtering and storing function for automatically downloading the information corresponding to the desired channel in the MSB wave (that is, the information corresponding to a preliminarily selected channel) at specified timing, and storing in the internal memory (or hard disk in some case). In this automatic filtering and storing function, the information stored in the internal memory is periodically updated, and this updating is realized, for example, in four aspects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, whether the channel stored in the memory is reproduced or not, the newly received channel information is always overwritten. According to this aspect, if the user does not operate particularly, the stored channel information in the memory is automatically updated to the latest contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, of the received channel information, only the channel information already reproduced in the memory is overwritten. By doing so, the individual data corresponding to the status of use by the user can be updated, and it prevents the accident of erasure of the un-reproduced channel information that is saved to be reproduced later by overwriting while the user does not know so that it cannot be reproduced. Moreover, the user can update the contents of the reproduced channel information to the latest contents without artificial operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, which channel information in the memory is to be overwritten is selected at every reception of MSB wave, for example, by the user in the interactive format. In this aspect, too, the individual data is updated depending on the status of use by the user, and it avoids the accident of erasure of the un-reproduced channel information that is saved to be reproduced later by overwriting while the user does not know so that it cannot be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect, without overwriting on the existing channel data, new information is stored as far as the memory capacity permits. In this case, a plurality of contents of past channel information can be saved, and can be selectively reproduced at a desired timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> These examples are designed to select the channel information to be stored by using the automatic filtering and storing function of the receiving terminal device. By contrast, by registering the attributes preliminarily in the receiving terminal device, for example, on the basis of the individual information and classifying the information to be provided at the transmission side by each attribute, the information may be provided in a format that can be received only in the receiving terminal device having the specific attribute. For example, since the receiving terminal device is mostly used personally, an attribute &ldquo;male in their twenties&rdquo; may be registered in the receiving terminal device, and the transmission side provides information about &ldquo;male in their twenties&rdquo; by adding the identification data of this attribute, so that the information can be received and reproduced only in the receiving terminal device in which the corresponding attribute is registered. Such configuration is beneficial for distributing advertisement of merchandise aiming at a particular customer layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment relates to an application of store of a secondary channel while a main channel is displayed and broadcast, in particular, when storing the provided contents in the internal memory in the receiving terminal device of this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a series of process from reception of contents to store of contents in the receiving terminal device. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, first, an EPG screen is displayed (step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). When the user selects a desired channel from the EPG screen (step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>), the data relating to the select channel is acquired and the content is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). Herein, the selected channel is a concept of a secondary channel. Acquisition of data at step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is executed by real time reception or the like depending on the type of the content provided by the selected channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an example of timetable of channel information to be provided. At step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is assumed that the user selects content A at channel 1 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In the same time zone, at channel 3, content B relating to content A (that is, secondary channel) is being on air. In this case, preferably, the display screen at step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> should show the information that the secondary channel (content B) relating to the video channel being viewed at the present is on air, together with the video of content A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the display screen shows information of &ldquo;button d&rdquo; showing presence of secondary channel relating to the content of the displayed channel. By the display of this button d, the user easily knows that there is other channel providing desired information, aside from the displayed one. For example, by clicking the button d (step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>), by script or interrupt, the channel is changed from 1 to 3, and the content B of secondary channel is displayed (step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>). Meanwhile, similar process is done by pressing a relating program display button <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the receiving terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When changed to channel 3, the video of content B is displayed on the screen. The user can store or reserve to store the data of content B by specified operation (step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). When store of content B thus set is completed, it is preferred to tell the user by audio or video means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> When process at step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is over, channel 3 is returned to the initial channel 1, and the user can continue to view content A (step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). Or the user can reproduce and view content B whenever and wherever desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In mobile broadcast, contents can be shared and linked with other media by making use of features of digital broadcast. A fourth embodiment relates to an application of link of contents between mobile broadcast and other media. As a specific example, a novel contents providing method is proposed by merging broadcast and communication by linking contents of mobile broadcast and contents of Internet communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a series of process from reception of contents of mobile broadcast to access to common contents provided on the Internet, executed by the receiving terminal device in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, first, an EPG screen is displayed (step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>). The user selects a desired channel from the displayed EPG screen (step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). In this case, the selected channel is for providing contents linking with the Internet. The receiving terminal device receives the data of the selected Internet linking type contents (step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>). At this time, accompanying the data broadcast channel, URL data of Web page sharing the contents is also received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The content is reproduced according to the received data, and the user can view the channel (step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). Suppose the viewer is receiving and viewing contents relating to shopping displaying many catalogues. By turning page by page, when desired to access the Web site relating to the page of the contents of interest, the user operates as specified, and can access the desired Web site by making use of the mobile phone function of the receiving terminal device (step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> At the connected Web site, if the user desires, it is also possible to purchase on the Internet by the individual validation procedure explained below or the like (step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Thus, by sharing and linking the contents between the mobile communication and other media, a new contents providing method can be realized. As a result, more information service can be provided to the users more easily and promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (Fifth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment relates to a contents providing method requiring individual validation, in particular, and an application of purchasing a horse race betting ticket from the receiving terminal device is explained. This application is realized by simultaneous multichannel receiving function of mobile broadcast and its always-storing function. Accordingly, it realizes the service capable of accessing the horse race information control centers operated across the nation in real time, purchasing pari-mutuel tickets, acquiring information of race results, and receiving the payoffs on the spot. The processing procedure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, first by using numeric keys, receiving channels are selected by the simultaneous multichannel receiving function (step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), and these channels are received simultaneously (step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). At this time, samples of pari-mutuel tickets by mark sheets at local racecourses usable commonly in channels are also received simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Of the received plural channels, the channel for receiving video service is selected and set (step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Next, the user enters the security code, and completes the individual validation (step s<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>). Depending on the contents provided by the channel, it is required to identify the user by the individual validation. In such contents, preferably, at the step of progress, input of security code or the like is demanded, and the contents can be supplied only when the user is duly identified. The entered security code is transmitted to the broadcasting center or the like through the mobile phone function, and is registered and verified. When the user is validated at the center, the receiving terminal device receives the script file (reproduction key) from the server of the center, and the subsequent contents reproduction is started depending on the receiving and executing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Along with the progress of the contents, the receiving terminal device receives, stores and reproduces the race information (information of horses running for the race, betting information of each race, etc.) at selected specified race courses (step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>). At this time, when using samples of mark sheets received at step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, from the viewpoint of convenience of users, it is preferred to display the samples having the race course names and race numbers already filled in according to the received race information. As a result, user&apos;s marking errors can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Referring to the reproduced race information, the user enters the betting horse names in the single, double, or series competition system, and race result prediction in each category. The entered race result prediction is uploaded in the betting server, for example, through the Internet according to the stored program together with the data relating to the channel (step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> When betting on other race successively, the process of step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After the race, the information of each race result is taken out in seamless sequence, and the race result and payoff can be checked. The user can remit the payoff to the bank through the Internet (step S<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Thus, by providing the contents demanding individual validation, the user can receive the service safely at a desired time and in a desired place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> (Sixth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A sixth embodiment relates to an application for realizing interactive information provision executed by merging mobile broadcast and other media. Various forms may be considered as the interactive information providing service by using this system, and the following example is presentation of interactive education service by making use of the multichannel simultaneous receiving function, storing function and communication function in data broadcast of the receiving terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Individual Learning&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing flow of process of an application executed in individual learning service. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the receiving terminal device simultaneously receives plural education channels and stores in the memory by its multichannel simultaneous receiving function (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). Herein, the education channels are supposed to be curriculum data of different levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> When the user selects the curriculum data suited to one&apos;s level from the stored plural education contents, the receiving terminal device downloads the educational material contents from the corresponding education channel depending on the selection (step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). At this time, it is preferred to be configured so that special contents such as new contents or pay contents may be downloaded only after individual validation by input of security code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The user can learn by reproducing the downloaded educational material contents in the receiving terminal device or other connected device (step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The result learned by the user at step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the evaluation center through the Internet or the like by the communication function (mobile phone function) of the receiving terminal device (step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>), and scored and commented at the evaluation center, and an evaluation report is compiled, and transmitted to the receiving terminal device through the Internet. The user receives the evaluation report (step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>), and selects or purchases the education content corresponding to the evaluation, or accepts the education advice according to the evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Mass Learning at School, etc.&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a flowchart of the process executed in mass learning service at school, etc. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the receiving terminal device simultaneously receives plural education channels and stores in the memory by its multichannel simultaneous receiving function (step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). Herein, the education channels are supposed to be curriculum data of different levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> When the user selects the curriculum data suited to one&apos;s level from the stored plural education contents, the receiving terminal device downloads the educational material contents from the corresponding education channel depending on the selection (step S<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>). At this time, depending on the characteristics of contents, it is preferred to be configured so that the contents may be downloaded only after individual validation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The downloaded contents are distributed (transmitted) in batch to education tools (auxiliary tools) possessed by individual students that can communicate with the receiving terminal device possessed, for example, by the teacher. Using the education tools, the students individually learn and answer the questions (step S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When the students finish learning and answering the questions, the results are uploaded to the receiving terminal device of the teacher, and summation and individual evaluation reports are compiled on the spot (step S<highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The students select or purchase the education content corresponding to the individual report evaluation, or accept the education advice according to the evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, answers or the like of students uploaded in the receiving terminal device may be transmitted to the evaluation center through the Internet by the communication function (mobile phone function) of the receiving terminal device. At the evaluation center, the evaluation reports to students are compiled, and the results are transmitted to the receiving terminal device through the Internet, so that more advanced education service may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is an example of interactive education providing service. However, not limited to interactive manner, a sufficient educational effect can be expected by education information service by mobile broadcast only, and the industrial merit is also noted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> (Seventh Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A seventh embodiment relates to a novel contents providing method realized by utilizing this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The contents providing method according to the embodiment is applied when providing the user with contents composed of moving picture and sound such as movie. That is, the contents composed of moving picture and sound such as movie are large in the quantity of information and are generally pay contents. If all of such contents are uniformly transmitted to all receiving end terminals, it takes too much time in transmission and it is not practicable. Further, whether to acquire such contents or not should be preferably selected freely by the user, for example, by viewing a sample preview and deciding whether or not to acquire the whole data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this application, in the case of a movie, for example, first stream data for reproducing the whole content of the movie (that is, complete moving picture and sound), and second stream data for excerpting and displaying several still pictures from the movie and reproducing the sound in synchronism with the still pictures (the sound may be either digested or complete) are provided individually. According to such providing method, information service can be provided, for example, by distributing free of charge the second stream data to general users as promotion contents, and transmitting the first stream data to the demanding users only after confirming individual validation and payment procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing procedure at the receiving terminal device side of the contents providing method relating to this application. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, first, the receiving terminal device receives the second stream data distributed from the contents providing server broadcast wave from the satellite (step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>). This distribution of second stream data may be intended as arbitrary distribution, or intended as distribution to specific receiving terminal devices only assigned with the specific attribute. In the former case, the reception is controlled at the receiving terminal device side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In the case that the first stream data and second stream data are transmitted by a same server, at the time of transmission, the server may automatically compile the second stream data from the first stream data. As a result, the data management may be unified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When receiving the second stream data, in the receiving terminal device, the content provided by the second stream data is reproduced (step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). This content is intended to promote the movie or curtail the quantity of transmission data, and is not intended to reproduce the complete content. In the case of a movie, the sound may be reproduced completely, while the still pictures are displayed, for example, at 10-second intervals in synchronism with the sound like a still shadow play. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> When the content provided by the second stream data is viewed, and the user judges whether or not to demand the first stream data for reproducing the complete content (step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>). If the first stream data is not demanded, that is, if the user does not wish to view the complete version of the movie, this service is terminated on the spot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if desired to view the complete content by acquiring the first stream data, the mobile broadcasting center is accessed by the communication function of the receiving terminal device (step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>), and the procedure for acquiring the first steam data is executed (step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>). This procedure includes, for example, the individual validation for distributing the first stream data to specific users only, and payment registration for distributing the first stream data only to the users completing the specified fee payment procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> When the individual validation at step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is completed, the first stream data is transmitted to the receiving terminal device (step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>), and the user can view the complete content. The first stream data may be transmitted to the receiving terminal device through the communication line or, instead, a removable recording medium may be presented to the user side by shipping or transportation. Or the first stream data may be provided to the user as the pay channel by means of mobile broadcasting network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The first stream data is generally large in quantity of data, and by attaching a terminal to a terminal dock, the first stream data may be stored in the terminal dock. The reception timing of the first stream data is not limited to step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, but it may be received together with the second stream data at step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, for example, so as to be reproduced by receiving a script file by individual validation at step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, when viewing the complete content at the terminal after viewing the second stream data, it is configured to acquire the first stream data after a specified procedure. But, not limited to this, after receiving the content providing service by the second stream data, for example, several compositions may be configured as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> First, depending on the users, some may prefer to see the movie on a large screen of a cinema instead of the terminal. In such a case, after viewing the second stream data, if desired, the user may access the ticket-booking center by the mobile phone function of the terminal and purchase a ticket of the film through the terminal. For example, by providing the contents including viewing of digested version by the second stream data and interactive purchase of ticket, a more sophisticated service may be presented to the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Secondly, some users may prefer to view the complete content by the home video system. In such a case, by a specified procedure to the service center from the terminal, it may be configured to be transmitted to the home computer by the Internet. Or by using a shipping system, a removable memory medium such as DVD may be directly mailed to the user&apos;s home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The image presented by the second stream data is not limited to still pictures alone considering from its purpose. The method of compression used in this application is assumed to be, for example, MPEG. By utilizing the characteristics of the MPEG, the composition of the second stream data may be modified, for example, as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the second stream data may be composed of video data reproduced by I image and B image, and audio data reproduced in synchronism with the video data, and the first stream data may be composed of video data and audio data for reproducing the complete content of the movie. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Second, instead of classification into I image, B image and P image, the extracted GOP (group of picture) may be composed of video data of second stream data. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the second stream data may be composed of the GOP extracted in a specific period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Besides, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, for example, in one image, every other pixel is allotted, and a first image and a second image are compiled from each full image, and a first image group may be composed from the first image relating to each full image, and a second image group from the second image relating to each full image. Besides, for example, every other scanning line may be allotted, and a first image and a second image may be compiled from each full image. Anyway, the information for reproducing the full image from the first image and second image must be transmitted together with the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> This has been the explanation of the application of providing contents by making use of this system. However, the technical concept of this contents providing method is not limited to the mobile broadcasting network, but may be realized by the existing infrastructure such as BS broadcast, CS broadcast, ground wave broadcast, or Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> By such information providing service, for example, the contents providers can distribute the second stream data of small quantity of data for promotion purpose. Therefore, the advertising cost necessary for promotion may be curtailed. Moreover, distribution of stream data by mobile broadcast will realize prompt, easy, and wide-range promotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> For the user, further, after viewing the second stream data, the first stream data for reproducing the complete content can be received, and therefore the time and memory resources may not be spent for reception of unnecessary data. At the same time, the user has an extended degree of freedom for selecting information providing service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> (Eighth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> An outline of a data broadcasting system utilizing mobile broadcasting satellite in an eighth embodiment (herein called mobile satellite broadcasting system) is explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing this system configuration. This mobile satellite broadcasting system receives broadcast waves sent out from a mobile broadcasting station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by a mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and transmits to a specified service area (throughout Japan). A mobile receiving terminal device (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;mobile receiving terminal&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for receiving the MSB waves transmitted from the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be connected to a mobile phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (or may be integrated), and is accessible to an Internet service provider <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> through this mobile phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The mobile broadcasting station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives program information compiled and edited by plural program providers, multiplexes each program information into channels, converts into broadcast signals, and transmits to the mobile broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through an uplink of, for example, Ku band (12.5 to 18 GHz). The channel multiplex method is CDM (code division multiplex) system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The mobile broadcast satellite <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, receiving the Ku band broadcast signals, converts into S band signals by a transponder. The converted S band broadcast signals are transmitted to the service area. By distributing broadcast waves in such high frequency band, MSB waves can be received by a relatively small antenna. This merit contributes to downsizing of mobile receiving terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as other infrastructure, an example of CS satellite broadcast is explained. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the broadcast wave transmitted from a CS broadcasting station <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is transmitted throughout Japan by way of a CS broadcasting satellite <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. At a CS subscriber&apos;s home <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, the CS wave is received by a CS antenna <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, and can be received and reproduced by a CS receiver <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> At this CS subscriber&apos;s home <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, by setting the mobile receiving terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the interface, a data storage control device (herein called store dock) <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> managing the stored data at the terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is prepared. This store dock <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> incorporates, for example, a large capacity memory medium such as hard disk, takes in the stored data from the terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and stores in the memory medium, and presents the stored data to the terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> whenever requested. The store dock <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> can also access the Internet service provider <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> through a telephone line, or can be connected to the CS receiver <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> through an IEEE1394 network, so that the CS broadcast program can be booked and recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Herein, the mobile satellite broadcast is mainly transmitted to mobile units and portable terminals. Accordingly, considering from the terminal store capacity and battery capacity, it is not realistic to download a large quantity of data for viewing programs. In particular, the mobile satellite broadcast is extremely low in data transmission rate as compared with the CS satellite broadcast. Accordingly, if the mobile satellite broadcast and CS satellite broadcast can be combined, it is beneficial for the viewers because information acquisition and viewing can be separately realized. As an aspect of such mode, an example of broadcasting brief information by mobile satellite broadcast, and broadcasting detail information by CS satellite broadcast is specifically explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, from a data provider (contents providing server) <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, brief information is distributed to the mobile satellite broadcasting station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and detail information is distributed to the CS broadcasting station <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, and these broadcast waves are supplied to the mobile receiving terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and CS receiver <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. The detail information is also distributed to the Internet provider <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and information providing devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> installed at convenience stores (hereinafter referred to simply as convenience stores). In the case of pay detail information, the data provider <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, Internet service provider <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, and convenience store <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> are linked to an electronic settling system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, so that the fee can be charged when downloading the detail information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In this system configuration, after viewing the brief information at the mobile receiving terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, if desired to view the detail information, the following acquiring method may be devised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> As the brief information, for example, supposing the detail information to be full motion image, the latest portion of the store type content, or the decimated image or still picture curtailed in quantity is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> When viewing the brief information while going out, if wishing to view the detail information on the spot, the user accesses the Internet service provider <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> through the mobile phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and downloads the detail information from the server. To save the communication charge, the user goes to a local convenience store <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, and accesses the server already receiving the detail information installed at the store through wireless LAN or the like, and downloads the detail information. To view later, accessing the store dock <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> via the Internet through the mobile phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the detail information of the CS broadcast is downloaded from the CS receiver <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, and by loading the mobile receiving terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into the store dock <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> after returning home, the detail information can be acquired and viewed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Further, specific examples are explained below. </paragraph>

Thereafter, the stored detail program can be viewed whenever desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> According to these specific examples, even in the data broadcast of narrow band, seeing that simple contents &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; can be distributed, it adds to the chance of purchase of contents broadcast in the CS of broadband or the Internet. Moreover, since the latest information portion is transmitted from the MSB waves &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;, the data can be updated all the time. When a main unit for connection is installed at a convenience store, the detail information can be stored before returning home from work, and it is very convenient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> When realizing such application, at the time of downloading the information in the terminal through MSB wave, it is helpful to build up a database describing the information in each file, such as the information to be used permanently or not, or whether brief or detail is the information presently own in the terminal in the program having the detail information. Accordingly, an identification signal for building up the database is superposed on the MSB wave. A similar signal is superposed at the broadband side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> At the terminal, preferably, a button for confirming whether the user desires more specific information or not should be provided. Or when receiving the MSB wave data again, in order to release the memory, a button inquiring whether or not to discard the detail data is provided, so that the convenience is further enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Further, complicated operation procedure can be omitted by configuring to replace with detail information fully automatically only by putting the terminal on the main unit (store dock). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when configured to replace all information of the terminal with the latest information when connected to the broadband (CS, Internet), the latest information can be viewed from the terminal whenever and wherever desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> By allowing to view by using the key word or terminal ID, when designed to manage and validate at the information center, an application is considered to permit downloading only at a specified terminal from next time as far as the information is the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> When the terminal has an agent function, the synopsis or full text of necessary information can be downloaded from the broadband on the basis of the user&apos;s preference information, or when the probability of preference database is enhanced by synchronizing the preference information with the main unit, it is more effective. </paragraph>
