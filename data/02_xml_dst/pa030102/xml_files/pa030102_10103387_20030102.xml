<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a screw-type jack mounted mainly on a vehicle such as an automobile, a truck, and so on and used when the vehicle is jacked up for repair and tire change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a screw-type jack for high lifting of a mid-load vehicle, a well-known jack called a potbellied jack is used. The potbellied jack has a hollow housing disposed to stand on a base. A cylindrical ram guide and ram are combined in the housing in a telescope style. Two screw shafts are screwed to each other in an axial direction inside the housing to be extendable/contractible in a vertical direction. Such a potbellied jack is described, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open Hei 7-196290. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A ram nut attached to a lower end portion of the ram is screwed onto the upper one of the two screw shafts. A bevel gear is fixed to a lower end portion of a lower screw shaft. A drive gear is engaged with the bevel gear. The drive gear is rotated from the outside by an operation handle to extend/contract the ram guide and the ram, whereby a vehicle mounting table disposed on an upper end of the ram is lifted or lowered, depending on the direction of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The housing of this conventional jack for automobile is formed in such a manner that one portion of a steel pipe expanded to a substantially conical pipe shape using a press. A portion adjacent to the expanded portion in the substantially conic pipe shape is drawn in a rectangular pipe shape. Consequently, forming these shapes using a press is complicated, difficult, and requires a lot of time and labor. Moreover, a forced strength is given to the housing at the time of forming. This method of forming often results in unacceptable shape errors and cracks in the material, which require rejection. Such rejection results in low productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, in the above-described conventional jack for automobile, a cylindrical shaft portion for fitting the drive gear therein is welded to a fitting hole disposed in a lower part of a side surface of the housing, and a lower end portion of the housing is welded to a base. This welding consumes a lot of time and labor, and thus increases the production cost. Besides the cost disadvantage, the possibility of insufficient strength resulting from poor welding remains a concern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the conventional jack for automobile, an outer circumferential surface of the housing is painted after assembly is finished, with the ram and the ram guide accommodated therein. This painting is complicated and requires a lot of time and labor. In addition, only the outer surface of the housing can be painted. The inside of the housing, other parts, and so on are left unpainted, and therefore, there exists concern about rust prevention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Poor painting easily happens since grease coated on the bevel gear melts out due to the exposure of the jack to a high-temperature condition before or during painting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The welding angle of the cylindrical shaft portion relative to the housing is not fixed. A shaft portion of the drive gear directly contacts an inner circumference of the cylindrical shaft portion. Consequently, the drive gear and the periphery of the cylindrical shaft portion in which the drive gear is disposed are given a forced strength to generate heat due to friction heat when the jack is repeatedly lifted and lowered in load tests of the jack. Therefore, there are problems that the life of peripheral parts is shortened, a handle operation requires increased labor, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The ram and the ram nut of the conventional jack for automobile are separate members fixed to each other by some means such as welding in order to lower production cost. However, since this welding work requires a lot of time and labor, elimination of this operation is considered as one item to be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to use the conventional jack for automobile and put its components in their accommodated state, an operation handle having a long grip is used. But there exists a problem that a lot of time is required for lifting and lowering the ram and the ram guide by this operation handle. Therefore, it has been demanded that some method be devised which can lift the ram and the ram guide quickly in a short time to an intended height when they are used and which can also return the ram and the ram guide to their original positions in a short time when they are accommodated after being used. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a screw-type jack for automobile which can solve the various problems described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to provide a screw-type jack housing that can be efficiently formed and assembled of a housing and in which streamlined production of the housing at low cost is achieved by eliminating complicated forming work and troublesome welding operations, for the housing, can realize easy and precise surface treatment such as rust prevention to lengthen life and enhance strength, and can realize smooth and easy operation by an operation handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a jack for automobile in which a method is devised for a fixing means of a ram and a ram nut to enable its production cost to be further lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a jack for automobile in which a method is devised to increase the lifting/lowering speed of a ram when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-described objects, in a screw-type jack for automobile comprising: a base; a hollow and integrated housing provided to stand on this base; a ram mounted in the center portion inside this housing in an axial direction to be extendable/contractible in a vertical direction; and a drive mechanism mounted in the housing, for extending/contracting this ram in the vertical direction, and in which the housing includes a cylindrical shaft portion protrudingly disposed on a lower part of a side surface of the housing, and a drive gear is pivotally and rotatably supported in this cylindrical shaft portion, the present invention defines the housing as constituted of a plurality of housing pieces, namely, vertically divided portions of the housing, wherein the housing pieces are mechanically joined to each other to form the housing. This structure makes it possible to realize easy and uniform forming of the housing by eliminating complicated and difficult forming; furthermore, to realize efficient forming and assembly and streamlined production of the housing at low cost by eliminating troublesome and high-cost welding; and moreover, to enable easy and precise surface treatment such as painting and plating of the housing pieces and so on, thereby lengthening their life and enhancing their strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which the housing is divided in the vertical direction along the axis position of the cylindrical shaft portion, so that forming of the housing pieces is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides two-divided portions of the cylindrical shaft portion integrally formed with the housing pieces, so that inefficiency of disposing the cylindrical shaft portion separately as in the conventional art is eliminated and streamlined production is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a housing that is divided into two pieces in the vertical direction. A pair of these housing pieces are formed symmetrically, so that the structure thereof is simplified and the production thereof is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a jack in which each of the housing pieces includes joining pieces along edge portions of the housing piece to extend from these edge portions. When the housing pieces are mechanically joined with each other to form one housing, the joining pieces of the housing pieces are fixed with each other by a rivet, so that welding of the housing pieces is eliminated to realize cost reduction of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which the housing piece includes: joining pieces along edge portions of each of the housing portions extend from these edge portions. A connecting piece extends from one or both of the joining pieces. When the housing pieces are mechanically joined with each other to form the housing, the connecting piece is folded to overlappingly fix the joining pieces with each other. In this structure, the housing pieces are fixed to each other by one press work without requiring welding, to further reduce cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which the housing includes a leg piece protruding from a lower end portion of the housing. The leg piece is fixed to the base by a rivet to eliminate welding, so that cost reduction is also realized here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a jack in which a bush or a bearing layer is interposed between an inner circumferential surface of the two-divided portions of the cylindrical shaft portion and a shaft portion of the drive gear, so that the drive gear can be rotated smoothly, labor necessary for driving operation is reduced, and heat generation in the periphery of the cylindrical shaft portion is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a screw-type jack for automobile comprising: a base; a hollow and integrated housing provided to stand on this base; a ram guide mounted in a center portion inside this housing in an axial direction to be extendable/contractible in a vertical direction; a ram mounted in the ram guide to be extendable/contractible; and a screw shaft for extending/contracting the ram guide and the ram in the vertical direction, and in which the housing includes a cylindrical shaft portion provided protrudingly on a lower part of a side surface of the housing, and a drive gear is pivotally and rotatably supported in this cylindrical shaft portion, the present invention a housing that is constituted of a plurality of housing pieces, namely, vertically divided portions of the housing and both side portions of these housing pieces are mechanically joined with each other to form the housing. This structure makes it possible to realize easy and uniform forming of the housing by eliminating complicated and difficult forming work; and furthermore, to realize efficient forming and assembly and streamlined production of the housing at low cost by eliminating troublesome and high-cost welding. Moreover, easy and precise surface treatment such as painting and plating of the housing pieces and so on is enabled, thereby lengthening their life and enhancing their strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which the ram is constituted of a cylindrical portion and a rum nut. A circumferential groove is formed around an outer circumference of an inserting portion of the ram nut which is to be inserted to the cylindrical portion. After the inserting portion is inserted into the cylindrical portion, an inner surface of the cylindrical portion is bulged out and fixed to the circumferential groove by caulking an outer circumferential portion of the cylindrical portion. Thereby, the ram nut is fixed to the cylindrical portion without welding to realize cost reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which a quick moving lever is added in order to move a ram quickly in a vertical direction. The quick moving lever is caught in a handle joint of a drive gear and rotates a handle joint with a small rotation radius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a jack in which a spacer ring is attached between a handle joint of an operation handle and an end portion of an outer surface of the cylindrical shaft portion. The handle joint is attached to the shaft portion of the drive gear to swing freely via a pin, so that backlash of the shaft portion in an axial direction is prevented and the handle joint is free to swing easily. </paragraph>

The ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is placed at the lowest position and the vehicle mounting table <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned directly above the upper end portion of the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this state, when the jack for automobile is to be used for jacking up a vehicle, the jack for automobile is positioned directly under a jack point of the vehicle, for example, a jack point around a tire housing, the end portion of the operation handle (not shown) is inserted in the fitting groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> thereof and the handle is rotated around an axis of a shaft. This operation rotates the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and, as a result, rotates the bevel bear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> engaged with the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, integral with the bevel gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is also rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> This causes the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to move upward along the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> via the female screw portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. When the upper end potion of the female screw portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> contacts the pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, in other words, when the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is extended to its full stroke, the upward movement of the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is stopped so that it rotates idly in this position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the idle rotation of the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> moves upward along the male screw portion of the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without rotating and the diameter-reducing portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is caught by the rain nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to move the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> upward. The upward movement of the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> causes the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> fixed to the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to move upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> At this time, the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is fitted in the inner surface of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is fitted in the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the moving posture thereof is stabilized. This state is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> moves upward, the vehicle mounting table <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fits in the jack point around the tire housing of the vehicle to jack up the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In this way, when the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved to the highest position of the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the upper end portion of the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is caught by the pin <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> so that its upward movement is restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At this time, the projections (not shown) on the lower end portion of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are caught by the catching portions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the upward moving position of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Then, the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is extended to its full stroke to cause the vehicle mounting table <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the upper end portion of the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to reach its highest position so that the periphery of the tire housing of the vehicle is jacked up to a predetermined height to enable a tire to be changed. This, extended state is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> After the jack for automobile is used, the operation handle is rotated n the reverse direction to cause the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the bevel gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to reversely rotate so that the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is reversely rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> This causes the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to rotate reversely and to move downward along the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> so that the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> move with it until the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are accommodated in the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As described above, in this embodiment, a drive means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> mounted in the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for vertically moving the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is composed of the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the bevel gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> engaged with the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> fixed to the bevel gear <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> screwed to the first screw shaft <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in an axial direction, and the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. However, the drive means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is not limited to this embodiment. Only one screw shaft may be used. When only one screw shaft is used, the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may sometimes be omitted. What is important is that any drive means may be used as long as it causes the ram to move vertically by rotating the drive gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which is pivotally and rotatably supported in the cylindrical shaft portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> After being accommodated, the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is positioned at the upper end portion of the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the upper end portion of the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when rotation of the operation handle is reversed, the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates idly in its accommodated position to cause the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to move downward along the second screw shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without rotating and the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> rotate with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> At this time, the ram nut <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is fitted in the inner surface of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is fitted in the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the moving posture thereof is stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> When the vehicle mounting table <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is moved away from the jack-up point of the vehicle and the ram <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the ram guide <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are returned to their original positions, the jack for automobile can be taken out from under the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the drive gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, when the jack for automobile is used, causes the periphery of the shaft portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to generate heat due to contact friction between the shaft portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. However, a flat and smooth contact surface of the bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> reduces the contact friction to reduce the heat generation, so that a normal usage state is maintained, and thereby, the life of the shaft portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is lengthened compared with a case when the shaft portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> directly contacts the inner surfaces of the short pipe pieces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be omitted when thin bearing layers made of metal or synthetic resin is coated on the respective inner surfaces of the short pipe pieces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in which the bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached and on the respective inner surfaces of the fitting stepped portions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in the above-described embodiment. In this case, the bearing layers may overlap the aforesaid surface treatment layers, or the beating layers may be directly coated without the surface treatment layers. The former case facilitates the forming of the bearing layers. The latter case enhances the fixability of the bearing layers, so that detachment and abrasion of the bearing layers due to the elapse of time can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The housing pieces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which are made of metal plates in the above-described embodiment, may be made of cast iron, by die-casting, or of synthetic resin. This makes it possible to form the housing pieces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> easily and at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> show another embodiment of the housing, in which a housing <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is made up of housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> consist of two vertically divided portions of the housing <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> as in the aforesaid embodiment. However, this embodiment is different from the aforesaid embodiment in that the forming method of the housing <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in which the housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are not joined to each other by rivets. Instead, joining pieces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of one housing piece <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> overlap joining pieces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the other housing piece <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. A plurality of connecting pieces <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> provided to further protrude from the joining pieces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are folded to catch the joining pieces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the other housing piece <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Thereby the housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are joined to each other, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> This structure makes it possible to join the housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with each other in one operation using a pressing machine, which offers the advantage of reduced cost, compared with a case when the housing pieces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are joined with each other by riveting using a plurality of rivets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The connecting pieces <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> maybe provided to all of the joining pieces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, or they may be provided only to portions joined by the rivets as described in he aforesaid embodiment. The connecting pieces <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> may be provided to the other connecting pieces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or may be provided alternately to the joining pieces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Moreover, joining by rivets may also be employed together with the use of joining pieces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> show a quick moving means of the ram. In the drawings, the quick moving means consists of a flexible synthetic resin quick moving lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> made of, for example, PE. The quick moving lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is composed of a grip portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a U-shaped cross section and resilient catching pieces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> protruding from the substantially central portion of the grip portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the resilient catching pieces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are inserted in a fitting groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the handle joint <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The resilient catching pieces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are resiliently urged outward to catch in the fitting groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The handle joint <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is attached to the shaft portion of the drive gear. The grip portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is gripped by a hand to rotate the handle joint <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which results in quick rotation of the not-shown drive gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> This operation rotates the drive gear more quickly than in a case when it is rotated using an operation handle since the rotation radius is small and is easily operated. Consequently, the ram guide and the ram can be lifted/lowered more quickly. After the vehicle mounting table contacts the jack point of the vehicle, it is necessary to use the operation handle to apply the increased torque needed to raise the vehicle. The quick moving lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> working as a quick moving means is also effective while returning the components to their original stowed positions after usage. A pair of catching projections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided on the inner surface of portions where the resilient catching pieces <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are formed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, these catching projections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are fitted in not-shown catching holes in the joining pieces or the connecting pieces of the housing. The quick moving lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is kept in this state when it is not used. Note that bulging portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed on one side deviated from the center portion of the grip portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> make the grip portion easy to grip during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> show a fixing means for the ram and the ram nut. A circumferential groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is formed in a fitting portion <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is inserted in the ram <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, of the ram nut <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. An outer circumferential portion of the ram <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> corresponding to this circumferential groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is caulked by pressure to cause an inner circumference of the ram <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to bulge inwardly and to be pushed into the circumferential groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the ram nut <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. This fixedly connects together the ram <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the ram nut <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. This structure brings about the advantage of reducing production cost compared with a case when the ram <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the ram nut <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are welded to be fixed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the reinforcing means of the leg pieces of each of the housing pieces. The reinforcing beads, which are provided in the aforesaid embodiment, are not included on leg pieces <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing pieces <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> constituting the housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Instead, a flange portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connect the leg pieces <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing piece <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and a flange portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connect the leg pieces <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the housing piece <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> denotes a base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This structure brings about an advantage that the reinforcing means can be formed more easily than in a case when the reinforcing beads are formed even though they are formed by press work in both cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of attaching a drive gear to a cylindrical shaft portion. A circumferential groove <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed in a portion of a shaft portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the drive gear <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. This portion matches the position of an end portion of an outer surface of the cylindrical shaft portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. A spacer ring <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is fitted in this circumferential groove <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to contact the end portion of the outer surface of the cylindrical shaft portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> This structure eliminates back blast of the shaft portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in an axial direction and enables a handle joint <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is attached to the shaft portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via a pin <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to swing freely, to swing more smoothly so that an advantage of improving operability of the operation handle is brought about. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
