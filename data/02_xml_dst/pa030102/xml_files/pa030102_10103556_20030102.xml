<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method to facilitate commerce over a computer network utilizing a prepaid account code. A potential consumer desiring to purchase goods or services over a computer network purchases the account code or card. To purchase goods or services, the consumer utilizes the card and a secret code at any seller web site, accessed via a computer network, such as the Internet. The seller web site verifies the validity and balance of the money card when the account code and secret code are utilized to purchase goods or services. Upon receiving authorization from the money card exchange, the seller executes the purchase and the money card exchange updates the money card balance in a database. In this manner the account code system facilitates commerce over a computer network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to network communications and database maintenance and in particular to a system to facilitate Internet commerce. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Advances in computer technology and communication technology allow for highspeed computer and communication networks. Simultaneous with the advances in the speed and capability of computer networks, other technological advances allow a large percentage of consumers to purchase access, in the form of computers and network service provider subscriptions, to these computer networks. While numerous computer networks exist, one of the most widely known networks is commonly referred to as the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide packet switched computer network having numerous Internet servers, routers and hubs, and can be accessed via personal computers. Numerous individuals throughout the world have access to the Internet via a direct connection or via an Internet service provider. Once connected to the Internet, and in particular, the World Wide Web (WWW), individuals may move from web site to web site to obtain information or download data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As commonly occurs in modem society, numerous businesses, sellers and retailers have moved to capitalize on this new trend. Business owners and managers have realized the potential of the Internet to increase sales of goods or services. Using the Internet, consumers can utilize their personal computer and Internet access to connect to a seller&apos;s web site and order goods and services. This frees the consumer from having to travel to and from the store, risk finding an item out of stock, and waiting in line to purchase goods or services. Hence, the age of Internet retail has emerged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To hasten the rush of Internet shoppers, sellers have established numerous methods and apparatus to accept payment from a consumer shopping via the Internet. These various methods include payment via credit card, bankcard, personal check or cash-on-delivery (COD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While it is possible to complete transactions using these methods, numerous drawbacks exist with regard to each payment option. In the case of credit card, bank card, and personal check payment systems, consumers are concerned that revealing confidential financial information over a computer network may result in the confidential information being compromised either by an unscrupulous seller or by an unknown computer hacker in search of credit card numbers, bank card numbers, or checking account information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another security issue arises when individuals or family members other than an individual in charge of finances are provided access to financial data, such as credit card numbers and the like. For example, if a child or worker desires to execute an Internet transaction, the financial data must be given to that person, which may result in excessive Internet purchasing or unauthorized use. Hence, individuals in charge of the financial data, such as a parent or financial department, may be reluctant to facilitate the Internet transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, individuals may not want to be identified with a particular transaction. Using a credit card, bank card or personal check, however, identifies the person executing payment and identifies the transaction, e.g. on a periodic statement or canceled check. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Many people may not qualify for credit cards or bankcards due to lack of income or previous credit problems. Because Internet transactions often depend on the using a credit card, such people may be excluded from Internet transactions because cash and checks are generally not accepted and may unreasonably hinder timely completion of the transaction. Additionally, COD payment options may be unacceptable to sellers because consumers often refuse to pay upon delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Finally, person-to-person fund transfers via telephone or the Internet suffer from many similar problems. Most person-to-person fund transfer systems require that the user or users have an email account and also a checking account or credit card. Therefore, person-to-person fund transfers generally create security risks and problems with maintaining anonymity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although other methods and apparatus have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks, none have adequately met the existing needs of consumers and retailers. For at least one reason, the other proposed payment methods fail in some respect. For example, many proposed solutions are too complicated in that they require consumers to perform numerous additional steps, actions or application processes. Other proposed solutions do not provide adequate security or anonymity, while other solutions are simply too expensive due to numerous third parties that must be involved to facilitate the transaction. Accordingly, improved systems and methods for paying for online transactions would be useful. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a transaction system is provided to facilitate consumer transactions over a computer network. The present invention facilities Internet commerce by enabling a consumer to purchase goods and services over the Internet without having to use cash, checks, credit cards, or bank cards. In one embodiment, account codes are utilized. The account codes may be imprinted on cards or any other structure or surface or transmitted to the consumer via a network. Consumers access these account codes in any number of ways by paying for such account codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Each account code identifies an account that has a monetary balance associated with the account. In one embodiment a single oversight entity oversees the creation and accounting for each account code. This entity oversees the creation of these account codes, maintains records of the account codes with associated balances and serves as a monetary exchange for payments between account code purchasers and sellers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To realize the advantages of the present invention, an individual, such as an Internet consumer may purchase the account code from a code retailer. Having obtained an account code, the consumer may utilize the account code at one or more Internet web sites that accept the account code system as a form of payment to obtain products, e.g., goods or services. By providing the account code to the web site of the seller, the consumer may authorize a transfer from the balance associated with the account to the seller as payment. In this manner, the Internet seller is compensated for the products sold or otherwise provided to the consumer. The balance associated with the account may be updated to reflect the purchase, e.g., by subtracting the amount of the purchase from the balance. After the seller receives payment from the code entity, the seller may send or otherwise provide the products to the consumer. It is anticipated that this process may occur rapidly over one or more computer networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, additional security features of the card may be introduced. The card may contain printed information such as a card number, an expiration date (if any), a fictitious first name, and a control number. When the consumer purchases the card or account code, the consumer may be given a card activation code generated by a random character generator. To activate the card, the consumer may access a card management web site and input information required to activate the card, e.g. the card activation code. Once the card management web site has verified this information to be valid, the web site may require the consumer to input a secret code that may be associated with the account code. After designating the secret code, the card cannot be used to transfer funds without inputting the secret code. Thus, only the consumer, not a third party who is not privy to the secret code, may use the card to make purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The card system may also allow for person-to-person fund transfers. For example, a seller selling an item to a buyer may give the buyer certain information regarding their account code that would allow the buyer to transfer funds from the buyer&apos;s own account code or from another account such as a credit card or checking account. This transaction may be completed online or via a telephonic transfer system. Transactions in this form are not limited to buyer/seller transactions and may be used to transfer funds in a manner similar to wire transfers. For example, a parent may wire money to a child in order to add value to the child&apos;s account code. In addition, this method may be used to combine the value of two or more accounts held by the same person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for managing a plurality of pre-paid money cards that includes an account database including account codes identifying respective accounts, account balances identifying funds available funds from respective accounts, and account activation codes associated with the respective accounts. An interface may be configured for receiving an account code and an account activation code from a consumer over a telecommunications network. An account manager may be coupled to the interface for accessing the account database to confirm that the received account activation code is associated with the received account code. The account manage may request a secret code via the interface from the consumer over the telecommunications network after the account manager has confirmed that the received account activation code is associated with the received account code, the account manager configured for adding the secret code received from the consumer to the account database such that the secret code is uniquely associated with the respective account code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the interface may be configured for receiving an authorization request comprising a fund request, an account code, and a secret code. Preferably, the authorization request excludes information personally identifying the consumer. The account manager may access the account database to confirm that the secret code is associated with the account code, and/or to confirm that the fund request does not exceed a balance of the account identified by the account code. A transfer system may be provided for transferring funds from the account after the account manager has confirmed that the fund request does not exceed the balance of the account identified by the account code. The account manager may deduct the fund request from the balance in the account database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for anonymously transferring funds using pre-paid money cards that includes an account database including account codes identifying respective accounts, account balances identifying available funds associated with respective accounts, and authorization codes associated with respective accounts. An interface is provided for receiving an account code and an authorization code from a consumer or seller over a telecommunications network. An account manager is coupled to the interface for accessing the account database to confirm that the received authorization code is associated with the received account code. The account manager may be configured for transferring funds from the account after the account manager has confirmed that the fund request does not exceed a balance of the account identified by the account code, the account manager deducting the fund request from the balance in the account database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for securely transferring funds using an account database including a plurality of account codes and card activation codes, the account codes identifying accounts including respective account balances identifying available funds, the card activation codes uniquely associated with respective account codes. The account codes and associated card activation codes may be provided to one or more distributors or consumers. An account code and a card activation code may be received from a seller, distributor, or consumer via a telecommunications network. The account database may be accessed to confirm that the received card activation code is uniquely associated with the received account code. A secret code may be requested from the consumer via the telecommunications network, received from the consumer, and stored in the account database such that the secret code is associated with the account code. For example, the secret code may replace the card activation code, thereby providing an authorization code required for subsequent use of the account code. Thereafter, secured transactions may be permitted using the account code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for securely transferring funds that includes purchasing or otherwise receiving an account code, the account code including an account balance and a card activation code associated therewith. The account code and the activation code may be sent via a telecommunications network, e.g., over the Internet, to an account manager to activate the account code. A query may be received from the account manager to provide a secret code to be associated with the account code after the account manager has activated the account code, whereupon a secret code may be sent to the account manager via the telecommunications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for a seller to sell products to a purchaser via a network. A prepaid account code and a secret code may be received from a purchaser, e.g., when the purchaser visits one or more web sites operated by the seller, the prepaid account code not identifying the purchaser. The seller may verify that the prepaid account code and secret code are valid, e.g., by initiating a database look-up to determine whether the prepaid account code and the secret code are valid. For example, the seller&apos;s server may transmit the prepaid account code and the secret code to an account manager, such as that described above, via a telecommunications network, e.g., the Internet. The account manager may then perform the confirmations described above, and provide the verification to the seller. The seller may receive payment for the products from a balance associated with the prepaid account code, e.g., from the account manager after the account manager has verified that an account balance associated with the prepaid account code is sufficient to pay for the products being purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for securely transferring funds using a prepaid account code, the prepaid account code including an account balance and an authorization code associated therewith. A transaction request may be received, e.g., by an account manager via a telecommunications network, e.g., directly from a consumer or from a seller. The transaction request may include a value, a prepaid account code, an authorization code, and a destination, and preferably excludes any information identifying the consumer. The account manager may confirm that the authorization code is associated with the prepaid account code, and/or that the value does not exceed the account balance associated with the prepaid account code. Once confirmed, the value may be debited from the account balance associated with the prepaid account code, and the value may be transferred to the destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the destination may be a different prepaid account code, and the value may be transferred to the different prepaid account code via the telecommunications network. Alternatively, the transaction request may be received from a vender, and the destination may be a vender account associated with the vender. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention may allow a consumer to shop on the Internet for products, e.g., goods and/or services, while still maintaining secrecy as to their identity. Further, the account code may be purchased with cash by an individual who does not qualify for a credit card or checking account. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from consideration of the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 1. Overview of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved systems and methods for facilitating the purchase of goods or services and the transfer of funds over a computer network. As recited above, purchasing goods over a computer network, such as the Internet, is growing. The present invention facilities Internet commerce by providing systems and methods for a consumer to purchase using prepaid cards. As used herein, a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; may include an individual or an institution, such as a business. Each card includes one or more account codes that identify an account and a balance of that account. The account code may be associated with or imprinted on a card or paper, or transmitted via the network itself. The characters of the account code can comprise letters and/or numbers. In one embodiment, a single oversight entity oversees the creation and accounting for each account code. For purposes of understanding, this oversight entity is referred to herein as a money card exchange. The money card exchange oversees the creation of these account codes, maintains records of the accounts with associated balances and serves as a monetary exchange for payments between consumers and sellers. In a preferred embodiment, the consumer is able to add value to the account. Person-to-person transfers to and/or from an account code are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to realize the advantages of the present invention, a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> purchases an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from any of a number of various convenient locations, referred to herein as a code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. It is anticipated that a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> might purchase an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a market, convenience store, or computer store. A consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may also purchase an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the telephone or a network, such as the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, in exchange for a fifty dollar card having an account code balance of fifty dollars, a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would pay the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in any acceptable form, such as cash, credit card, bank card, checking account number and routing number, account code, check, or COD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Having obtained an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may utilize an account identified by the account code at any of a number of seller web sites <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to pay for goods or services from a seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. By providing the account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> facilitates a transfer of payment from the account to the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> maintains the account and account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ensures payment from the account to the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> maintains and updates the available balance associated with each account. In this manner, the account may be used one or more times until the balance in the account is depleted. Once the account balance is zero, the account is closed unless the card is refueled, and the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may no longer obtain goods or services using that particular account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The balance of several accounts can be consolidated into a single account if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Additional details regarding using the account code system and the systems that enable such use are described below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 2. Exemplary Environment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> One exemplary environment particularly well suited for using a code system of the present invention is the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As is commonly known in the art, the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a world-wide network of computers configured to exchange, store and display information. Located on storage media of the computers that comprise the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are data and code to display information, such as web pages, to individuals having access to the Internet. Internet access, i.e. getting &ldquo;on-line,&rdquo; is most commonly provided via an Internet service provider, such as America-On-Line or Earthlink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Sellers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> maintain numerous web pages on the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in an effort to sell goods and services. These web pages include interactive software to facilitate payment for goods purchased by consumers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> block diagram of the various aspects of the present invention are shown. A money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is responsible for establishing account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which in at least one embodiment, are imprinted on cards. The money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> maintains a database of account code numbers with associated accounts and balances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicates with a code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can comprise a convenience store, retail store, vending machine, or an on-line vendor. Alternatively, account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be purchased via mail order or by telephone. The money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sells large numbers of money cards, i.e. account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or cards imprinted with account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Hence, account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are exchanged for payment to the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> either at time of sale to the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or after the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> sells the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in-turn sells the cards having account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> associated therewith to individual consumers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> pays the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> an amount equal to, greater than, or less than the denomination of the card, i.e. the balance of the account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The card may be activated when sold to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or may require the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to activate the card before usage. In a preferred embodiment and as further discussed below, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> activates the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by accessing a card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and entering information regarding the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> communicates with the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the network. Once the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> verifies the accuracy of the account code information, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> activates the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> activates the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may access a web site, such as a seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, to utilize the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to purchase goods or services. The seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes software capable of accepting the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to pay for goods or services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Upon purchasing goods or services at a seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> communicates with the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In response, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> pays the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provides the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with the goods or services. In this manner, the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives payment for the goods and services. The money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> automatically deducts the purchase price from the balance of the account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> top plan view of an exemplary card <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is shown. As shown, the card <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that may be utilized to obtain goods and services. The account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may either be printed or imprinted on the face of the card. The card may also include a denomination or value <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> representing how much the card costs or is worth. In alternative embodiments, some form of advertising logo <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> may reside at the top of the card and instructions or an Internet web site address <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may also reside on the money card <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Various other embodiments of the present invention place the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on items other than a card. For example, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be purchased via an on-line service and delivered to the purchaser in an encrypted digital format. In other embodiments, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be placed on other items including but not limited to paper, e-mail, telegrams, phone messages, or any promotional items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, the card identifying the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include additional security features. These additional security features not only enhance the anonymity of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, but may also prevent fraudulent use of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by an unauthorized person. In a preferred embodiment, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be provided to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on a card identifying a magnetic strip. Stored on the magnetic strip may be information such as the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, card number, expiration date (if any), transfer code (discussed further below), card activation code from a random character generator (discussed further below), a control number, a fictitious first name, etc. All or any part of the information stored on the magnetic strip may also be reproduced on the card itself. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> presents several categories into which cards are grouped depending on the features of the cards. While all cards and the associated network configured in accordance with the present invention share a basic method of operation, different types of cards can exist. One type of cards comprises generic cards <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A generic card is a basic card that can be used at any Internet web site that accepts the card as a method of payment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Another type of card can comprise a seller specific card <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. A seller specific card <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> differs from a generic card <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in that it must be used at a specific seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Another type of card comprises a promotional card <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. A promotional card <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> comprises a card specifically associated with one or more other promotions or incentives to utilize the card at a particular site or for a particular type of product or service. The card may be without cash value and be promotional only (like a coupon). For example, in some cases cards can be distributed via magazines, direct mail or handouts. Non-promotional cards can also be distributed via magazines, direct mail or handouts. The recipient may take a promotional card into an approved retailer, like Wal-Mart or Blockbuster, to add value to the balance of the account. The recipient may simply hand over cash and the card to a person at the retailer. The retailer may enter the account code, e.g. by swiping a magnetic strip on the card into a credit/debit card reader machine and entering the amount the person gave them (i.e. $25, $50, $500 etc.) into the cash register/reader. The transaction may be transmitted through the retailer&apos;s system to the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which completes the transaction and gives the account value. The recipient then can go to any web site that accepts the card and use it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate the organization and content of the database records and sub-records of one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

For every sale of account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a block sales ID <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is used to identify which account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> were sold to a code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A code retailer ID <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> stores a numeric code that uniquely identifies the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to which the account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> were sold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A card sales ID range <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> identifies the range of account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that were sold in the card transaction identified by the unique block sales ID <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A sales date field <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and a card shipment status field <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> store data regarding the date of sale and shipping information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> This manner of data is utilized by the card system during operation. The functionality and importance of the various types of data are discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that various methods of operation may be adopted in conjunction with the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates one exemplary method for establishing and utilizing one embodiment of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to the method illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> as various other methods and systems may be used to implement the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, cards are manufactured by the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the cards are sold to code retailers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As remuneration for the sale of the cards, the code retailers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> transfer funds to the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or remuneration may not occur until sale to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) or upon periodic processing. For example, the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may send remuneration to the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> based on sales of the cards to consumers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for a given month or quarter. In various other embodiments, the present invention may utilize items other than cards on which to distribute the account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the account codes are delivered electronically or printed on paper, other promotional devices or sent via fax or phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, consumers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> desiring to use the cards pay code retailers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that such purchases may occur via a computer network, via telephone, or in-person at the site of the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is automatically active at the time of sale or transfer to the code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is activated at the time the card is first used to purchase goods or services at a retailer or seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, it is contemplated that an independent step of activation can be utilized. If activation of the card is required, at step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> utilizes a connection with a computer network or a telephone to activate the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the card database. Accordingly, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> accesses a card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and provides the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and/or other information on the card. The card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> then communicates with the database of the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the computer network. The money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> verifies that the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is valid and activates the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Upon activation, the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to purchase goods or services from any retailer or seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> accepting the account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a form of payment. If activation of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not required, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may proceed directly to step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> accesses a seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> selects goods to purchase. At step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, the consumer enters account code information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the seller web site and/or the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> process any promotions associated with the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or the purchase of goods or services being obtained with the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, discussed below, discusses one exemplary method of promotion processing in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> determines if the balance of the account is sufficient to complete the purchase. To determine if the balance of the account is sufficient, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> interrogates the card database to obtain balance information. If the balance is not sufficient to complete the purchase, the process progresses to step <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, wherein other forms of payment may be utilized to supplement payment. In various other embodiments, other payment methods that may be utilized include but are not limited to additional account codes, credit cards, bank cards or direct bill procedures. At step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may enter information for another account. After entering this additional account information, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to determine whether the consumer&apos;s balance is now sufficient. If adequate payment cannot be provided, the operation terminates the purchase at step <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> If a sufficient balance is available from the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or if additional forms of payment have adequately supplemented the payment, the operation progresses to step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> wherein the approval of the purchase is sent from the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> so the purchase may be completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the balance of the account is updated at step <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, and the appropriate amount of money is sent from the account to the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in exchange for the goods or services. The consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can then access another seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to make an additional purchase or exit the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> This is but one of many methods of operation for the establishment of cards, purchase of account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, use of account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and verification process during account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> use. It is contemplated that those of ordinary skill in the art will envision other methods of use or variations on the described method of use, all of which are covered by the scope of the claims below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates an operational flow diagram of an exemplary method of operation of the present invention from the standpoint of a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. At a step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> obtains a card. It is contemplated that the card may be obtained in any number of ways, for example, as a purchase, gift, prize or free promotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Once the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has obtained the card, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be given an account activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generated by a random character generator. In an exemplary embodiment, the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a fictitious last name generated by a random character generator. This code may be provided to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in several manners, for example, a sticker attached to the card. After the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has used the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to activate the card as described below, the sticker may be removed from the card and/or otherwise destroyed. In addition, the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be printed on the card itself. In a preferred embodiment, the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided to the consumer on the consumer&apos;s receipt for purchasing the card. The card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provides an additional security feature for the card by requiring that the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> enter this code in order to activate the card. As further discussed below, once the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has entered the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g. at a card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the consumer may be prompted by the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to enter a secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that becomes associated thereafter with the account, and may be required to initiate subsequent transactions utilizing the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> If the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> loses the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or forgets the secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a support system may be provided to reset either code. For example, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may call a telephone support center and provide the support center representative with information such as the date and location of purchase, method of payment, account number used to purchase the card, transaction history of the card, etc. Upon verification, the support center representative may reset the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and/or the secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, for a consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> intending to utilize the card over a computer network, such as the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at step <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> accesses the network. At step <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may access a card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> enters the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for the card and transmits the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may enter information in addition to the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or in place of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such as a card number, a portion of a card number, an initial balance of the card, purchase date, a fictitious first name, and/or any combination of this information. At step <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be prompted by the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to provide a secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that may replace the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, once the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has chosen and entered the secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the card activation code <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may no longer be needed. The secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may provide security to limit an unauthorized person from utilizing the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may be a central web site for consumer management of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Besides allowing the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to activate the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may allow the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to check the account balance or transaction history, change the secret code <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, transfer funds to or from the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, set or change an email address associated with the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, activate the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for ATM access, etc. In a further embodiment, the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may provide a lock-out feature to prevent the card from being used at certain seller web sites, such as adult web sites. Additionally, the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may provide a purchase limitation feature allowing the account holder to impose limitations on the amount spent from the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on a daily, weekly, monthly, or other periodic basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> After activating the card, at step <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> accesses a desired seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to purchase goods or services. At the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> selects goods or services. Upon selecting the goods or services, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is prompted to enter payment information. If the card is an accepted form of payment, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> selects the card as the desired payment method and enters the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> records the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and/or forwards data to the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including but not limited to the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, seller ID code <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, and the purchase price of the item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> At a decision step <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> determines whether the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> presented are valid. If the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> combination is not valid, at step <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> informs the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is invalid. The consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may then be able to reenter the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and/or secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are determined to be valid, the method progresses to a decision step <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to determine if the card or purchase has an associated promotion. If at decision step <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, the method determines that there is a promotion associated with the transaction, the method progresses to a step <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> to execute a promotions sub-routine. The promotion sub-routine step <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is discussed in more detail below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Upon completing the promotion sub-routine or if there is no promotion associated with the transaction, the method progresses to a decision step <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> wherein the balance of the account associated with the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is compared to the amount of the purchase. If the balance is not adequate to cover the purchase, then the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> prompts the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> concerning the deficiency. In various embodiments, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may then reconfigure his purchase such that the amount of the purchase is within the balance and/or some other form of payment may be used to supplement the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that these supplemental forms of payment may include additional prepaid cards, credit cards, checks, bank cards, personal checks, purchase order numbers, or send-a-bill requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Once the balance (and other payment forms) is sufficient to pay for the purchase, at step <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> transmits a purchase authorization code <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The purchase authorization code <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> indicates to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a valid payment method. In various configurations, additional other information is sent to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> such as the purchase price after promotions, a code associated with the good or service, date of purchase, the seller security code and any other information required by the seller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to be able to process the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> At a step <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> deducts the purchase price from the balance of the card. This preferably occurs only after the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has received instructions that the transaction is complete. Alternatively, step <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously with authorization transmission (step <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>) to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>, a process is initiated to provide the purchased goods or services to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This may comprise, but is not limited to, shipping the goods, ordering the goods to be made, or providing a product authorization code to the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to obtain the goods or services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>, the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is queried whether he wants to make another purchase. If the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> chooses to make another purchase, the method returns to step <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. If the consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> chooses not to make another purchase, the method terminates at end step <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>. The consumer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is then free to exit from the computer network or go to another computer network site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates an operational flow diagram of an exemplary method of operation of a promotions sub-routine. The promotions sub-routine is designated generally at step <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. After determining that a promotion is associated with a purchase, as shown in step <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, promotion data is obtained that is associated with the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, secret code <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or proposed purchase from the card database. Promotion data may include but is not limited to data regarding the type of promotion, such as percentage discount, free gift with purchase, award of purchase coupons or award points, or cash back award. The promotion data may also comprise data regarding the start date and expiration date of the promotion, the sponsor of the promotion or contact information regarding the promotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>, the effect of the promotion on the purchase is calculated. The effect of the promotion may comprise a percentage discount or some other form of adjustment to the purchase price. Next, at step <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>, the promotion is applied to the price of the purchase or some other aspect of the purchase. This price or transaction summary is utilized for the basis of the purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Next, at step <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>, the promotion data and associated transaction are recorded in the database of the money card exchange <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, at step <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight>, the promotion data and adjustment in transaction price are included in the authorization data that is to be sent to the seller web site <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The promotions sub-routine operation then returns to the operation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> at a step <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the account code system also allows for person-to-person fund transfers. Person-to-person transfers may take place in a variety of environments, such as transfers from a buyer to a seller or from a parent to a child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A user intending to make a transfer of funds to or from an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may go to a code retailer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, access the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or complete the transfer over the phone. In order to have funds transferred into an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the account code holder may give the user (1) a transfer code and (2) an account code identifier. In a preferred embodiment, the transfer code only allows another party to transfer funds into the account. The account code identifier may comprise all or a portion of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or another form of identification of the account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other forms of account code identifiers may be a fictitious first name, secondary card number, email address of the account code holder, etc. The account code identifier may also be any combination of the listed items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The user may then input these numbers into the chosen transfer medium. For example, if the user accessed the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the user may select an option allowing for a transfer of funds. The user may then be prompted to enter the transfer code, the account code identifier, and the amount to be transferred. In addition, the user may be prompted to provide information regarding the user&apos;s account from which the funds are to be withdrawn and subsequently transferred to the account code holder&apos;s account. The user may use any form of account such as an account code <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a checking account, credit card, bank card, or cash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Funds may be transferred by telephone in a similar manner with the user dialing an established fund transfer phone number. The phone transfer system may then prompt the user for the relevant information in order to complete the transfer. If the user chooses to complete the transfer at a code retailer or other brick and mortar establishment, the user may provide the funds for the transfer in cash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, person-to-person transfers may involve private commerce via the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, auction web sites, such as EBAY.com, may allow sellers to accept fund transfers to the seller&apos;s account code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates one exemplary method of person-to-person transfers utilizing the present invention. At step <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the buyer selects a good being sold by the seller. For example, the buyer may be the winning bidder on an auction web site. Once the winning bidder has been determined, the seller may provide the bidder with the seller&apos;s transfer code and account code identifier at step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The buyer may then, at step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, access a web site, e.g., the card management web site <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or another web site configured to allow transfers to or from account codes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, the buyer may be prompted to enter information regarding the seller&apos;s account code. At step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, the buyer may then enter information regarding the buyer&apos;s account.
