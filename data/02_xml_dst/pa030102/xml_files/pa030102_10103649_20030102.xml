<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a concrete plant. More particularly, the present invention relates to a portable concrete plant. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Concrete is used in constructing a variety of different structures such as buildings, bridges and roads. Typically concrete is prepared in the form of ready mix concrete at a central location and then transported via truck to a location where the ready mix concrete is to be used. While this technique allows larger batches of ready mix concrete to be produced, the quality of concrete varies significantly depending on the distance between location where the ready mix concrete is prepared and the location where the ready mix concrete is used as the ready mix concrete begins the curing process as soon as it is prepared. As such, it is often necessary to add components to the ready mix concrete that either slows or speeds the curing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to overcome the drawbacks associated with producing ready mix concrete at a central location and then trucking the ready mix concrete to the use locations, it has been proposed to create a concrete plant that is portable such that the portable concrete plant may be transported to a location that is proximate where the ready mix concrete will be used. For example, Flood, U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,523, describes a portable concrete plant that is mounted on a single vehicle. The Flood portable concrete plant includes hoppers for storing rock, sand, cement and water. The Flood portable concrete plant also has a conveyor system that conveys the rock, sand and cement into a rotating drum where the components are mixed with water to prepare ready mix concrete. A pump is used for dispensing the ready mix concrete from the rotating drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Weisbrod, U.S. Pat. No. 4,298,288, discloses a portable concrete apparatus that is suited for preparing ready mix concrete proximate to a location where the concrete is to be used. The Weisbrod apparatus feeds rock, sand, cement and water at different locations along a mixing auger. Once sufficiently mixed, the ready mix concrete is pumped through a hose to the location where it is used. The Weisbrod system is particularly suited for use with preparing relatively small amounts of ready mix concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One of the important components of a system that prepares ready mix concrete is the slurry mixer that mixes water, cement and other components into a slurry, which then can be mixed with rock and sand to produce the ready mix concrete. Brown et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,588,299, and Strehlow, U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,457, each disclose a slurry mixer having a horizontally oriented mixing region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Milek, U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,112, discloses a slurry batch mixer that has an elongated configuration. The slurry batch mixer has a trough with a curved bottom. A ribbon type screw conveyor is mounted in the trough parallel to an axis of the trough. Rotation of the screw conveyor not only mixes the components together but also conveys the mixed components to a discharge port of the trough. Williams, U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,508, discloses a self-cleaning slurry mixer having a cylindrical shape with a feed screw extending therethrough to mix together the components and to convey the mixed slurry to the slurry outlet. Macauley et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,448, describes a twin screw slurry mixer where the screws are oriented parallel to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Hood, U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,240, describes a tank-type slurry mixer that has two sets of paddles rotatably mounted therein. The paddles cause the mixture to be drawn in the downward direction and then flow upwardly along the side walls of the tank. Brown, U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,031, also discloses a tank-type slurry mixer. None of the prior art references or discloses a portable concrete plant that is suitable for producing ready mix concrete at rates of between 75 and 200 cubic yards per hour as is typically required for commercial applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accurately controlling the flow of rock and sand also plays an important role in preparing ready mix concrete with consistent characteristics. Bush, U.S. Pat. No. 4,976,378, describes a paddle-type feed metering system. The Bush device includes four paddles that are rotatably mounted in an enclosure. Rotation of the paddle dispenses a predetermined weight of material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a portable concrete plant, as most clearly illustrated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of producing between about 75 and 200 cubic yards of ready mix concrete per hour. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is suited for use proximate a location where the ready mix concrete is to be used. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby reduces the cost of transporting the ready mix concrete to the location where the concrete is to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also enhances the quality of the concrete by eliminating wet or dry loads that are caused by variations in delivery time to the location where the ready mix concrete is to be used. By reducing these variations, qualities of the finished concrete such as strength are enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is possible to use the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a variety of locations with only minimal preparations to the locations, such as providing a relatively flat and stable surface. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a relatively low center of gravity, which makes the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stable to use on a variety of ground surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a material storage region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a material mixing region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a mixed material delivery region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that are each mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably fabricated to extend around the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed to maintain the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a fixed position not only during use of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but also during transportation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a location where the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably selected with a width, length and height that permit the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to meet substantially all of the applicable road size regulations such that the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be transported over a significant percentage of the roads without obtaining special permits. For most applications, the width is less than about 102 inches, the length is less than about 61 feet, and the height is less than about 13 feet 6 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably includes a gooseneck <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that facilitates attaching the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a truck for transporting the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a desired use location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supported by at least one set of wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that permit the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be easily transported to a desired use location. The number of sets of wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the number of wheels in each set of wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is selected based upon the applicable weight limitations. For most applications, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has two sets of wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that include two wheels on each side of the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Sides of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably covered by tarps (not shown) that protect the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during cold weather operations and facilitate heating of the components to prevent freezing of the materials in the portable concrete plant. The tarps also protect the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during transportation or while not in use. A heat exchanger (not shown) may be positioned underneath the tarp to heat the materials used in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during cold weather to prevent freezing of materials used in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The tarps are preferably retractable to a relatively small region proximate the top of the frame when the tarps are not in use to provide access to the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of materials are suitable for use in fabricating the tarp. A person of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that a variety of mechanisms are suitable for either automatically or manually moving the tarps from an extended position to the retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The material storage region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably has a separate storage area for each of the materials that are used for preparing the ready mix concrete, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. The material storage region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably includes a portland cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a rock storage region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a water storage region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The material storage region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also include storage regions for one or more admixes that are added during the concrete preparation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the present invention only illustrates the use of two rock storage regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that it is possible to utilize the concepts of the present invention in conjunction with multiple sizes of rock that are each stored separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a substantially enclosed upper end and a tapered lower portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a capacity of greater than 50 cubic feet, preferably between 100 cubic feet and 200 cubic feet and most preferably about 150 cubic feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Proximate the lower portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that controls the flow of cement from the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes two flow control mechanisms <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Using the two flow control mechanisms <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> enhances the ability to accurately control the rate at which cement is dispensed from the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Using two flow control mechanisms <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> also enhances the even loading of a paddle system in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and thereby reduces large torque differentials that can lead to potential damage of the components in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Using the two flow control mechanisms <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> also enhances the ability to rapidly load the cement into the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In particular, approximately 5,640 pounds of cement, which is needed for preparing 10 yards of ready mix concrete in a 6 bag mix protocol, is loaded into the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in less than 30 seconds and preferably about 15 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably includes a rotatably mounted gate valve. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other valve mechanisms may be used to control the flow of cement from the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Operation of the flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled by operable attachment to a hydraulic system in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is described in more detail herein. Alternatively, it is possible to control the operation of the flow control mechanism using an electrical or pneumatic control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using a load cell <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that permits the weight of cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be monitored on a continuous basis. Continuous monitoring of the weight of the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enhances the ability to accurately add cement during the concrete preparation process. Such a system is typically referred to as a loss in weight charge system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To enhance the ability to produce a steady flow of cement from the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably includes a vibrator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> operably attached thereto. To minimize the noise associated with the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as well as the wear and tear on the components of the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is preferably only activated while the flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A dust collection system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably provided on the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to collect dust that is generated by moving the cement into and out of the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The dust collection system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a series of filter cartridges (not shown) on which the dust is collected. The total surface area provided by the filter cartridges is between 500 and 2000 square feet and preferably about 1000 square feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At selected intervals the dust is removed from the filter cartridges. Since the filter cartridges are mounted above the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the dust falls into the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when it is removed from the filter cartridges. This recycling system minimizes the amount of cement dust that must be disposed of and extends the life of the filter cartridges. The dust collection system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a port (not shown) that provides operators with the ability to inspect the filter cartridges to determine when it is necessary to replace the filter cartridges. The port also provides the ability to easily access the filter cartridges when it is necessary to replace the filter cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Cement is preferably supplied to the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from an auxiliary bulk cement storage tanker (not shown) that is operably connected to the cement storage region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a cement transfer line (not shown). The auxiliary bulk cement storage tanker is operably connected to the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using hydraulically operated control valves that permit the flow of cement to be controlled from a control room on the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Transfer of the cement from the auxiliary bulk cement storage tanks is preferably performed using conventionally known techniques such as with blowing air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a substantially open upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that tapers down to a lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably has a storage capacity of approximately seven cubic yards. The substantially open upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> permits sand to be replenished into the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Proximate the lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that controls the flow of sand from the sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is preferably a paddle metering valve <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> such as is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. The paddle metering valve <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> reduces material bridging in the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and provides the ability to individually control the rates at which the materials are dispensed from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The paddle metering valve <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> generally includes two elements the rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the gate element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a plurality of paddles <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. The rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is oriented to rotate parallel to the direction in which the sand is falling out of the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The gate element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is pivotable between a closed position oriented adjacent to the rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and an open position. When in the closed position the rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the gate element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> substantially prevent flow of sand from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the gate element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> pivots from the closed position to the open position as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the sand is permitted to flow from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> thereby enhances the ability to produce an even sand flow rate. Changing the rate at which the rotatable paddle element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is rotated allows the sand flow rate to be changed. Positioning the gate element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> at intermediate positions between the open position and the closed position also permits the sand flow rate to be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using a load cell <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> that permits the weight of sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be monitored on a continuous basis. Continuous monitoring of the weight of the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> enhances the ability to accurately add sand during the concrete preparation process. Continuous monitoring of the weight of sand in the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also provides the operator with an indication as to when it is necessary to replenish the sand in the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To enhance the ability to produce a steady flow of sand from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably includes a vibrator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> operably attached thereto. To minimize the noise associated with the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as well as the wear and tear on the components of the sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is preferably only activated while the flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is operating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The rock storage region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a substantially open upper portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that tapers down to a lower portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably has a storage capacity of approximately seven cubic yards. The substantially open upper portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> permits rock to be replenished into the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>.

The flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> preferably includes a pair of gates that are pivotally mounted proximate the lower portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Pivoting of the gates to a closed position prevents rock from flowing out of the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Pivoting of the gates to an open position permits rock to flow out of the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Pivoting of the gates between the open position and the closed position is preferably controlled by a hydraulic cylinder (not shown). The metering valve preferably includes a flow control that permits slow opening of the valve to promote controlled free fall and rapid closing of the valve to promote accurately attaining the target material weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using a load cell <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that permits the weight of the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be obtained on a continuous basis. Continuous monitoring of the weight of the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> enhances the ability to accurately add rock during the concrete preparation process. Continuous monitoring of the weight of rock in the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also provides the operator with an indication as to when it is necessary to replenish the rock in the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> To enhance the ability to produce a steady flow of rock from the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the rock storage region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably includes a vibrator <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> operably attached thereto. To minimize the noise associated with the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> as well as the wear and tear on the components of the rock storage region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the bin vibrator <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is preferably only activated while the flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The water storage region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a substantially enclosed vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a capacity of between about 100 gallons and 500 gallons. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a weight cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that attaches the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The weight cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> permits the weight of the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be continuously monitored to accurately control the delivery of water in the cement preparation process. The weight cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also provides the operator with an indication when it is necessary to refill the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to manually monitoring the water level in the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the water level may be automatically controlled to refill the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from a water source. Depending on the location where the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used, the water source is typically either a tanker filled with water or attachment to a municipal water supply such as through a fire hydrant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The material mixing region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having a generally cylindrical shape with a side wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a base wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that encloses a lower end of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as most clearly illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is movable between an extended position (illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a storage position (illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). When in the storage position, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a height that permits the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be transported over most roads. When in the extended position, an exit port from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is sufficiently high to permit slurry to be delivered from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to a conventional concrete truck (not shown) by gravity. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby obviates the need to pump slurry, which is often difficult because of the viscosity of the slurry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A slurry mixer support frame <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> has a stationary portion that extends upwardly from the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a pivoting portion <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> opposite the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Pivoting of the pivoting portion <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> with respect to the stationary portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled with a hydraulic cylinder. Once in the extended position, at least one locking pin (not shown) is extended through the pivoting portion <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the stationary portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to thereby lock the pivoting portion <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in the extended position without relying on the hydraulic system. The locking pins are preferably moved between the locked and unlocked positions using a hydraulic cylinder (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A dispensing channel <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is provided in the base wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for conveying slurry out of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. A dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted in the dispensing channel <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> conveys the slurry out of the dispensing channel <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. An end of the dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is located proximate to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A slurry control valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> substantially covers the end of the dispensing auger so that slurry only flows out of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> when desired. The slurry control valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is pivotable between an open position and a closed position. Pivoting of this slurry control valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> between the open position and the closed position is preferably controlled using a hydraulic cylinder or other similar mechanism (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted therein for mixing together the materials placed in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled by a top-mounted motor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Using the top-mounted motor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> eliminates the need to use high maintenance shaft seals and permits the dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to span the entire bottom of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This configuration also enhances the ability to perform end of day cleaning on the components of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a preferably self-cleaning configuration to facilitate removing all of the slurry from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at the end of each work day. The self cleaning capability thereby minimizes the time and effort needed to clean the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and assures complete slurry removal from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a central member <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and lower rotating member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that extends from the central member <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to proximate the side wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extend upwardly from the lower rotating member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. An upper wiper <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may be attached to an upper end of the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that the upper wipers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> slide over a top cover <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to thereby wipe slurry mixture from the top cover <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Similarly, upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> extend downwardly from the top cover <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. A lower wiper <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may be attached to a lower end of the upper mixing member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> so that the lower wiper <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> slides over an upper surface of the lower member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to thereby wipe slurry mixture from the lower member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are preferably removably mounted in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This configuration permits the upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to be removed when damaged or when otherwise desired. The upper mixing members are preferably attached to the top cover <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> using bolts (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the lower rotating members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> causes the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to move between the upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and thereby cause the water, cement and other components placed in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be mixed together to produce a slurry. The slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> permits the water, cement and other components to be mixed in less than 60 seconds and preferably between about 15 seconds and 30 seconds. The slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the present invention promotes a high degree of mixing such that nearly all of the cement particles are coated with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> While not necessary, the components in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be plastic coated to reduce sticking of the slurry to the components of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Using plastic coated components in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also reduces rotational friction and lowers power consumption associated with operating the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Plastic coated components in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also enhance the ability to accurately transfer slurry from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Additionally, using plastic coated components in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> enhances the ability to clean the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at the end of the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are offset from the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, such that as the lower rotating member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is rotated, the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> pass between the upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be configured such that the upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> scrape against each other to thereby reduce the accumulation of slurry on the upper mixing members <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the lower mixing members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The outer most lower mixing member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably has a side wiper <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> that slides along the side wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as the lower rotating member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is rotated to thereby reduce accumulation of slurry on the side wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A bottom wiper <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the lower member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> so that the bottom wiper <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> slides along the bottom surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the slurry mixer to reduce accumulation of unmixed cement on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has the ability to use admixtures that control and/or enhance characteristics of the ready mix concrete prepared by the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Examples of suitable admixtures are air entrainment materials, conventional and non-corrosive accelerators, and plasticizers. Certain of these admixtures may be added to the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> while others may be used at other locations such as on the dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> or at the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The operation of the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled with a hydraulic system. Using the hydraulic system is preferable because hydraulic systems have the ability to produce high levels of forces in a relatively safe and reliable manner. The hydraulic system also permits infinitely variable control of the speed at which components such as the conveyor belt are operated. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that it is possible to use alternative mechanisms to control the operation of the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the concepts of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic system is preferably operated at a pressure of about 2,000 pounds per square inch. Using this moderate pressure level enhances the safety of the components when compared with high-pressure systems that operate at pressures of 5,000 pounds per square inch or more. This moderate pressure level also reduces wear on the pumping head used to generate the pressure used in the hydraulic system. Pumping heads used in conjunction with the hydraulic system preferably have a variable flow configuration that permits the pumping heads to slow down when oil is not needed. This feature also reduces wear on the components of the hydraulic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each of the components that is operated by the hydraulic system preferably has a partial by-pass configuration that permits the component to operate at a very slow rate of rotation even when the component is not activated. By using the by-pass circuit the large initial forces that are imparted when rotation is initially begun are substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic system is preferably powered by an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that is mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Incorporating the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> into the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be operated without regard to the proximity of utility service to the location where the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be used. A preferred internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for use with the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a diesel engine having a horsepower in that range of 150 to 300 and preferably about 220. A particularly suited internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for use with the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manufactured by Caterpillar Co. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that it is possible to power the operation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a variety of other techniques such as through electricity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be removably mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a skid (not shown) that permits the unit to be readily detached from the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for performing maintenance or repair of the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> To power the operation of the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably includes an on-board fuel storage tank <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The on-board fuel storage tank <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> has a capacity of between about 50 gallons and 200 gallons and preferably about 100 gallons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Also operably attached to the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is an air compressor (not shown) to provide compressed air as needed for the operation of certain components on the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the compressed air may be used to convey the cement from the auxiliary bulk cement storage tanker to the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> further preferably includes a high output AC alternator (not shown) operably connected thereto to power the operations of electrically powered components on the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The high output AC alternator facilitates the operation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without regard to the availability of electrical power where it is desired to use the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the alternator may be used to provide power for a computer in the control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably includes a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> mounted thereto. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> cools hydraulic oil used in the hydraulic system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> while heating water that is used in preparing the slurry. Heating the water is particularly useful when the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used in cold climates because the heated water reduces the need to add acceleration or retardation admixtures during the concrete preparation process. Cooling the hydraulic oil in the hydraulic system also increases the efficiency of the hydraulic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably includes a control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides continuous oversight of the conditions in each of the components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> permits an operator to adjust nearly all parameters relating to the operation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is preferably substantially enclosed to protect the controls from damage by environmental factors such as rain or corrosion by materials being processed in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The operation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled by at least one computer (not shown) located in the control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The computer preferably permits the individual components of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be simultaneously controlled. A person of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that alternate methods are possible to control the operation of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably includes levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that permit the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be maintained in a level orientation regardless of the conditions at the location where the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be used. The levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> thereby obviate or substantially reduce the need to excavate at the intended use site. Preferably there are a series of six levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> with the levelers being spaced around the frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are extendable varying degrees from the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using an operable attachment to the hydraulic system. The levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> preferably have a range of motion of up to 24 inches. To further stabilize the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a plate (not shown) may be placed beneath one or more of the levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Because of the height of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is in the extended position, a levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> proximate the back end of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted on outriggers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. The outriggers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> are pivotable between a retracted or transport position (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and an extended position (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Pivoting of the outriggers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> between the extended and retracted positions is preferably controlled by a hydraulic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for transferring the ready mix concrete components to the concrete mixing truck. The first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> passes beneath the sand flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the rock flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to thereby receive sand and rocks from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> conveys the sand and rock to a second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The speed rate at which the first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> operates is adjustable to permit precise control of the rate at which sand and rock are delivered to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is preferably operably attached to the pivoting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> so that as the pivoting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is moved from the storage position to the extended position, the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is also moved from a storage position to an extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Proximate the intersection of the first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is a protective cover (not shown) that extends over the first conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to prevent sand and stones from falling off the first and second conveyors <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The protective cover may also include a door (not shown) pivotally mounted proximate to an exit thereof to further reduce the potential for sand and rock falling off the first and second conveyors <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the conveyor may include side shields (not shown) that are positioned partially over the conveyors proximate the intersection of the conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second conveyors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to prevent sand and rock from falling off the conveyors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> preferably extends from the back end of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may also extend from the front end or sides of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the concepts of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> permits adjustment to compensate for different concrete mixers so that charge height can be varied. Because of the position of the concrete discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it is not necessary to excavate a loading pit. It is also possible to pivotally attach an end of the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> that is attached to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so that a height of the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> may be adjusted depending on the height of the concrete mixing trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives rock and sand from the second conveyor <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and slurry from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> imparts a spiral motion to the slurry, rock and sand as these components are fed into the drum of the concrete mixer truck, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this technique the slurry is jacketed by the rock and sand to promote uniform mixture of the slurry with the rock and sand. The spiral motion accelerates loading of the sand, rock and slurry while preventing clogging of the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Using the spiral loading motion also improves the mix quality by blending the rock and sand to prevent material segmentation. The spiral motion imparted by the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably in the same direction as the spiral motion of the drum on the concrete mixer truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> preferably has a sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. The position of the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> with respect to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is adjustable such that the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> can extend to proximate the concrete mixer truck to minimize spills. Movement of the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> with respect to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled by a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> To further reduce the amount of dust and other materials emitted from the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a drum sealing ring <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> extends from the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. When the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is lowered into a feed funnel (not shown) on the concrete mixer truck, the drum sealing ring <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> seats substantially against an upper surface of the feed funnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Proximate the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also include an admix feed chute (not shown). The admix feed chute enables admix, such as an accelerator or reinforcing fibers to be added to the ready mix concrete to thereby strengthen the concrete and obviate or reduce the need to use reinforcing bars or steel mesh in the concrete. The location at which the reinforcing fibers are added to the other components of the ready mix concrete is important because adding these fibers too early in the process presents issues with respect to conveying the reinforcing fibers along with the rest of the components while adding the reinforcing fibers too late precludes evenly dispersing the reinforcing fibers into the ready mix concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the admix or reinforcing fibers may be fed onto the dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> through the protective cover, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Feeding the reinforcing fibers in this manner is preferably accomplished through a conveyor <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention minimizes the environmental impact on the area surrounding the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> because the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> enables the concrete truck to be cleanly loaded. In particular, the concrete loading system of the present invention eliminates or at the very least substantially reduces dry packing on the mixer fins in the drum of the concrete mixer truck. Additionally, the concrete loading system of the present invention eliminates or at the very least substantially reduces dust generated during the process of loading the drum of the concrete mixer truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used in very cold conditions such as at a temperature of less than 20&deg; F., the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> included in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not able to prepare a sufficient amount of heated water that is used in an entire day. For these situations, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a supplemental hot water system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The supplemental hot water system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a hot water generation component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The hot water generation component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is preferably powered by natural gas, propane and electricity. To enhance the efficiency of the hot water generation component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, this element is preferably placed in an insulated storage trailer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that permits the hot water generation component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to be transported to a location where the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be used. The hot water generation component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is capable of heating the water to a temperature of between 100&deg; F. and 200&deg; F. and preferably about 160&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has sufficient capacity to store substantially all of the heated water that is used during an entire day of preparing ready mix concrete. The storage capacity of the hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is preferably about 15,000 gallons. To facilitate transporting the hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> along with the other elements of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> preferably includes three separate tankers that each have a capacity of about 5,000 gallons. The hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is preferably insulated to reduce the loss of temperature caused by ambient factors. Using the hot water storage component <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> thereby permits water to be heated a day before the heated water is used in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This system thereby ensures that sufficient heated water is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The components flow rate controls of the present invention permit the flow rates of the individual components to be controlled at an accuracy of more than 90 percent, preferably more than 99 percent and most preferably greater than 99.95 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Sand and gravel is preferably provided to the sand storage region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the rock storage region <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by a feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> preferably has a variable speed control to deliver the components accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> preferably has two conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> that are operably attached to a base <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> that permits the conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to be moved between a retracted position and an extended position, as most clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> When in the extended position, the conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are moved apart from each other so that the conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> remain in a substantially parallel relationship but so that the conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are aligned with the hopper into which the material is to be fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> preferably has a telescoping configuration that permits the individual conveyor belts to be moved apart from each other. Moving the conveyors modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> in this manner allows the overall width of the feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to reduced so that the feed material conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> can be transported over conventional roads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic system also preferably controls moving the individual conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> apart from each other. Moving the conveyors modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> from a retracted position to the extended position preferably takes less than 1 minute. When in the retracted configuration, the conveyor system <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> has a width of less than 100 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The method of preparing and loading the ready mix concrete into the drum of the concrete mixer truck maximizes the rate at which the components are mixed together while preventing dry pack in the drum of the concrete mixer truck. This procedure preferably entails starting the flow of sand a few seconds before the flow of rock is initiated. This technique produces a bed of sand in the mixer into which the rock is wrapped. Additionally, the flow of the lighter and liquefied materials is initiated before the heavier rock. Using the technique of the present invention permits the drum of the concrete truck to be filled with sufficient slurry, rock and sand to produce a batch of approximately 10 cubic yards of ready mix concrete in about 60 to 90 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention includes the ability to automatically compensate for the moisture level in the rock and sand. The basic mix designs in the control system are selected based upon dry rock and sand. Automatically sampling the moisture level of the aggregates with a moisture level probe as the materials are loaded into the storage hopper enables the control system to automatically compensate for variations in moisture level to thereby enhance the quality of ready mix concrete prepared by the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In operation, the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is started to create pressure in the hydraulic system. The conveyor modules <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are activated to fill the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with sand and rock, respectively. As the rock and sand are being filled into the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, respectively, the moisture content of these materials is preferably measured so that water added during the process may be adjusted to compensate for variations in the moisture in these materials. Next, the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is filled from the auxiliary bulk cement tanker and the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is filled from the water supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is activated to cause the paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to rotate in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Water and cement are fed into the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a ratio of water to cement of between 0.3 and 0.6, preferably between about 0.45 and 0.50, and most preferably about 0.48. Mixing in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is continued until a substantially homogeneous slurry mixture is produced. The mixing is preferably continued for up to 60 seconds, preferably between about 10 seconds and 30 seconds, and most preferably about 15 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is then activated to convey the slurry out of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and to the slurry pump system <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The centrifugal pump <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> conveys the slurry through the manifold <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to the slurry pumps <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The slurry pumps <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are activated to convey the slurry through the slurry line <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. After each batch of slurry is emptied from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is refilled with water and cement. Once the level of the rock, sand, cement, and water is depleted to a specified level in their respective storage regions, the appropriate restocking mechanism is activated to replenish the storage regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The sand flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the rock flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are activated to permit sand and rock to flow from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, respectively, onto the dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is activated to convey the sand and rock towards the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The height of the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and/or the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>/drum sealing ring <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> are adjusted so that the sleeve <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is positioned proximate the fill port on the drum of the concrete mixer truck (not shown). When the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in the extended position, the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is located at least 10 feet above the ground surface. When the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in the transport position, a total height of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably is less than 14 feet so that the portable concrete plant may be transported over conventional roads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> imparts a swirling motion to the sand, rock and slurry as these components pass through the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and into the drum of the concrete mixer truck. This process is continued until a desired amount of the components are fed into the concrete mixer truck. Rotational motion of the drum causes the sand, rock and slurry to be mixed together in the concrete mixer truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Throughout the process, the weight cells on each of the storage regions are monitored by the computer control system in the control room <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to ensure that the materials are being accurately delivered. When necessary adjustments are made to the settings to reduce the deviation from the desired mixing protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The flow rates of the sand, rock and water are preferably controlled by a fuzzy logic system that adjusts the rates on subsequent batches based upon the results of earlier runs to minimize overshoot and undershoot of target weights. The fuzzy logic system thereby allows the accuracy of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to increase over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When the desired amount of ready mix concrete has been prepared or the end of the day has been reached, the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is cleaned. Water is fed into the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to wash any remaining slurry from the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The wiping action provided by the side wiper <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and the lower wiping members <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> remove any remaining slurry from the side wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and from the bottom wall <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Once all of the components in the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are cleaned to a desired level, the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is shut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> When the entire project is completed and the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must be moved to another location, the components are cleaned as described above. Any rock, sand, cement and water that remains in their respective storage regions is emptied to minimize the weight of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Next, the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is lowered from an operational position to a storage position and the goose neck <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is attached to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The levelers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are raised to a storage position so that the wheels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are on the ground surface. The portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to a tractor for transport to another location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The following examples are provided to illustrate the use of the portable concrete plant <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of the method of preparing ready mix concrete according to the present invention was evaluated using the portable concrete plant of the present invention. Admix used in this example was a super plasticizer sold under the designation REOBUILD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> was activated to cause the paddle system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to rotate in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Water and cement were fed into the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the water storage vessel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the cement hopper <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a ratio of water to cement of about 0.48 in the quantities set forth below in Table 1. Mixing in the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> was continued for approximately 15 seconds until a substantially homogeneous slurry mixture was produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The dispensing auger <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> was activated to convey the slurry out of the slurry mixer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and to the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Once the level of the rock, sand, cement, and water in their respective storage regions was depleted to a specified level, the appropriate restocking mechanism was activated to replenish the storage regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The sand flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the rock flow control mechanism <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> were activated to permit sand and rock to flow from the sand hopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the rock hopper <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, respectively, onto the dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The dry material conveyor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> was activated to convey the sand and rock towards the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The rock, sand and slurry were fed through the discharge boot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and into the drum of the concrete mixer truck. </paragraph>
