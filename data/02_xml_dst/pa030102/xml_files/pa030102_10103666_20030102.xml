<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to static structures and, more particularly, to in-situ concrete forms and concrete reinforcing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In-situ concrete forms are generally known to one skilled in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,860,262 to Johnson generally discusses that Thomas Edison invented a method for casting a monolithic concrete structure in situ. The Johnson patent further describes the Edison method as &ldquo;cumbersome&rdquo; and &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo; due to the weight of the in situ concrete forms. U.S. Pat. No. 6,070,380 to Meilleur indirectly addresses the problems associated with the earlier Edison design and generally discloses a two-panel prefabricated concrete framework. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite the improvements in vertical concrete barrier construction over the past century, there still exists a need for a generally lightweight, pre-fabricated, in situ vertical concrete form which has at least one panel and one which functions both as a concrete form and concrete reinforcement. A need also remains for concrete forms which removes the need for pre-casting and allow all concrete to be poured at the construction site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This application is being concurrently filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, so the following patents are being listed for PCT purposes in lieu of the Information Disclosure Statement required under United States patent practice. The following patents are not admitted prior art, and are only included to assist the PCT Examiner with his or her search: U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,726 to Spude; No. 5,729,945 to Menchetti et al.; No. 5,553,430 to Majnaric et al.; No. 4,018,021 to Dow; and No. 520,137 to Deslauriers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The first panel may be made from a material selected from the group consisting of aluminum, steel, hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, embossed steel, pickled and oiled steel, or steel having a rust inhibitor coating. The reinforcement rib defines a shape selected from the group consisting of a C-shape cross-section, a Z-shape cross-section, and a triangular-shape cross-section, wherein the C-shape cross-section and the Z-shape cross-section each generally include a base arm, an extension arm connected to the base arm, and a retention arm connected to the extension arm, wherein the retention arm defines the retention surface. The triangular-shape cross-section reinforcement rib generally includes three spaced apart rods and an internal support lattice. The reinforcement ribs are preferably made from a material selected from the group consisting of steel, hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, embossed steel, pickled and oiled steel, and coated steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A second panel may be positioned opposite to the first panel. The second panel generally includes a first surface, a second surface positioned opposite to the first surface, and a reinforcement rib connected to the first surface of the second panel. The reinforcement rib generally includes a second retention surface spaced away from the first surface of the second panel, wherein the second retention surface is positioned in a nonperpendicular alignment with the first surface of the panel. A removable spacer bar may be positioned between the second surface of the first panel and the second surface of the second panel and the removable spacer bar may be slideably movable and further include attachment means slideably connected to the removable spacer bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A method of creating a concrete wall may include the steps of a) installing a first panel having a first surface, a second surface positioned opposite to the first surface, and a reinforcement rib connected to the first surface of the first panel, the reinforcement rib generally including a retention surface spaced away from the first surface of the first panel, wherein the retention surface is positioned in a non-perpendicular alignment with the first surface of the first panel, b) pouring concrete adjacent to the first surface of the first panel such that the reinforcement rib extends into the concrete, and c) curing the concrete. Additional steps may include d) applying a decorative or rust-inhibition coating to the second surface of the panel, e) installing a second panel opposite to the first panel, the second panel also having a first surface, a second surface positioned opposite to the first surface, and a reinforcement rib connected to the first surface of the panel, the reinforcement rib generally including a second retention surface spaced away from the first surface of the second panel, wherein the second retention surface is positioned in a non-perpendicular alignment with the first surface of the second panel, f) installing a removable spacer bar between the second surface of the first panel and the second surface of the second panel, g) installing an attachment means on the removable spacer bar, and h) removing the removable spacer bar after the concrete has cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages of the present invention will be clarified in the description of the preferred embodiment taken together with the attached drawings in which like reference numerals represent like elements throughout.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention described herein is also described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/278,062, entitled &ldquo;Manufactured Reinforced Concrete System,&rdquo; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to in situ concrete forms. An in situ concrete form is defined herein as a structure having one or more panels and at least one reinforcement rib connected to one side of each panel. The in situ concrete form is not removed once concrete cures adjacent to the panels and reinforcement ribs. The reinforcement rib or ribs extend into the concrete, and the panels and reinforcement ribs add structural support to the poured concrete. The reinforcement ribs attached to the panel skin substitutes for traditional reinforcement commonly known as deformed bars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an in situ concrete form <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attached thereto. Each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generally defines a first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> positioned opposite to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made from eleven-gauge hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, embossed steel, pickled and oiled steel, or other suitable structural material. As noted earlier, one or more panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be connected together, such as by welding or other suitable attachment method, to create differently-shaped in situ concrete forms <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The gauge thickness of each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be increased or decreased depending on the particular application. Moreover, the second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be embossed or conditioned to receive a decorative rust preventive, such as paint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably reinforced with a reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which may horizontally span the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a uniform or non-uniform distance D. In one preferred spacing configuration, each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is spaced eight to sixteen inches apart, with a spacing of twelve to sixteen inches for an eleven- or twelve-gauge steel panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably made from eleven-gauge steel or other suitable structural material, but other gauge thicknesses are also contemplated. The width W of each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is approximately three to twenty-four inches, depending on the particular application, with a minimum of three inches being preferred. Standard angle iron I may be added to provide reinforcement and carrying handles for the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may form a general C-shape in cross-section, and include a base arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an extension arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which preferably extends approximately three or more inches W away from the base arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a retention arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which defines a retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, a variety of additional cross-sectional shapes are also contemplated. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B show another generally C-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A which is similar to the C-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, except the reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A further includes one or more tabs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent to the base arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the retention arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. One or more of other generally C-shaped reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A may also be positioned on the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the extension arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to provide carrying handles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 4B</cross-reference>, each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A may also define one or more passageways <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The passageways <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> increase bond strength of the reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A with concrete, allow for the insertion of additional horizontally extending reinforcement ribs to increase structural value and aid in the alignment of stacked panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sections, and allow for the threading of conduit piping or other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> each show a generally Z-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B having a retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> defined by the retention arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as well as a possible second retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, defined by the extension arm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Passageways may also be defined by the Z-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B each generally show a triangular, cross-sectional-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C having three spaced apart rods <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C, an open internal support lattice <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and one or two retention surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C, depending on whether one of the rods <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A or two of the rods <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C are positioned adjacent to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition to these cross-sectional shapes, other cross-sectional shapes such as a W-shape, a T-shape, an H-shape, an L-shape, or any other suitable cross-sectional shape could also be used. The only requirement is that each reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have a retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> spaced away from the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, preferably at a distance of approximately three or more inches, wherein the retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is positioned in a parallel or other non-perpendicular alignment with the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (or second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, in the C-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, the retention surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is substantially perpendicular to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the triangular-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an outer surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the extended rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A or rods <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C define the retention surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, one application of the present invention may be to help define a pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In this application, a cavity <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is excavated from the ground <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with corresponding reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B are positioned in the cavity <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are the Z-shaped reinforcement ribs shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, but any other suitable cross-sectional shape may be used. The reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B are purposely spaced away from the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to clearly show the complete structure of each Z-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B. However, in practice, the base arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of each Z-shaped reinforcement rib <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B is connected to the first surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of each panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Reinforcement bars <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such as five-eighths inch diameter rebar, may be also positioned in the pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, particularly if a load will be carried on a base portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Base plates <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may also be positioned at a second end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to help distribute weight. Depending on the particular application, a standard footer may also be prepared adjacent to the base portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A temporary removable spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may also be added during concrete pouring to assist support until the concrete cures. In practice, the form can be suspended from above and concrete placing can be continuous from the base or floor up through the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, concrete <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is next poured into channels <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> defined between one or more panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and walls <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Other reinforcement bars <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may also be added, depending on the amount of weight which will be carried on a working surface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent to the pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B extend into the concrete <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and help to hold each panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in place. Once the concrete <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has cured, the spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be removed, and the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provide structural support to the cured concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Another converse application is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the present invention may be used to make a pedestal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for supporting a piece of machinery. In this application, panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are arranged to form an open container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which receives concrete <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Not the absence of rebar in the drawings because the present inventive system satisfies most civil engineering for conventional rebar; note also that rebar <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> appears in the structural floor on which the plinth is positioned. However, unlike the previous pit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> application, the spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> remains in place, and in this case, spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also acts as a positioning bar for embedded anchor bolt assemblies, as described below, or other embedded items. The spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> adds tensile strength to an engagement surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the pedestal. Second, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, attachment means <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, such as threaded anchor bolts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> housed in an oversized housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, may be attached to the spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The oversized housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> allows a corresponding threaded anchor bolt <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to be aligned with a piece of machinery after the concrete <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has cured around the oversized housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, any miscalculation in initial placing the threaded anchor bolts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> would result in improper alignment of the threaded anchor bolts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with respect to the machine or other installed device. To further help with alignment, the spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may ride in C-shaped reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to allow movement in the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> direction and the attachment means <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may move in the A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> directions along a longitudinal length of the spacer bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention is a preformed, in-situ, vertical concrete mold which is usually built in shop conditions and shipped to a site already completed or in panelized pieces that are easy to assemble on site. Each panel may have an exposed decorative surface and at least one associated reinforcement rib which is embedded in the concrete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment. Obvious modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
