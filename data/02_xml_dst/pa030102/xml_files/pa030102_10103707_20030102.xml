<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing process and more particularly to a high density read only memory (HDROM) and fabrication method thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor fabrication technology have known a rapid and a spectacular development leading from sub micron fabrication to deep-sub micron fabrication. The size of thus produced semiconductor device is even smaller. As a result, the size of chip is decreased and the number of chips formed on each wafer is increased. And in turn the fabrication cost of each chip is reduced as the number and operating speed of transistors on a chip are increased. The number of transistors is double every one and half year based on Morgan&apos;s theory. As such, memory size of an integrated circuit (IC) has increased from past several thousand bits per chip to current several ten million bits per chip. In the case of read only memory (ROM), there are ICs having 1 Giga-bit capacity available now. Currently, ROMs having 64 million-bit are the most popular one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In view of this trend, ROM capacity and operating speed will be higher as time goes as required by electronic product manufacturers. Hence, it is obvious that high density high capacity ROMs are the main stream of development. It is also anticipated that high density ROMs will replace current semiconductor products as the dominant product in the near future. As such, most semiconductor manufacturers endeavor to develop such products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Currently, a NAND gate based architecture is incorporated in each cell of existing HDROMs for decreasing the number of contacts. It is advantageous for decreasing the area of chip. It is disadvantageous, however that resistance of serially connected cells becomes large by incorporating such NAND gate architecture. As such, a RC delay is occurred due to increase of resistance value (R) of the serially connected cell. And in turn the speed of reading, writing, or erasing is slowed. Further, ROMs having such NAND gates are fabricated by utilizing Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or hot carrier writing principle. Hence, cells tend to over program, thus causing the number of electrons in floating gate to increase excessively. As a result, critical threshold voltage of the conventional ROM cell is increased beyond control which in turn causes the channel of cell to be cut off permanently. Hence, such conventional HDROMs are limited in electronic applications. Thus improvement exists. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a high density read only memory and fabrication method thereof. The method comprises the step of fabricating a plurality of spaced post transistors on a wafer by implanting and trench etching wherein each post transistor has four vertical surfaces with one of vertical surfaces as a short circuit junction between substrate and source and a read only memory (ROM) cell formed on each of the three remaining vertical surfaces. This can maintain a critical threshold voltage on transistors of ROM cells at the same level while there is a voltage drop between substrate and source thereof. Further, in the layout of ROM cells drains of ROM cells are alternately coupled together because a word line is shared by adjacent ROM cells. Therefore, the invention can fabricate three ROM cells in a single post transistor for storing three-bit data, thereby fabricating high density ROM cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A high density read only memory (HDROM) of the invention is fabricated by the following process: Fabricating a plurality of spaced post transistors on a wafer by implanting and trench etching wherein each post transistor has four vertical surfaces with one of vertical surfaces as a short circuit junction between substrate and source and a read only memory (ROM) cell formed on each of the three remaining vertical surfaces. That is, the invention can fabricate three ROM cells in a single post transistor for storing three-bit data. As described that read only memory cell having a high density feature will be called high density read only memory (HDROM) in a description of the specification thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> where a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown wherein a high density arsenic (As) is implanted on a p type wafer. The p type wafer is doped by As ions to form a n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is served as source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of HDROM of the invention. Then a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (note that a physical vapor deposition (PVD) or a photon-induced chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) may employed in other embodiments) or implanting is employed to epitaxially fabricate (or implant) a p type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a thickness of about 0.5 to 2 &mgr;m on the n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the invention after boron ions have been doped in the epitaxial process, doping density near n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be higher than that of other areas. The doping density will be decreased as the epitaxial thickness reached about 0.2 to 0.4 &mgr;m. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> Hence, p&plus; and p&minus; type semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are formed on the n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then p&plus; and p&minus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are formed as substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of ROM cell respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Then fabricates a plurality of spaced post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the p&plus; and p&minus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by lithography and trench etching wherein each post transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has four vertical surfaces (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Then high density phosphor (P) ions are implanted on post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to dope P ions on the surface of p&minus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to form a n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the top of each post transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. n&plus; type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is served as drain of HDROM cell of the invention. In the plan view of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. such formed post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are arranged in a matrix shape with each post transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> equally spaced apart from the adjacent post transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in either X axis or Y axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the epitaxial process, doping density of boron ions near source (i.e. n&plus; type semiconductor layer) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in p type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is higher than that of other areas due to the following reasons: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (1) In the ROM cell manufacturing process, if boron ions on some channels <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> have higher density, after ROM cells are processed in an anti-punch-through process the punch-through between the drain <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may not occur when a lower punch-through voltage is applied on ROM cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (2) Since a high voltage will apply on drain <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of ROM cell low density boron ions near channel of drain <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ROM cells may have a higher junction breakdown voltage when drain <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of ROM cell is being programmed or erased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (3) Since boron ions of ROM cell have a higher density near channel of source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the threshold voltage on the channel will be high. To the contrary, since boron ions of ROM cell have a lower density near another channel of drain <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the threshold voltage on the channel will be low. Hence, there are two different levels of threshold voltage on the same channel. When a predetermined voltage is applied on gate to turn on the channel, a source-side-injection will occur to generate many gate hot carriers. As a result, the program efficiency and speed of electrons will be much higher than that of conventional stacked ROM cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (4) Typically, a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or hot carrier writing principle is utilized in the conventional stacked ROM cells. Hence, cells tend to over program, thus causing the number of electrons in floating gate to increase excessively. As a result, critical threshold voltage of the conventional ROM cell is increased beyond control which in turn causes the channel of cell to be cut off permanently. In contrast in the invention p type semiconductor device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two different density portions after implanted, thus causing critical voltage near source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be higher for turning off the channel. As a result, an over erasure effect is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Also, lithography and trench etching utilized by the invention to form post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on semiconductor devices may cause an over etching. Hence, a space <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is defined by four adjacent post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after etched (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The size of space <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is suitable to fabricate floating gates, control gate, and insulated oxide of the invention therein. Hence, the width of space <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is required to be equal to or larger than a minimum width for disposing two floating gates, a control gate, and insulated layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an oxidation process is performed on above semiconductor devices at a temperature about 800 to 950&deg; C. by the invention so as to grow a first oxide layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> thereon (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The thickness of oxide layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is about 70 to 120 &angst;. Such first oxide layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used as tunnel oxide of ROM cell in the invention. The quality of first oxide layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> determines the cycling endurance of ROM cell, the date retention of electrons in floating gate, and efficiency of programming and erasing electrons. Further, the oxidation also has the following meanings: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (1) Poly-silicon may be crystallized again to from a single crystal in a high temperature manufacturing process; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (2) Defect occurred in implanting in above high temperature manufacturing process may be repaired and doping in the implanting may be made active. Then the invention utilize CVD epitaxial technique to grow a first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on first oxide layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> again, the thickness of first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about 200 to 300 &angst;. First poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is served as floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on ROM cell in the invention. Then etch away a portion of first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that there is no first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> remained on the top of post transistor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then a photoresist <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is coated on post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). A masking <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and lithography are employed to define floating gates on first poly-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A trench etching is then performed to etch away undesired poly-silicon and photoresist <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, two floating gates <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> are formed between two adjacent post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then CVD epitaxial technique is alternately employed to grow oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on semiconductor devices. ONO layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> remained on post transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are etched away to form desired ONO layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In subsequent processes, such ONO layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be used as an insulation layer between later formed second poly-silicon layer and floating gate <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. In the invention a low temperature manufacturing process is employed to grow ONO layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> because doping density in ROM cells may be deformed in a high temperature manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Note that the whole surface of wafer is the object to be sequentially processed in previous processes by the invention. Hence, after ONO layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> have been formed the configuration of one side of post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (e.g., viewed along X axis) is the same as that of the other side of post transistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (e.g., viewed along Y axis). However, in the following manufacturing processes of the invention the configuration of one side of semiconductor devices (e.g., viewed along X axis) is not the same as that of the other side of semiconductor devices (e.g., viewed along Y axis).
