<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a waste water inspecting agent by which safety of waste water effluent from factories and the like may be easily and surely inspected and also to a waste water inspecting apparatus using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, an increase in industrial waste discharged from factories, enterprises, and the like has become a social problem. Among those industrial wastes, waste water discharged in a large amount requires urgent and effective countermeasures to be taken in order to effectively reduce pollution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Example of such industrial waste water include washed and rinsed liquids from a washing step of metal, glass, resin and printed circuit board, waste water from the developing generated from a plating step and the like. On the other hand, with regard to a domestic wastewater, examples include food waste water discharged from restaurants and the like. All of them contain organic substances as components and the substances are recycled back to nature by methods using membrane, activated charcoal, microbes and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, in inspecting the waste waters or particularly in measuring heavy metals, the sample is extracted with a solvent or evaporated to concentrate under an acidic condition and then the concentration of the aimed element in the inspection solution is determined by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the atomic absorption spectrometry, however, the light source is different for each of the aimed elements and a pretreatment operation and analytic method are different as well. Accordingly, there are problems in that the operation is generally troublesome, time consuming until analytical result is obtained and moreover, automated measurement is difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there has been a strong demand for safety of waste water discharged from factories, and for such waste water to be easily and quickly inspected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a waste water inspecting agent by which heavy metals, harmful organic compounds, agricultural chemicals, genetic recombinant cells, and the like contained in waste water from factories, and the like may be quickly and easily inspected and also to provide a waste water inspecting apparatus using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The waste water inspecting apparatus of the present invention is used as an additive to a specimen solution and comprises a rod-shaped body and a capturing structured element which specifically captures an object to be captured which is captured to the rod-shaped body in the specimen solution, thereby Heavy metals, harmful organic compounds, agricultural chemicals, and gene recombinated cells may be detected swiftly and simply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The first aspect of the waste water inspecting apparatus of the present invention is that it has a rod-shaped body having a length of 810 nm or less and a capturing structured element specifically capturing, by bonding to the rod-shaped body, an object to be captured contained in the specimen solution. The waste water inspecting apparatus also reflects an incident light as colored interference light by aligning in a film-like shape and is provided with an adding means for contacting the waste water inspecting agent to a sample to be examined and a wavelength measuring means for measuring the change in the wavelength brought out by the light reflection as colored interference light of the film-shaped waste water inspecting agent which captures the object to be captured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The waste water inspecting agent aligned in a film-like shape reflecting the incident light as colored interference light on the basis of a multi-layer thin film interference theory which is a basic principle of color foramtion of the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly. When the change in wavelength based on light reflectance as colored interference light by changes in length or refractive index upon the specific capturing of the object to be captured by the film like waste water inspecting agent is measured, presence of the captured object may be inspected and monitoring of waste treatment is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The second aspect of the waste water inspecting apparatus of the present invention is that it has a rod-shaped body and a capturing structured element which specifically captures, by bonding to the rod-shaped body, an object to be captured contained in the specimen solution and is provided with a biosensor where a waste water inspecting agent which is amphiphilic is adhered and bonded in a film-like shape to a quartz oscillator or a surface acoustic wave (SAW) element, an oscillation circuit where a mass change or a viscoelasticity change when the object to be captured is captured by the biosensor is oscillated as a frequency, and a frequency counter where the frequency of the oscillation oscillated from the oscillation circuit is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As a result, changes in mass or changes in viscoelasticity when the capturing structured element of the waste water inspecting agent constituting the biosensor specifically captures the object to be captured may be detected as a frequency under high sensitivity in a short time.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown as an example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the waste water inspecting agent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is used as additive to a specimen and has a rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a capturing structured element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which specifically captures, by bonding to the rod-shaped body, an object to be captured contained in the specimen solution. Incidentally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the capturing structured element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is bonded to one end of the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, it may be also bonded to the circumferential side of the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, in that case, it is also possible to have a plural capturing structured element bonded to the circumferential side of the rod-shaped body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> &lt;Rod-Shaped Body&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The rod-shaped body is not particularly limited provided that it is rod-shaped, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. The rod-shaped body may be either a rod-shaped inorganic substance or rod-shaped organic substance, but a rod-shaped organic substance is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Examples of rod-shaped organic substances are biopolymers, polysaccharides, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Suitable examples of biopolymers are fibrous proteins, &agr;-helix polypeptides, nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and the like. Examples of fibrous proteins are fibrous proteins having &agr;-helix structures such as &agr;-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomyosin, silk fibroin, and the like. Suitable examples of polysaccharides are amylose and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Among rod-shaped organic substances, spiral organic molecules whose molecules have a spiral structure are preferable from the standpoints of stable maintenance of the rod shape and internal intercalatability of other substances in accordance with an object. Among the aforementioned substances, those with spiral organic molecules include &agr;-helix polypeptides, DNA, amylose, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> &lcub;&agr;-Helix Polypeptides&rcub;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> &agr;-helix polypeptides are referred to as one of the secondary structures of polypeptides. The polypeptide rotates one time (forms one spiral) for each amino acid 3.6 residue, and a hydrogen bond, which is substantially parallel to the axis of the helix, is formed between a carbonyl group (&mdash;CO&mdash;) and an imide group (&mdash;NH&mdash;) of each fourth amino acid, and this structure is repeated in units of seven amino acids. In this way, the &agr;-helix polypeptide has a structure which is stable energy-wise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The direction of the spiral of the &agr;-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may be either wound right or wound left. Note that, in nature, only structures whose direction of spiral is wound right exist from the standpoint of stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The amino acids which form the &agr;-helix polypeptide are not particularly limited provided that an &agr;-helix structure can be formed, and can be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, amino acids which facilitate formation of the &agr;-helix structure are preferable. Suitable examples of such amino acids are aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), histidine (His), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and the like. A single one of these amino acids may be used alone, or two or more may be used in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> By appropriately selecting the amino acid, the property of the &agr;-helix polypeptide can be changed to any of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic. In the case in which the &agr;-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophilic, suitable examples of the amino acid are serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), and the like. In the case in which the &agr;-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophobic, suitable examples of the amino acid are phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), isoleucine (Ile), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the &agr;-helix polypeptide, the carboxyl group, which does not form a peptide bond and which is in the amino acid which forms the &agr;-helix, can be made to be hydrophobic by esterification. On the other hand, an esterified carboxyl group can be made to be hydrophilic by hydrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The amino acid may be any of a L-amino acid, a D-amino acid, a derivative in which the side chain portion of a L-amino acid or a D-amino acid is modified, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) of the amino acid in the &agr;-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, 10 to 5000 is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If the number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) is less than 10, it may not be possible for the polyamino acid to form a stable &agr;-helix. If the number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) exceeds 5000, vertical orientation may be difficult to achieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Suitable specific examples of the &agr;-helix polypeptide are polyglutamic acid derivatives such as poly(&ggr;-methyl L-glutamate), poly(&ggr;-ethyl L-glutamate), poly(&ggr;-benzyl L-glutamate), poly(n-hexyl L-glutamate), and the like; polyaspartic acid derivatives such as poly(&bgr;-benzyl L-aspartate) and the like; polypeptides such as poly(L-leucine), poly(L-alanine), poly(L-methionine), poly(L-phenylalanine), poly(L-lysine)-poly(&ggr;-methyl L-glutamate), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The &agr;-helix polypeptide may be a commercially available &agr;-helix polypeptide, or may be appropriately synthesized or prepared in accordance with methods disclosed in known publications and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As one example of synthesizing the &agr;-helix polypeptide, the synthesis of block copolypeptide &lsqb;poly(L-lysine)<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>-poly(&ggr;-methyl L-glutamate)<highlight><subscript>60</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PLLZ<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>-PMLG<highlight><subscript>60 </subscript></highlight>is as follows. As is shown by the following formula, block copolypeptide &lsqb;poly(L-lysine)<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>-poly(&ggr;-methyl L-glutamate)<highlight><subscript>60</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PLLZ<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>-PMLG<highlight><subscript>60 </subscript></highlight>can be synthesized by polymerizing N<highlight><superscript>&egr;</superscript></highlight>-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N<highlight><superscript>&agr;</superscript></highlight>-carboxy acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) by using n-hexylamine as an initiator, and then polymerizing &ggr;-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxy acid anhydride (MLG-NCA).

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Synthesis of the &agr;-helix polypeptide is not limited to the above-described method, and the &agr;-helix polypeptide can be synthesized by a genetic engineering method. Specifically, the &agr;-helix polypeptide can be manufactured by transforming a host cell by a expression vector in which is integrated a DNA which encodes the target polypeptide, and culturing the transformant, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Examples of the expression vector include a plasmid vector, a phage vector, a plasmid and phage chimeric vector, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Examples of the host cell include prokaryotic microorganisms such as <highlight><italic>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, </italic></highlight>and the like; eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast and the like; zooblasts, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The &agr;-helix polypeptide may be prepared by removing the &agr;-helix structural portion from a natural fibrous protein such as &agr;-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomyosin, silk fibroin, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> &lcub;DNA&rcub;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The DNA may be a single-stranded DNA. However, the DNA is preferably a double-stranded DNA from the standpoints that the rod-shape can be stably maintained, other substances can be intercalated into the interior, and the like. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the formulae (1) and (2), &lgr; means wavelength (nm) of the interference light, &agr; means angle of incidence (degree) of the light to the film, t means thickness (nm) of a single film, l means number of layers of the film, n means a refractive index of the film and m means an integer of 1 or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light may be obtained by aligning the waste water inspecting agent into a film-like shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thickness of the single film is preferably 810 nm or less and, more preferably, it is from 10 nm to 810 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> When the thickness is appropriately changed, color (wavelength) of the light reflection of the incident light as interference light may be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The film may be either a monomolecular film or a two layered monomolecular films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The monomolecular film or the layered films comprising the same may be formed by, for example, a Langmuir-Brodgett method (LB method) and, in that case, a known LB film forming apparatus (such as NL-LB 400 NK-MWC manufactured by Nippon Laser &amp; Electronics Laboratories) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Formation of the monomolecular film may be carried out, for example, in such a state that the rod-shaped body which is lipophilic (hydrophobic) or amphiphilic is floated on water surface (on an aqueous phase) or in such a state that the rod-shaped body which is lipophilic (hydrophobic) or amphiphilic is floated on oil surface (on an oil phase) or, in other words, the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is aligned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> so as to form on a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> using an pushing material <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When such an operation is repeatedly carried out, the layered films where the monomolecular films are layered in any number may be formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, it is preferred that the monomolecular film or the layered film is fixed on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> since the reflection of the incident light as colored interference light by the monomolecular film or layered films is expressed in a stable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In that case, there is no particular limitation for the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and, according to the object, its material, shape, size, and the like may be appropriately selected although it is preferred that its surface is appropriately subjected to a surface treatment previously with an object that the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is easily adhered or bonded thereto. When the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (such as &agr;-helix polypeptide) is hydrophilic for example, it is preferred that a surface treatment such as hydrophilizing treatment using octadecyl trimethylsiloxane and the like is previously carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> With regard to the state where the rod-shaped body is floated on an oil phase or an aqueous phase in the formation of the monomolecular film of the amphiphilic rod-shaped body, the lipophilic areas (hydrophobic areas) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are aligned in an adjacent state to each other on the aqueous phase or oil phase while the hydrophilic areas <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are aligned in an adjacent state each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The above is an example of a layered membrane or a layered films comprising the same where the rod-shaped body is aligned in the plane direction of the monomolecular film (in a horizontal state) while a monomolecular film where the rod-shaped body is aligned in the thickness direction of the monomolecular film (in a vertical state) may be manufactured, for example, as follows. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, water (aqueous phase) is made alkaline of around pH 12 under such a state that the amphiphilic rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide) is floated on the water surface (aqueous phase) (i.e., in a horizontal state). As a result, in the hydrophilic area <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide), the &agr;-helix structure thereof is disentangled to give a random structure. At that time, the lipophilic area (hydrophobic area) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide) maintains its &agr;-helix structure. Then, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) is made acidic to about 5 thereby the hydrophilic area <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide) forms an &agr;-helix structure again. When the pushing material attached to the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide) is pushed by the pressure of air from its side to the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide), the rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> maintains vertical against water (aqueous phase) while its hydrophilic area <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forms an &agr;-helix structure in the direction substantially orthogonal to the water surface in the aqueous phase. When the aligned rod-shaped body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&agr;-helix polypeptide) is pushed out onto the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> using a pushing material <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as mentioned above by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is possible to form a monomolecular film on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When such operation is repeatedly carried out, the layered films having prescribed number of monomolecular film may be formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Example of the waste water inspecting agent having a single layer or laminated layers which may reflect the incident light as colored interference light could be an amphiphilic waste water inspecting agent, and preferably the rod-shaped body is &agr;-helix polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Waste water inspecting agent of the present invention may be a inspecting agent which precipitates or form gels when object to be captured is captured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The waste water inspecting agent of the preset invention is not particularly limited. The waste water inspecting agent is added to the waste water discharged from factories, and the like and changes in color tone or wavelength of the light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light by capturing the object to be captured by the waste water inspecting agent are measured whereby the presence of the object to be captured in the waste water may be confirmed. It is preferred that the waste water inspecting agent is added in a form of a state of emulsion to the waste water or the like to measure the changes in color tone or wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> To be specific, when a protein (metallothioneine or thioneine-like protein) having an affinity to heavy metals is used as the object to be captured and a waste water inspecting agent where the protein is bonded to a rod-shaped body is used, the heavy metals (zinc, cadmium, copper, mercury, and the like) in the waste water may be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When a waste water inspecting agent in which a crown ether compound is used as a capturing structure material and bonded to a rod-shaped body is used, various metal ions in the waste water such as alkaline metals (Li, Na, K, and the like), alkaline earth metals(Mg, Ca, and the like), and the like may be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> When a waste water inspecting agent in which cyclodextrin is used as a capturing structure material and is bonded to the rod-shaped body is used, presence of the toxic organic compounds, and the like in the waste water may be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> When a waste water inspecting agent in which an antibody to endocrine disruptors in the environment such as bisphenol A, nonylphenyl, phthalate, and the like is used as a capturing structure material and is bonded to the rod-shaped body is used, presence of the endocrine disruptors in the environment in the waste water may be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> &lt;Waste Water Inspecting Apparatus&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the waste water inspecting apparatus of the present invention is equipped with a waste water inspecting agent having a rod-shaped body and a capturing structure material which captures the object to be captured contained in the waste water to be inspected which is bonded to the rod-shaped body and reflecting the incident light as colored interference light by aligning in a film-like shape; an adding means where the waste water inspecting agent is contacted to a sample; and a colored wavelength measuring means in which changes in wavelength by light reflection of the colored interference light of the film like waste water inspecting agent which is bonded to the object to be captured are measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> For the liquid to be inspected, there is no particular limitation as long as it contains an object to be captured which is an object for the inspection and there may be examples such as water in the rivers and streams, waste water from factories, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> With regard to the adding means, there is no particular limitation so far as it is a means for adding a predetermined amount of the waste water inspecting agent is added to the sample to be examined or it is a means for adding a predetermined amount of the sample to be examined to the waste water inspecting agent. It is preferred however that the amount of the waste water inspecting agent is made to such an extent that the light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light may be easily detected by aligning in a film-like shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> One of the preferred aspects of the waste water inspecting apparatus is an aspect in which the waste water inspecting agent is amphiphilic and the adding means is a means for adding the waste water inspecting agent and the oil phase thereof into an aqueous sample and for bringing the waste water inspecting agent to contact the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In that case, the waste water inspecting agent is amphiphilic in which the waste water inspecting agent is aligned vertically to comprise a film-like shape at the interface between the oil phase and the aqueous phase and, therefore, it is preferred because changes in wavelength caused by the light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light are easily measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The waste water inspecting apparatus in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention is provided with a biosensor where the waste water inspecting agent of the present invention is adhered and bonded in a film-like shape to a quartz oscillator or a surface acoustic wave (SAW) element, an oscillation circuit where changes in mass or changes in viscoelasticity when the object to be captured is captured by the biosensor are oscillated as a frequency and a frequency counter where the frequency of the oscillation oscillated from the oscillation circuit is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In that case, it is preferred that the waste water inspecting agent is adhered and bonded in a monomolecular film-like shape to the quartz oscillator or to the surface acoustic wave (SAW) element or is adhered and bonded in a bimolecular film-like shape thereto. With regard to the frequency counter, there is no particular limitation so far as it is able to precisely measure the frequency from the quartz oscillator or the surface acoustic wave (SAW) element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the quartz oscillator, metal electrodes are vapor deposited on the surface and the back of a thin quartz plate. An example of the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a plane view while FIG. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B is a front view. An electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is vapor deposited on the surface of the quartz plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> while another electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is vapor deposited on the back thereof. The electrodes extend to the left side from the electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the left ends thereof are connected to clip-type lead wires (not shown) followed by connecting to an alternating current source (not shown). When alternating current is applied between the electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there is generated oscillation of a predetermined period in the quartz plate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> due to a back piezoelectric effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> On the surface of the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, there is adhered and bonded a waste water inspecting agent film (not shown). The capturing bonding material of this waste water inspecting agent film captures the object to be captured and mass of the surface of the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes corresponding to the mass of the captured disease marker whereby the resonance frequency changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Between the changes in the resonance frequency and changes in the mass of the waste water inspecting agent film coated on the surface of the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which oscillates in parallel to the plane vertical to the thickness direction, there is a relation as shown in the following formula (3) whereby changes in the mass may be detected from changes in the resonance frequency. For example, in the case of an oscillator of resonance frequency of 9 MHz (area: about 0.5 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), a reduction in frequency of 400 Hz is resulted by an increase in mass of 1 &mgr;g. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;<highlight><italic>F&equals;&minus;</italic></highlight>2.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&times;&Dgr;W/A</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the formula, F means resonance frequency (MHz) of the quartz oscillator, &Dgr;F means changes (Hz) in the resonance frequency by changes in mass, &Dgr;W means changes in mass (g) of the film and A means a surface area (cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> An example of the waste water inspecting apparatus is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (waste water inspecting agent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bonded on the surface in a film-like shape) is attached to an arm for attaching the quartz oscillator and dipped in a solution in a thermostat heat block <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The thermostat heat block <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is to keep the temperature of the solution constant. The solution is stirred by a stirrer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In a sample injection <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a sample to be measured is injected into a solution. In the oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, alternating current field is applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to oscillate the quartz oscillator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Oscillation frequency of the oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is counted by a counter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, analyzed by a computer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and mass of the object to be captured in the sample is indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The object to be captured is specifically captured as such by the capturing bonding material of the waste water inspecting agent in which mass of the waste water inspecting agent changes. The change in the mass is detected by the quartz oscillator and converted to frequency and, therefore, when the change in frequency is measured by the frequency counter, the presence or absence of the object to be captured may be specifically inspected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> When a calibration curve is previously prepared using an object to be captured of a known amount, the object to be captured concentration to be detected or quantified in the sample may be detected or quantified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The surface acoustic wave (SAW) element is an element where a pair of comb-shaped electrodes is set on the surface of the solid and electric signal is converted to a surface acoustic wave (sonic wave transmitting the solid surface, ultrasonic wave), transmitted to the encountering electrode and outputted as electric signal again whereby signal of specific frequency corresponding to the stimulation may be taken out. Ferroelectric a substance such as lithium tantalite and lithium niobate, quartz, zinc oxide thin film, and the like are used as the material therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The SAW is elastic wave which transmits along the surface of the medium and exponentially decreases in the inside area of the medium. In the SAW, the transmitted energy is concentrated on the surface of the medium whereby the changes in the medium surface may be sensitively detected and, as a result of the changes in the mass of the surface, the SAW transmitting velocity changes as same as in the case of quartz oscillator. Usually, SAW transmitting velocity is measured as the changes in oscillation frequency using an oscillation circuit. Changes in the oscillation frequency are given by the following formula. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the formula, k<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and k<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mean constants, h means thickness of the fixed film, &rgr; means density of the film, &lgr; and &mgr; mean Lame constants of the film and V<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>means a SAW transmitting velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a schematic plane view which shows an example of constitution of main parts of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) element. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in the SAW element sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there are formed gold electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and comb-shaped electrodes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at both ends thereof on the SAW element having a resonance frequency of 90 MHz made of an ST cut quartz and there is formed a film (not shown) comprising the waste water inspecting agent in the surface wave transmitting region <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as shown by dotted lines. The sensor is connected to a frequency counter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> from each comb-shaped electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via a high-frequency amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> whereby the mass of the object to be captured in the sample is indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The object to be captured in the sample is specifically captured by the capturing bonding material of the waste water inspecting agent whereby mass or viscoelasticity of the waste water inspecting agent changes, the mass change or viscoelasticity change is detected by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) element and converted to frequency and, therefore, when this frequency change is measured by the frequency counter, it is now possible to specifically examine whether or not the object to be captured is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> When a calibration curve is previously prepared using an object to be captured of a known amount, the object to be captured to be detected or quantified in the sample may be detected or quantified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> With regard to a method for a chemical bonding/fixing of the waste water inspecting agent on the electrodes of the quartz oscillator or the surface acoustic wave (SAW) element which constitutes the biosensor, there is no particular limitation and that may be appropriately selected according to the object. For example, that may be carried out by means of a chemical bond such as covalent bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> With regard to the covalent bond method, there is no particular limitation but the same one which is used for bonding the capturing bonding material to the rod-shaped body in the waste water inspecting agent may be appropriately selected and used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> To be specific, there may be exemplified a method where a substance where thiol group is introduced into the end of the waste water inspecting agent is synthesized, the quartz oscillator or the surface acoustic wave (SAW) element is dipped in its solution and made to react therewith for a predetermined time and then the biosensor to which the waste water inspecting agent is chemically bonded/fixed is taken out from the solution followed by drying. The thiol group covers S-trityl-3-mercaptopropyloxy-&bgr;-cyanoethyl-N,N-diiso-propylaminophosphoramidide and the like and introduction of the thiol group into the end of the waste water inspecting agent may be carried out by a phosphoramidide method. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Polymerization of N<highlight><superscript>&egr;</superscript></highlight>-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N<highlight><superscript>&agr;</superscript></highlight>-carboxylic acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) was carried out using n-hexylamine as an initiator and then polymerization of &ggr;-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxylic acid anhydride (MLG-NCA) was carried out to prepare a block copolypeptide PLLZ<highlight><subscript>2000</subscript></highlight>-PMLG<highlight><subscript>600 </subscript></highlight>where degree of polymerization of a PLLZ moiety was 2000 and that of a PMLG moiety was 600. After that, the PMLG segment was partially hydrolyzed to give L-glutamic acid (LGA) thereby an &agr;-helix copolypeptide PLLZ<highlight><subscript>250</subscript></highlight>-P(MLG<highlight><subscript>420</subscript></highlight>/LGA<highlight><subscript>180</subscript></highlight>) was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Avidin was introduced into the &agr;-helix copolypeptide and was bonded to a biotin-labeled thioneine-like protein (prepared by a method described in <highlight><italic>J. Ferment. Bioeny</italic></highlight>., Vol. 67(4), pages 266-273, 1989) via a biotin-avidin bond to prepare a waste water inspecting agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> After that, when the waste water inspecting agent was made in a state of being floated (i.e., a horizontal state) on water surface (aqueous phase) and the pH of the water (aqueous phase) was made alkaline of around 12. Consequently, the &agr;-helix structure in the hydrophilic moiety in the waste water inspecting agent was disentangled to give a random structure. At that time, the hydrophobic moiety of the waste water inspecting agent still maintained its &agr;-helix structure. Then, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) was made acidic to approximately 5. As a result, the hydrophilic moiety of the waste water inspecting agent was made into the &agr;-helix structure again. At that time, when the pushing material attached to the waste water inspecting agent was pushed from the side thereof by the pressure of air to the waste water inspecting agent, the hydrophilic moiety was made into the &agr;-helix structure in the direction orthogonal against water surface in the aqueous phase while the waste water inspecting agent was still in a vertical state to the water (aqueous phase). Then, as mentioned above, when the waste water inspecting agent in an aligned state was pushed onto the substrate (plate) using the pushing material, it was possible to form a monomolecular film where the waste water inspecting agent was vertically stood on the substrate (plate). Incidentally, the above operation was carried out using an LB film forming apparatus (NL-LB 400 NK-MWC; manufactured by Nippon Laser &amp; Electronics Laboratories). Thickness of this monomolecular film was calculated to be about 16 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The resulting substrate in which the monomolecular film comprising the waste water inspecting agent was formed was placed in a solution containing a heavy metal (cadmium) and changes in wavelength by structural color formation were measured using a spectrophotometer in which a significant change in wavelength in the polypeptide was observed as compared with a waste water inspecting agent in which the thioneine-like protein was not bonded to the polypeptide. </paragraph>

The substrate was placed in a solution containing a heavy metal (cadmium) and changes in wavelength by structural color formation were measured by a spectrophotometer in which a significant change in wavelength was observed in the polypeptide as compared to the waste water inspecting agent to which the thioneine-like protein was not bonded. </paragraph>

Then, the quartz oscillation electrode was subjected to a thermal treatment for 20 minutes at the temperature of 110&deg; C. whereby a covalent bond was formed between aminopropyl triethoxysilane and quartz oscillator surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The quartz oscillator was dipped for 1 hour in a 1% by volume aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde to form a covalent bond between glutaraldehyde and aminopropyl triethoxysilane and, nextly, the quartz oscillator was washed by irradiation with ultrasonic wave of 20 kHz for 30 minutes in pure water to remove an excess glutaraldehyde. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The quartz oscillator electrode was dipped for 2 hours in 100 ml of phosphate buffer of pH 7.2 containing the waste water inspecting agent prepared in Example 2. Consequently, the waste water inspecting agent was fixed to the quartz oscillator via glutaraldehyde. Then, unreacted waste water inspecting agent was removed by washing with a phosphate buffer of pH 7.2. </paragraph>

After one minute, changes in the oscillation frequency nearly reached saturation. An object to which the solvent containing the heavy metal (cadmium) was added showed a significant reduction in oscillation frequency as compared to those without adding such solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> It was also observed that, when the added amount of the heavy metal (cadmium) was increased, the oscillation frequency decreased for a certain rate. </paragraph>
