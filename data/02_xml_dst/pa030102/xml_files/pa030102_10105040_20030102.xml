<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a phenolic fraction from fruit and also to the process for obtaining this fraction. This extract rich in an antioxidant compound, phloridzin, can be used as a cosmetic, dietary or nutraceutical preparation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known that polyphenolic compounds are relatively widespread and in large amount in the plant kingdom. In the Rosaceae family in particular, the analysis of the polyphenols of apple has led to the identification of at least 37 phenolic compounds, the most abundant of which are chlorogenic acid, procyanidins B1 and B2, epicatechin, phloretin, phloridzin and p-coumaric acid. Some of these compounds have physiological properties such as antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, antiallergic, anticancer and antidiabetic properties, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are many other polyphenol-rich products on the market, the most common being extracted from green tea, from grape seeds and from pine bark (U.S. Pat. No. 4,698,360, EP A 348 781, EP A 283 349, FR A 1 427 100, FR A 2 092 743, FR A 2 643 073 and FR A 2 372 823). Patent EP A 0 657 169 has already disclosed the extraction of a polyphenolic fraction from unripe fruit (weighing from 3 to 10 grams) of the Rosaceae family. The polyphenolic fraction thus defined is characterized by a high content of derivatives of the hydroxycinnamic acid family (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid), and of molecules from the flavanol family (catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin). Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography of an extract obtained from the juice of unripe fruit shows that phloridzin represents less than 7% by weight of the total phenolic compounds, and dihydrochalcones (phloridzin and phloretin) less than 9%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Among the phenolic compounds, phloretin and its glycosylated derivative, phloridzin, are typical of apple and the other fruit of the Rosaceae family. In particular, phloridzin is found in large amount in the pips, but it is also present in apple juice and skin. Phloridzin has antioxidant activity allowing a cardiovascular protection similar to that of estrogens. Moreover, phloridzin is capable of acting on melanogenesis by activating a cascade of enzymes including tyrosinase, thus allowing increased protection against ultraviolet radiation. Phloridzin also has antidiabetic action by competitive inhibition of the sodium-dependent blood transport of metabolites such as glucose, galactose and the like. Phloridzin is also involved in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells by blocking the activity of protein kinase C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in apple (homogenate or juice), the dihydrochalcones (phloretin and phloridzin) are present in small amount relative to the other polyphenols. Chlorogenic acid and the procyanidins are the major polyphenols in apples, whether these are cider apples or dessert apples, phloridzin and phloretin never representing more than 5% by weight of the total polyphenols of ripe cider apples (analysis of 15 different varieties) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the known polyphenolic extracts, the proportions between the various phenolic molecules are conserved relative to the proportions present in the various starting materials, with the exception of the polymeric procyanidins, which are lost or degraded during the extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Polyphenolic extracts rich in hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and coumaric acid) and in flavanols (catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins), and poor in dihydrochalcones (phloridzin and phloretin) are thus conventionally obtained (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>).

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The polyphenolic fraction in accordance with the invention comprises at least 20% by weight of polyphenols and preferably 50%, at least 10% by weight of which is composed of phloridzin, and preferably between 10% and 70%. This extract can also comprise in its composition chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, procyanidin B2, quercitrin, p-coumaric acid and also phloretin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> One composition that is particularly preferred of this polyphenolic fraction is that it contains, by weight: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> more than 20% and preferably more than 50% of total polyphenols; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> at least 30% and preferably from 30% to 40% by weight of the polyphenols as phloridzin; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> not more than 11% and preferably between 2% and 11% by weight of the polyphenols as chlorogenic acid; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> not more than 4% of the polyphenols as epicatechin; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> not more than 2% of the polyphenols as procyanidin B2; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> not more than 1.5% of the polyphenols as quercitrin; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> not more than 0.4% of the polyphenols as p-coumaric acid; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> less than 0.2% of the polyphenols as caffeic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another subject of the invention is that the caffeic acid is present in weight proportions of less than 20% of the weight of phloridzin present. Preferably, the caffeic acid represents less than 1% by weight of the total polyphenols in the extracts. The proportion of phloridzin is 9 times as great by weight as that of the catechin. The amount of phloridzin present is at least equivalent by weight to that of the chlorogenic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another subject of the invention is characterized in that it contains phloretin. By means of a controlled acid hydrolysis, virtually all of the phloridzin can be converted into phloretin, which is less water-soluble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another subject is characterized in that the dihydrochalcones are present in proportions of greater than or equal to 40% by weight relative to the hydroxycinnamic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The extraction process for selectively extracting a dihydrochalcone-rich polyphenolic fraction from ripe apples is characterized in that it comprises the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> the crushed apples are subjected to one or more solid/liquid extractions, in the presence or absence of added water; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the wet solid extract obtained is then either dried or enzymatically liquefied to obtain a liquid extract; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> the dry solid extract undergoes further extractions over a period of between 10 minutes and 2 hours with a polar organic solvent, preferably a C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>aliphatic alcohol, pure or as a mixture with water, to obtain an organic extract; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> this organic extract is evaporated to dryness at a temperature of less than or equal to 60&deg; C., preferably under reduced pressure; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> this residue is then taken up in water, after which it is depleted several times, preferably 4 times, with a water-immiscible solvent, preferably ethyl acetate or methyl or propyl acetate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> the organic solutions obtained are mixed together and evaporated to dryness at a temperature of less than 60&deg; C., and preferably less than 50&deg; C., to obtain the polyphenolic fraction which is the subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Via another route, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> the wet solid extract is mixed with water in the presence of an enzymatic mixture for a period of between 1 and 4 hours at a temperature of between 30 and 50&deg; C., and preferably between 40 and 45&deg; C., to obtain a liquid extract; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> this liquid extract is clarified by centrifugation or by filtration and then by ultrafiltration; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> the extract is loaded onto a chromatography column filled with an adsorbent resin of styrene-divinylbenzene type. The resin is washed with acidified water to remove the impurities and the residual sugars. The polyphenols are then eluted with an aqueous-alcoholic solution containing between 40% and 70% and preferably between 50% and 60% by weight of ethanol. Other C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>aliphatic alcohols may be used, such as methanol or butanol; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> if necessary, a dewaxing step is introduced during the process; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> the product obtained by extraction is taken up a final time in water and then dried, preferably by atomization or lyophilization to give a beige-colored powder containing at least 20% by weight of polyphenols, preferably more than 50% of polyphenols, 10% by weight of which, and preferably between 10% and 70% of the polyphenols are dihydrochalcones, preferably phloridzin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The fractions are obtained by the process described above, preferably from ripe apples of the Rosaceae family and in particular of the species <highlight><italic>Malus sylvestris </italic></highlight>Mill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This extract of eating apples having the characteristics stated, obtained according to the process described above, may be used as a dietary or nutraceutical supplement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The dihydrochalcone-rich phenolic fraction according to the invention has properties as an agent for protecting against ultraviolet radiation, and has antioxidant properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A subject of the invention is also a cosmetic composition comprising, inter alia, the dihydrochalcone-rich polyphenolic fraction described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The compositions according to the invention may be ingested or applied to the skin. According to the mode of administration, the composition according to the invention may be in any form usually used in cosmetics. </paragraph>

It has the characteristic of being poor in acids of the hydroxycinnamic family, and more particularly in chlorogenic acid. It is also poor in acids of the flavanol family (catechins, epicatechins, procyanidins B 1, B2, etc.), which leads to an original phenolic profile that is entirely different from those described for apple, and entirely different from a phenolic profile obtained by a standard process using ripe apples. </paragraph>

This method uses the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (reference 9001, Merck). Briefly, this reagent consists of a mixture of phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid, which is reduced during the oxidation of the phenols to a mixture of blue oxides of tungsten and of molybdenum.

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The measurement of the free-radical-scavenging activity of the polyphenolic extracts was performed by the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method described by Brand-Williams et al. (1995) and Lu and Foo (2000), slightly modified. Brand-Williams W., Cuvelier M. E. &amp; Berset C.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The principle is that of measuring the residual amount of DPPH&deg;, a colored radical that is stable under the operating conditions and whose concentration decreases during an incubation in the presence of antioxidant extracts under standardized conditions.

The antioxidant activity is expressed relative to the activity of a reference molecule, Trolox&reg;, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (a water-soluble vitamin E analog). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> 6 mg of DPPH&deg; were carefully dissolved in 100 ml of an aqueous methanol solution at 75 vol %. In parallel, a precise amount of sample to be analyzed and 18 mg of Trolox&reg; were dissolved in 25 ml of 75% methanolic solution. 2 ml of DPPH&deg; solution were incubated with 25 &mgr;l of solution to be measured at a temperature of 37&plusmn;0.5&deg; C. in leaktight flasks for 6 hours.

<heading lvl="1">Free-Radical-Scavenging Effects of Powdered Polyphenolic Fractions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The genotoxicity of a substance is defined as its capacity to generate lesions on genomic or plasmid DNA. The genotoxic agents may be of exogenous nature (ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, chemical substances, etc.) or of endogenous nature (free radicals produced by cell metabolism, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The free-radical-scavenging effects of the phloridzin-rich polyphenolic fractions obtained according to the process of the invention were measured in vitro by the &ldquo;3D&rdquo; test (Damaged DNA Detection, Analytical Biochemistry, (1995), pp. 37-42). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The principle is based on repairing DNA lesions, the damaged DNA being used as a marker of protective efficacy of the test molecules with respect to free OH&deg; radicals: the reduction in lesions observed on the DNA is correlated with the trapping of the free radicals. During the regeneration step, a label (biotin-labeled nucleotide) is incorporated into the DNA and this incorporation, a quantitative indication of the number of repaired lesions, is then revealed by chemiluminescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> This test carried out on plasmid DNA allows the detection of genotoxic agents at the early stage of the lesion-mutation-cancerization process. Molecules or mixtures with antioxidant or free-radical-scavenging properties, which can thus protect a human cell from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygenated species (ROSs), can thus be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The protocol was as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> the target DNA was adsorbed onto sensitized wells and then incubated with genotoxic agents in the presence or absence of the polyphenolic extract to be tested (dissolved in an ethanol solution at 2% or in DMSO) or in the presence of catechin (control). In this test, the OH&deg; radical produced by homolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide was used as DNA-damaging genotoxic agent. The hydrogen peroxide was added to the wells, which were then irradiated with UVB rays (700 J/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). Furthermore, a positive repair control consisting of a plasmid DNA predamaged with ultraviolet C radiation was added; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> a step of washing with ultrapure water and then with a dioxane solution at 20% in ultrapure water for 5 minutes at 30&deg; C. with gentle stirring made it possible to remove the non-specific interactions between the sample and the test, due to the presence of macromolecules such as proteins that may interfere with the repair signal; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> a repair step was performed in the presence of purified cell extracts (which contain the active enzymes of the various DNA lesion repair pathways) and of biotin-coupled modified nucleotides (dUTP). The repair of the lesions involved a phase of excision of the lesions followed by a resynthesis of the DNA fragment or of excised bases. During the repair synthesis step, the modified nucleotides were thus incorporated into the DNA; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> a step of recognition of the sites for binding the nucleotides to the DNA by binding to the biotin carried by the nucleotides, an avidin molecule coupled to a peroxidase molecule; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> a step of revealing the reaction by adding a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate. The light signal observed and read on the luminometer was proportional to the amount of lesions repaired. A dose effect was observed in the limit from 1 to 15 lesions per 6 kilobases, this being the case for most of the lesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The percentage of protection observed in the presence of ROSs was calculated as the relative reduction of the lesional effect due to the OH&deg; species, that is to say: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>% protection&equals;&lcub;&lsqb;RLU oxidant&minus;RLU (oxidant&plus;sample)&rsqb;/RLU oxidant&rcub;&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> where RLU&equals;relative light units (arbitrary units of quantity of light). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The specific percentage of protection was corrected by the percentage of non-specific inhibition measured on the samples predamaged with UVC. It is an indication of the free-radical-scavenging activity due to the only added extracts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>is the concentration in mg/ml of test product which gives 50% protective activity against the genotoxic agent OH&deg;. The lower the value, the greater the antioxidant activity of the test product.

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The three samples have a protective effect with regard to the formation of lesions on DNA by the OH&deg; radicals. They thus have excellent free-radical-scavenging activity, greater than that of epicatechin and very much greater than that of catechin, the two reference molecules that are themselves recognized for their good free-radical-scavenging capacity. A dose-response effect is visible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The concentrations giving 50% of protective effects are low: about 5 times less of 50% of polyphenolic extract than of catechin is needed for the same level of protection, and about 50 times less of extract containing 90% of phloridzin-rich polyphenols is needed. Low concentrations of polyphenolic extracts as described in the invention are sufficient to result in a marked decrease in the lesional effect of the free radicals. The polyphenolic fractions according to the invention are thus powerful free-radical-scavenging agents which protect DNA in vitro against the genotoxic effects of the OH&deg; radical. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The antioxidant effects of the phloridzin-rich polyphenolic fractions obtained according to the process of the invention were measured on plasmid DNA according to the &ldquo;3D&rdquo; test principle described previously. The methodology is the same, the only difference being that, in this test, the genotoxic agent which damages the DNA is singlet oxygen <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>produced by illuminating methylene blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The principle is based on repairing DNA lesions, the damaged DNA being used as a marker of the protective efficacy of various molecules with respect to singlet oxygen <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The anti-ultraviolet protective role of the phloridzin-rich polyphenolic fractions according to the invention was measured on plasmid DNA according to the in vitro &ldquo;3D&rdquo; test principle described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The principle is based on measuring the amount of lesions suffered by the DNA, the damaged DNA being used as a marker of the protective efficacy of test molecules with respect to ultraviolet radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The potentially photo-protective products to be tested were diluted in pure ethanol or ultrapure water and then deposited on an ultraviolet-transparent plate. This plate was then superimposed on that containing the adsorbed plasmid DNA. The assembly was irradiated with ultraviolet B rays at a power of 50 KJ/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The reference product used was a commercial product recognized for its protective action against ultraviolet radiation, Parsol&reg; MCX (2-methylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate) from Roche. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A non-specific inhibition (in the absence of ultraviolet radiation) of the repair signal is not possible in this test, since the test product is not in direct contact with the adsorbed DNA at any time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Although less photo-protective than Parsol&reg; MCX, the polyphenolic extracts nevertheless show large anti-ultraviolet B activity. </paragraph>
