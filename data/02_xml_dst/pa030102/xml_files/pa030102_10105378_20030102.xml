<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> scanning unit includes a pickup roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for separating documents one by one from a cassette, a document sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for sensing a picked-up document, a pickup roller gear <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for transmitting power to pickup roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a scan position sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for detecting the entrance of the picked-up document, a read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for reading data from the document in response to scan position sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for maintaining a constant feeding speed and pressure on the document against read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the document is read, a white roller gear <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for transmitting power to white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a discharge roller for discharging the document outside the scanning unit after the document has been read by read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a discarding roller gear <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for transmitting power to discharging roller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Each gear <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is driven by the power transmitted through gear trains <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are driven by a driving gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is connected with a motor (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a document is placed on a cassette having a document feeder in a sending facsimile, a user inputs a telephone number of a receiving facsimile. If the sending and receiving facsimiles are connected through a telecommunication line, the pickup roller I picks up documents one by one in response to a start command signal. A picked-up document is consecutively sensed by sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In response to each signal generated from sensors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> reads data from the documents that pass through white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> along a feeding path. Continuously, white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> transfers the read documents to discharge roller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Discharge roller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> discharges the documents outside the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, when the document is picked up and transferred into the scanning unit, the document may be misaligned with the feeding path due to a mechanical problem or due to a user&apos;s mistake. Therefore, pickup roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shakes, and pickup roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are not aligned with each other along the feeding path. In this case, the document transferred to read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is misaligned and deviated from the feeding path. The document may be deformed by friction force between read module <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and white roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, data read from the document becomes incorrect, and the incomplete data is transmitted to the receiving facsimile. It is disadvantage that the document is deformed and that the data may not be read correctly from the deformed document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an apparatus for feeding documents in a facsimile including a pickup roller for picking up documents one by one, a white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a power transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is disposed in order on a transfer passage of the documents. Pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rotates by power transmitted from driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a pickup roller gear <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A document sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed in a proximity of pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Document sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> senses the entrance of the document picked up by pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In addition, a scan position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is installed between pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Scan position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> senses the entrance of the document. Signals generated from sensors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are transmitted to controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In response to the signal from sensors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the document is ready to be read or scanned in a predetermined period of time after the document is sensed by sensors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> White roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is disposed at a lower part of scan position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. White roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is installed to face a read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for reading data from the document. Read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> reads data from the document in accordance with a driving signal of the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. White roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> rotates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the power from driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a white roller gear <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is coaxially coupled with white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> discharges the document which has passed through white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> outside a document reading system. Discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> rotates by the power from driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through a discharge roller gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is coaxially coupled with discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Power transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may either transfer the power of driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> only to pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or simultaneously transfer the power of driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to each roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Power transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled by controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In other words, power transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled to transfer the power only to pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> until a front end of the document picked up by pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> contacts white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, even if the document enters being misaligned, the front end of the document is aligned with the transfer passage by white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> since the document is advanced toward white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for a predetermined period of time by pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When the document is aligned, power transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> simultaneously transmits the power to rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and rotates rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> simultaneously.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> From now on, the operation of the apparatus for feeding documents in a facsimile constructed according to the principles of the present invention is described in greater detail as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> First of all, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> user sets up the document on the cassette, when first swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is connected with major gear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of third gear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then, the user selects a start button when the sending facsimile is connected with the receiving facsimile. After that, driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is driven by controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to rotate driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in an &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction. Next, the power of driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is transmitted to pickup roller gear <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> a of pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through idle gear <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, first swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and third gear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Therefore, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rotates to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction by the power transmitted to pickup roller gear <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>At this time, second swing gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> idles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> picks up documents one by one, and a document enters the transfer passage of the facsimile. Document sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generates a first sensing signal to controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> after sensing the entrance of the document. In addition, scan position sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> continuously senses the entered document and generates a second sensing signal representing information about a read position of the document to controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In response to the second sensing signal from sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is rotated in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction for a predetermined period of time. Then, the document picked up enters the transfer passage but cannot advance its way due to a friction force between white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In other words, since white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are stopped, the document stalls between white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. At this time, even if the document is entered and conveyed as it is misaligned, the document is stopped on the transfer passage when the front end of the document contacts the white w roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the rest of the document is continuously forced to be advanced toward white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the document can be aligned properly in line with the transfer passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> controls driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to rotate only for a predetermined period of time after receiving the signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. After the predetermined period of time, controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> drives driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a &ldquo;B&rdquo; direction. Then, driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is rotated in the &ldquo;B&rdquo; direction. Moreover, each swing gears <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> connected with idle gear <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> rotate in the &ldquo;B&rdquo; direction, and the swing arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction about idle gear <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, first swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is separated from third gear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and connected with second gear <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>b. In addition, second swing gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is connected with fourth gear <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Therefore, white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is rotated by the power transmitted through first swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, second gear <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and white roller gear <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Moreover, discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is rotated by the power transmitted through second swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, second gear <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>first gear <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and discharge roller gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotated by the power transmitted through second swing gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, fourth gear <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, third gear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and pickup roller gear <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rotates regardless of the position of the documents. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotated by the power transmitted from first swing gear <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> when pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> picks up the document. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotated by the power transmitted from second swing gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> when the data on the documents is read by read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and when the documents are transferred by white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. White roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are rotated only after the documents are aligned. Thus, the aligned documents pass through read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by a rotation force of white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. At this time, read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> reads the data from the documents. Then, the documents are discharged outside the document reading apparatus through discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> after being read by read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As described above, the documents are aligned with the transfer passage and transferred by driving gear <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction and the &ldquo;B&rdquo; direction repeatedly. Thus, even if the documents are picked up being misaligned with the transfer passage, the misaligned documents are compensated to be aligned with the transfer passage before being transferred to read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it can be prevented that the incorrect and distorted data is transferred to the receiving facsimile. </paragraph>

Therefore, the power of driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is transmitted to white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, idle gear <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, second swing gear <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, sixth gear <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, seventh gear <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and white roller gear <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>a. Accordingly, all of the pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> simultaneously rotate and transfer the documents as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG.5</cross-reference>. In other words, if the rotational direction of driving gear <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is changed into the &ldquo;A&rdquo; direction or the &ldquo;B&rdquo; direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the misaligned document may be compensated while passing through read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the rotation of white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may accurately read the data from the document passing therethrough. The document passed through white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is discharged outside the document reading system by discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, when the data on a plurality of documents is transmitted, the falling document is picked up consecutively before a previously picked-up document read by read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is completely discharged. For this end, the controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> controls driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to change the rotational direction of after the picked up the document is passed through white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Then, swing gear unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> returns to the position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and only pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are rotated. In this status of swing gear unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and driving unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> picks up a new document and feeds the document into the transfer passage formed between white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> discharges the document read by read module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> outside the document reading system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, when a user wants to send data of a plurality of documents, the picking-up, the aligning, and the discharging of each document may be performed independently simultaneously. Accordingly, it can be prevented that the document to be read is deformed and that the discharged documents are overlapped and shuffled without being stacked in order, and thus the credibility of the product is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to the apparatus for feeding documents in a facsimile, discharge roller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and white roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be selectively driven and stopped by rotating the pickup roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the document misaligned from the transfer passage is picked up, the misaligned document may be corrected and the credibility of the sending data to be sent from the sending facsimile to the receiving facsimile is improved. </paragraph>
