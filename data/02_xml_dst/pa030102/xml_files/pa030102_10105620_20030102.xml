<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to dispensers, in particular dispenser for storing and selectively dispensing one or more products. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The use of spray bottles for dispensing chemical reagents (e.g., water, cleaners, soaps, insecticides, hair spray, etc.) are well known. Due to regulations limiting the amount of volatile organic carbons (VOC.) released in the atmosphere, products originally contained and dispensed through aerosols are currently being replaced with spray bottles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Bottlers of chemical reagents typically market their products by purchasing separately empty plastic container bottles and spray heads. The bottlers then fill, assemble, and label the completed spray bottle packages for delivery to retailers. Consumers purchase the filled spray bottles at the point-of-sale, and then use the chemical contents of the spray bottle. Most consumers dispose of the spray bottle upon the one time use of the contents of the spray bottles. However, the spray bottles are still fully functional with respect to containing and dispensing chemical reagents, since the plastic bottles are substantially chemically resistant and the spray heads remain fully functional after using the contents. Conventional point-of-sale type spray bottles can be recharged numerous times with chemical concentrate and water (i.e., at least 10 times, possibly 100 times while maintaining full operation). Thus, consumers dispose of large quantities of reusable product (i.e, empty spray bottles) having high utility value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In today&apos;s environment of numerous regulations to control pollution, and consumer and industrial awareness for conserving resources and reducing landfill waste, it is highly desirable to promote the reuse of products that maintain their utility, and dispose of only products that no longer have any utility. Many bottlers are currently selling concentrate in various sized containers to allow consumers to recharge point-of-sale type spray bottles with their particular concentrates. However, many consumers are unwilling to adopt such methods apparently due to some inconvenience in the steps involved with the recharging process of the spray bottles. In particular, there is some inconvenience in removing the spray head, opening the chemical concentrate container, pouring the chemical concentrate into the empty spray bottle, adding water, and reattaching the spray head to the bottle. Further, consumers apparently lack interest in recharging spray bottles due to some reluctance based on their inexperience and knowledge in mixing and diluting liquids, which is done by processing chemists for the bottlers. In addition, recharging is usually a messy undertaking due to spillage of chemical concentrate while pouring from one container to the other, overfilling, accidentally knocking over the bottle being filled due to its instability when unfilled, and other undesirable mishaps that can occur, that provide substantial inconveniences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Importantly, sizeable containers (e.g., pint, quart, gallon, liter sizes) of chemical concentrate can be significantly hazardous to transport and handle by consumers unaware of the potent chemical properties of the chemical concentrates. Specifically, chemical spills of concentrate can damage items around the home including flooring, carpeting, counter top in kitchens and bathrooms, shelves, and other items the chemical concentrate could potentially come into contact with. Further, chemical concentrate can impose a significantly greater health risk to persons coming into accidental contact therewith potentially causing tissue burns and other damages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Most importantly, chemical concentrate imposes a great risk to children who may accidentally ingest the chemical concentrate and become poisoned. Chemical concentrate greatly increases the chance of permanent injury or death in this regard to children versus current diluted chemical reagents contained in point-of-sale type spray bottles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The dispensers, container, lids and seals according to the present invention, in particular the cartridges or inserts, can serve as packaging for many types of products. These dispensers provide the advantage of storing and dispensing multiple similar products or multiple different products. There advantages will be described herein below. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A first object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable dispenser, in particular a spray bottle dispenser having one or more chemical concentrate reservoirs associated with the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A second object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable dispenser, in particular a spray bottle dispenser having one or more chemical concentrate reservoirs disposed with the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A third object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable dispenser, in particular a spray bottle having one or more chemical concentrate reservoirs disposed within the spray bottle dispenser, and accessible by bursting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable dispenser, in particular a spray bottle having one or more chemical concentrate reservoirs disposed within the spray bottle dispenser, and accessible by puncturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> These and other objects can be achieved by the rechargeable dispenser, in particular the spray bottle dispenser according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The main concept according to the present invention is to provide a rechargeable dispenser, in particular a spray bottle dispenser package having at least one supply of chemical to allow the spray bottle dispenser to be recharged at least one time. The chemical can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semi-solid or solid. Specifically, the chemical liquid can be a one phase mixture, a two phase mixture, a dispersion or any other chemical reagent having liquid characteristics. The chemical semi-solid can be in the form of a slurry, paste, solid dispersed in a liquid that still exhibits some liquid type characteristics, and the solid can be in the form of a powder, granules, tablet or other solid material form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The chemical is preferably a concentrated chemical that is readily diluted with a solvent, in particular plain water. Preferably, the chemical can be immediately diluted, however, a chemical substance that can go into solution over a 24 hour or longer period of time can potentially be suitable for some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the present invention involve associating at least one quantity of chemical with the spray bottle dispenser itself. Specifically, the chemical is stored in some manner, and connected directly internally or externally to the spray bottle dispenser. However, the present invention is broader in scope to include packaging the chemical and spray bottle dispenser together (i.e., connected indirectly) to be marketed at the point-of-sale. In this embodiment of the invention, a consumer would purchase the package containing a supply of chemical and the spray bottle dispenser, separate at home the spray bottle dispenser that has been filled by the bottler from the package and store the chemical portion of the package separate from the spray bottle dispenser in the household. The user would then retrieve the stored chemical upon consuming the initial contents of the spray bottle dispenser for purposes of recharging the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention store the at least one quantity of chemical directly or indirectly inside or outside the spray bottle dispenser. In the case of an indirect connection to the spray bottle dispenser, a mechanical fastener such as a plastic strip connects an external chemical reservoir to the spray bottle dispenser. In the case of a direct connection, the chemical reservoir is directly connected internally or externally to the spray bottle dispenser. The most preferred embodiments store the at least one quantity of chemical inside the spray bottle dispenser, particularly the bottle portion, to fully contain any inadvertent spills or leakage of chemical through the life of the spray bottle dispenser. These most preferred embodiments provide substantial advantages for handling, recharging and protecting household items from contact with chemical, and most importantly to prevent accidental ingestion by children. This particular point is especially important due to the much greater potency of chemical concentrate versus diluted chemical reagents currently being sold by bottlers at point-of-sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The most preferred embodiments also utilize conventional spray bottle dispenser components including plastic bottles, plastic spray heads, and plastic downtubes. In order to promote products incorporating the present invention, it is particularly important to utilize the standard components that are readily available and relatively inexpensive due to the large quantities sold and consumed. Thus, an add-on chemical reservoir for storing the chemical is highly desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The most preferred add-on type chemical reservoir is an insert received within the bottle portion of the spray bottle dispenser. This type of insert can be manufactured extremely cheaply in high volume while providing all the performance characteristics necessary for a safe and reliable product. Specifically, the insert can be made with one or more chambers or cells containing chemical that can be accessed in various ways. For example, the reservoir can be sealed with membranes that can be punctured with an instrument, in particular the tip of the downtube. Alternatively, the walls of the chemical reservoir can be designed or configured so as to be readily bursted upon application of external pressure to the chemical reservoir. Adding lines of weaknesses, thinning of walls and other means for locally weakening a portion of the chemical reservoir can be implemented for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, one or more of the components of the conventional spray bottle dispenser (e.g., bottle portion, spray head portion, downtube) can be modified to provide the chemical reservoir. For example, the walls or bottom of the bottle portion can be modified, by molding a chemical reservoir in one or more sides or bottom of the bottle portion, the spray head portion can be provided with a chemical reservoir, and/or the downtube can be provided with an add-on chemical reservoir or the walls of the downtube can be molded to provide a chemical reservoir. However, all of these approaches will initially be substantially greater in cost due to the modification of conventional components not necessitated by the use of an insert according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The insert according to the present invention can take on many different forms and configurations. A first preferred embodiment of the insert is defined by a cylinder having one or more chambers or cells disposed therein. The interior of the cylinder can be provided with one or more bisecting walls to define the chambers along the length thereof. A plastic cylinder having one or more bisecting walls can be easily extruded in plastic. The top and bottom of the one or more chambers of the insert are sealed by upper and lower sealing membranes. The membranes can be films, foils, composites of films and foils, or any other suitable composite that is both chemically resistant and subject to being punctured readily by an instrument, in particular, the tip of the downtube, or can be made to burst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The upper and lower sealing membranes can be connected to the insert by bonding, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding, sonic welding, or suitable methods for forming a liquid tight seal (e.g., hermetic seal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the insert can be marketed inside a filled spray bottle dispenser at point-of-sale. The downtube extends through an open chamber of this insert down into the lower portion of the bottle portion to access premixed chemical reagent added by the bottler during manufacture. After consumption of the chemical reagent, a user unscrews the spray head and lifts the downtube from the bottle portion. The insert is rotated so that one chemical reservoir is now positioned where the open chamber was previously positioned (i.e., now registered for being punctured by the downtube). The user then forces the tip of the downtube through the upper sealing membrane, down through the chamber, and then punctures the lower sealing membrane. Water can be added through the open chamber of the insert before or after the step of accessing the chemical reservoir by puncturing with the downtube. This configuration allows the chemical to be always stored within the confines of the spray bottle dispenser, and minimizes the steps needed for recharging the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The consumer will experience little inconvenience in removing the sprayhead and downtube from the bottle portion, rotating the insert, puncturing the chemical reservoir, adding water through the open chamber of the insert, and reassembling the spray head portion to the bottle portion. Further, the chemical concentrate stored within the insert is extremely safe for handling and preventing accidental consumption by children (i.e., a child would have to successfully unscrew the spray head portion from the bottle portion, fully remove the downtube from the bottle portion, and successfully puncture the insert). Further, even in the event of puncture of the insert by a child, the access opening through the upper sealing membrane would be sufficiently small to substantially limit spilling and containing most chemical from being easily ingested by a child. Thus, the present invention provides substantial safeguards over current methods of selling large quantities of chemical concentrate at the point-of-sale, and subsequently having the consumer handle and mix the chemical concentrate in his or her home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This particular insert can have one, two, three, four or more separate chambers or cells. For example, in the case of four cells, one cell would be an open cell through which the downtube is initially placed by the bottler during assembly when the spray bottle dispenser is provided with an initial charge of diluted chemical. Thus, in this example, there remains three cells that can be utilized as three separate chemical reservoirs. This four cell configuration would allow the user to initially consume the premixed diluted chemical reagents of the spray bottle dispenser, and then recharge the spray bottle dispenser three more times prior to consuming all the chemical contained in the spray bottle dispenser. If the consumer then disposed of the spray bottle dispenser at that point, this would provide a three time improvement over the current practice of consumers utilizing a spray bottle dispenser one time prior to disposal. Thus, the consumption of spray bottle dispensers could be reduced three-fold (i.e., one fourth the waste) if fully implements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> However, this invention can even provide for an even greater improvement over the current practices by consumers. Specifically, this insert can also be sold at the point-of-sale as a separate item that could be added to a conventional point-of-sale type spray bottle dispensers having no inserts after the initial consumption of the contents, or for use with spray bottle dispensers having inserts according to the present invention after the complete chemical consumption of the inserts initially sold with the units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This new system would greatly decrease the shipping weight and costs associated therewith, decrease retail shelf space for marketing the product, and most importantly greatly decrease the consumption and waste of plastic material. Specifically, the volume of plastic needed to make the four chamber insert described above would be a small fraction compared with the weight of four conventional spray bottle dispensers based on equal amounts of useable diluted chemical reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, conventional spray bottle dispensers are substantially much greater in cost to produce relative to the insert according to the present invention, and would conserve significant labor and other direct and indirect costs associated with the production of conventional spraybottle dispenser components versus the insert according to the present invention. Further, the insert according to the present invention can readily be recycled, and could potentially be refilled if an adequate system were developed to reprocess such inserts, however, more than likely the inserts would be disposed of by consumers based on convenience factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of an insert according to the present invention involves forming a strip of chemical reservoirs that can be disposed within the bottle portion of the spray bottle dispenser. The strip of chemical reservoirs can be made at high speed, and would most likely be made in a continuous strip and cut to length when completed for insulation in each spray bottle dispenser. The strip type insert can be manufactured by a high speed molding technique such as vacuum forming the chemical reservoirs from a plastic strip, filling the chemical reservoirs with chemical, and sealing the chemical reservoirs. This completed strip is then cut to length based on the number of reservoirs to be added to the spray bottle dispenser, and is preferably attached by adhesive or other technique to the inside surface of the bottle portion. The chemical reservoirs made of the plastic strip are made in such a manner that the chemical reservoirs can be punctured by an instrument, in particular, the tip of the downtube, or can be made to burst by adding external pressure to the chemical reservoir. A user can burst one or more (i.e. one, two, three, etc.) of the chemical reservoirs to specifically tailor the concentration of the diluted chemical reagent. Thus, the present invention allows the consumer some latitude in selecting concentration levels currently unavailable with conventional spray bottle dispensers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment, a plurality of separate cylindrical chemical reservoirs can be added to the inside of the bottom portion. The cylinder chemical reservoirs are provided with upper sealing membrane that can be punctured by an instrument, in particular the tip of the downtube. The cylinder reservoirs can be separate units or connected together by a strip, or by some other manner. The cylindrical chemical reservoirs are, preferably located at the bottom wall of the bottom portion to allow easy access by the tip of the downtube during a puncturing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a fourth embodiment, cylindrical chemical reservoirs bridge the side walls of the bottle portion. The cylinder reservoirs are made so they can be burst by simply pressing together the walls at the location of the particular cylinder reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a fifth embodiment, separate donut-shaped chemical reservoirs are added to a conventional downtube. The donut-shaped reservoirs can be made so as to be punctured or burst for chemical access. Alternatively, one or more small holes through the inner surface of the donut-shaped reservoirs can be provided and sealed by the downtube itself (adhesive can also be provided to insure adequate sealing). In this type of arrangement, the chemical inside the donut-shaped reservoir can be accessed by simply pulling the donut-shaped chemical reservoir off the downtube exposing the opening through the inner wall of the donut-shaped reservoir. The donut-shaped reservoir can be removed by unscrewing the spray head portion from the bottle portion, lifting the downtube until the lowermost donut-shaped reservoir is located at or near the opening of the bottle portion, holding the donut-shaped reservoir by the fingertips of one hand at the opening to the bottle portion, and then lifting with the other hand the downtube so as to detach the donut-shaped reservoir from the downtube, and then allowing the donut-shaped reservoir to drop into the bottle. Water is added before or after to dilute the concentrate to form the diluted chemical reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a sixth embodiment, an insert is provided with a plurality of reservoirs in a stepped and stacked array. The top reservoir is thinner and deeper compared with a bottom reservoir that is wider and shallower. One or more reservoirs having dimensions in between that of the top and bottom reservoirs can be provided therebetween. This stepped and stacked arrangement allows easy access to any of the chemical reservoirs by an instrument, in particular the tip of the downtube for puncturing a membrane sealing each reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a seventh embodiment, a plurality of reservoirs are provided in an insert and a stacked arrangement. Each reservoir is sealed at the top and bottom with a sealing membrane. A person using a spray bottle dispenser containing this insert initially punctures the upper and lower sealing membrane of the upper reservoir during a first recharging operation, punctures the upper and lower sealing membranes of the middle reservoir to access chemical in the middle reservoir during a second recharging operation, and does the same to the third chemical reservoir in the third recharging operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a container configured for containing product. The container includes multiple compartments that can be configured to be simultaneously accessed or selectively accessed. A seal is connected to the container for sealing the compartments, and a closure is connected to the container. Preferably, the closure covers and protects the seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The seal can be defined by a single piece configured to be selectively separated into separate seal portions. For example, a single seal can be provided with lines of perforation and/or lines of weakness to allow tearing between adjacent sealed portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The sealed portions can be provided with separate pull tabs to allow the seal to be separated into separate sealed portions. Alternatively, the seal can be defined by separate sealed portions that are applied to the container as separate portions and/or separated from each other due to a cutting operation (e.g. for example by use of a dye). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a removable cap (e.g. screw off or snap cap) is used to cover and protect the seal connected to the container for sealing the separate compartments of the container. The separate seal portions, as an option, can be each provided with a separate pull tab. The separate sections of the seal, for example, can be selectively removed by a user gripping the pull tab and removing that particular section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The seal can be a washer, membrane, wall portion, separate container, bag, wrap, foil, matrix, composite material, or any device configured to provide additional packaging to prevent leakage, provide an air tight environment to promote freshness and shelf life and stability of the substance(s) or product(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The dispenser or container according to the present invention, can be a stand alone dispenser or container, or preferably is utilized as an insert within another container, in particular for use as a rechargeable dispenser. A user can selectively access substance or product contained within one of the compartments of the container to be added to another container, and for example, be mixed with a diluent such as water. In some embodiments, the insert can remain within another container while accessing the separate compartments, and in other embodiments the insert is removed from another container, one of the seals is selectively accessed and the contents poured into another container, and then the container is reinstalled into another container. In this manner, a user can selectively access product stored for later use in another container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The dispensers according to the present invention can be utilized as stand alone type containers or packages for storing and dispensing a wide variety of products. In preferred embodiments, the dispensers according to the present invention utilize multiple chambers or reservoirs, which preferably are selectively accessible so that product from one chamber can be removed while products in other chambers can continue to be stored as the one product is dispensed. Alternatively, two or more products can be dispensed simultaneously in some embodiments with or without selective access to additional products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The products to be stored and dispensed with the dispensers according to the present invention include chemicals, pharmaceuticals, beverages, food, candy, utilitarian objects such as matches, toothpicks, pins, needles, hairpins, paperclips, and potentially thousands of other products. The products can be liquid, fluid, gas, solid, powder, slurry, paste, gel, or a wide variety of other types of products. Preferably, the products are flowable such as liquids, powders and/or particulates to facilitate dispensing of these types of products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the dispensers according to the present invention include a multiple-chamber component made as a single piece or integral unit. For example, this component is made as a single piece plastic injection molded article to reduce assembly and the cost of making such an article in high volume. More preferred embodiments of the dispensers according to the present invention include a multiple chamber component or container having a depth greater than a width thereof. In some of these more preferred embodiments, the height is significantly greater than the width of this particular component. In a most preferred embodiment thereof, the component has multiple chambers accessible from the top of the container, and is split into multiple chambers by one or more partitioning or dividing wall portions of the container. A particularly preferred embodiment utilizes a substantially cylinder or cup-shaped outer wall portion having one or more dividing wall portions to provide equally sized and shaped multiple compartments accessible from the top of the container. Preferably, this type of container includes an upper lip portion for a variety of various applications and combinations with closures. This particular embodiment allows for the use of a substantially cylindrical shaped closure (e.g. snap cap, threaded cap, lid, etc.), which allows for a tight and evenly distributed seal around the perimeter thereof with the cylindrical or cup-shaped container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the containers according to the present invention, the top wall portions and/or bottom wall portions can provide access to the multiple compartments or chambers within the container. In some applications, these wall portions are defined by sealing membranes (e.g. heat sealed and/or inductive sealed to the plastic injection molded container), or are openable, breakable or frangible wall portions of the plastic injection molded container itself. In some preferred embodiments, the membranes are provided with an additional protective seal or cap so as to prevent damage or inadvertent opening of the container during shipping, handling and/or storing. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, the product is doubly, triply or even more packaged to prevent leakage, decomposition of the products, oxidation, protection of the product to provide long shelf life and stability of the product contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In some of the most preferred embodiments, the multiple chamber or compartment container is configured as a cartridge or insert for use in a dispensing container or package. In this manner, the cartridge containing product, after its contents have been consumed, can be replaced with another cartridge or insert within the same dispensing container or package to allow recharging or reuse of the original dispenser. In this manner, it is desirable that the cartridge is somewhat disposable and the remaining portions of the dispenser are more permanent for reuse to significantly reduce the waste of plastic material and the cost of using the same or similar products repeatedly. In some specialized packaging or containers or dispensers according to the present invention, the cartridge or insert in the dispenser are mixed together with other products contained within the cartridge or insert, and/or added to the dispenser itself. For example, the cartridge or insert can contain a concentrated beverage liquid or powder that can be mixed with water within the dispenser for making a diluted ready-to-use product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The multiple chamber dispenser according to the present invention has many advantages of providing the same product, slightly different product and/or different products within the chambers or compartments thereof. For example, the compartments can all contain the same color and same flavored product. Another example utilizes the same product (e.g. liquid or powder beverage concentrate) having different colors and different flavors in the various compartments or chambers of the dispenser. As a further example, a beverage concentrated liquid or powder having a particular flavor can be stored in one chamber, a candy such as M&amp;M Minis can be stored in another chamber, pretzel sticks can be stored in a further chamber and nuts and/or raisins can be stored in an additional chamber within the same dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, M&amp;M Minis are packaged in the dispenser so that one color is in one compartment and another color is in another compartment and so forth. Another example utilizes Runts having yellow bananas in one storage compartment, orange colored oranges stored in another compartment, green colored limes stored in a further compartment and so forth. As a further example, one colored Nerds is stored in one compartment, another colored Nerds is stored in an another compartment and so forth. As an even further embodiment, one color and flavored Pop Rocks is stored in one compartment, another color and flavored Pop Rocks is stored in another compartment and so forth. In other embodiments, M&amp;Ms are stored in one compartment, Runts are stored in another compartment and Nerds are stored in a further compartment and so forth. Thus, the dispensers according to the present invention allow for the selective dispensing of different flavors, different colors, different candy products, and possibly a candy product in combination with one or more toys to be dispensed from the container thereof. The multiple chamber component can be made of clear plastic or natural (e.g. natural polyethylene or natural polypropylene) and configured to allow a user to see the various colored and/or types of products stored therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In regards to beverage products, the multiple chamber container or dispenser according to the present invention can be utilized to store and dispense ready-to-use products and/or concentrated products. For example, the multiple chamber container can utilize the same color and same flavor product and/or can contain various colored and flavored products (e.g. variety pack). The container can also contain beverage product in one compartment and food product (e.g. pretzel sticks) in another compartment, a candy product (e.g. M&amp;M Minis) in a further compartment and so forth. Thus, the dispenser according to the present invention can selectively store and dispense numerous same products, similar products and/or different products.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Definitions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> The spray bottle dispenser according to the present invention includes one or more reservoirs containing chemical or chemicals (i.e., chemical reservoirs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The chemical reservoir can be a separate unit indirectly associated with the spray bottle dispenser by packaging, or directly associated to the spray bottle dispenser by connection to the spray bottle dispenser externally or internally. Preferred embodiments contain the one or more chemical reservoirs internally, most preferably contained inside the bottle portion to fully contain an inadvertent chemical spill or release from the one or more chemical reservoirs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In the case of an external connection with the spray bottle dispenser, the chemical reservoir can be connected by a separate piece mechanical fastener such as a plastic tab or strip connector connecting the chemical reservoir to the bottle portion, spray head portion, or connected to both the bottle portions and spray head portions of the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the chemical reservoir can be formed as an integral portion of the bottle portion, spray head portion, and/or downtube. In the integral embodiments, the chemical reservoir can be connected by adhesive, plastic welding, plastic forming (e.g., molding), or by other means to directly integrate the reservoir into the spray bottle dispenser components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the spray bottle dispenser is provided with one or more separate chemical reservoirs to allow the spray bottle dispenser to be recharged one or mor time. In a most preferred embodiments, the spray bottle dispenser is provided with one or more chemical reservoirs to allow the user to access more than one chemical reservoirs during a single recharge to increase (e.g., double, triple, quadruple, etc.) the chemical concentration of the recharging mixture in the particular recharging operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The chemical reservoirs can be identical units to simplify and reduce costs of manufacturing, or alternatively, can be different size, shape and/or configuration of chemical reservoirs. For example, both internally and externally connected chemical reservoirs can be applied, and/or integral and separate type chemical reservoirs can be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The one or more chemical reservoirs of the spray bottle dispenser contain chemical or chemicals. Specifically, the reservoir can be filled or partially filled with only a single chemical compound, a one phase mixture of chemicals, a two phase mixture of chemicals, a dispersion, or any other liquid type chemical(s). Alternatively, the chemical(s) can be in the form of a solid such as a tablet, powder, or granules, or semisolid such as a thick slurry. In any event, the reservoir should contain a chemical reagent that is readily diluted or dissolvable with a solvent, particularly plain water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of a spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The spray bottle comprises a spray head portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including an inner threaded coupler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> threaded onto an outer threaded neck of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A downtube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to the spray head <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> portion, and extends down into the bottom of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fitted with an insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having three separate chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of the insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the insert is provided with a rim <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on an upper portion of the insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The rim <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a diameter grater than the inner diameter of the threaded neck <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the bottle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Thus, the rim <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> functions to suspend the insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within the bottle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are used for storing a predetermined quantity of liquid concentrate in each chamber. The chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sealed at the top by an upper sealing membrane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the bottom of the chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sealed by lower sealing membrane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is open (i.e., not covered by sealing membranes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) to accommodate the downtube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and also allow solvent such as water to be added through the insert into the bottle portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably made of suitable plastic material, and the upper sealing membrane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lower sealing membrane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are preferably made of suitable plastic film, metal foil, or other suitable single or composite layer. The membranes should be chemically resistant to the contents and suitable for making a liquid tight seal with the insert. The upper sealing membrane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lower sealing membrane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be attached to the insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by various means. For example, the membranes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be attached by bonding, adhesive bonding, thermal welding, sonic welding, or by any suitable conventional means for providing a liquid tight seal (e.g., hermetic seal) of the chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Various other inserts having suitable configurations can be substituted for the insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, a five (5) chamber insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; having an open center chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and four (4) chemical chambers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, and four (4) chamber insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; having chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Further, the length of the insert relative to the length of the bottle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be substantially varied based on different concentration levels of the concentrate utilized in the insert. Specifically, higher concentration concentrate requires less volume in the chambers of the insert, and thus reducing the needed length of the insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be made by a variety of different techniques, however, injection molding or extruding techniques are the most suitable methods of manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be marketed inside the bottle at the point-of-sale, and/or can be marketed as a separate unit that can be inserted into a conventional spray bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> In the case of the insert being marketed inside the bottle, all three (3) chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can initially be chemical reservoirs. The bottle is filled with water or other suitable diluting liquid and the top sealing membrane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and bottom sealing membrane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sealing the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be punctured by the tip of the downtube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> during insertion of the downtube into the bottle portion prior to securely fastening the spray head to the bottle portion to complete the packaging assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be open (i.e., devoid of any liquid concentrate, as discussed above) and the bottle is initially filled with proper concentration diluted chemical reagent liquid ready to be marketed with the downtube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> passed through the open chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during assembly. In the embodiment having three (3) chambers as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, two additional doses of concentrate contained in chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be sequentially punctured by the consumer to dose a bottle with concentrate. The bottle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be supplied with water through empty chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> before or after the dosing step by the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of a spray bottle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.

The strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is attached to an inside surface of one wall of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The specific location of the strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be changed from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to other locations on the side and/or bottoms of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Each chemical reservoir <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made in a manner so that is can be ruptured either by forcing the tip of the downtube <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> into the surface of the reservoir <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or by pinching the outside walls of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> together to burst one or more chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For example, the chemical reservoir <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be made so that its wall has one or more lines of weakness <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably made in an infinite length, and then cut to length for the particular application. Thus, different size bottles could potentially have more or less number of individual chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Further, making the strip <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in an infinite manner would allow for high speed production of the strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for high speed insertion during bottling. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> connecting a sealing layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to the back of the strip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Another adhesive layer connects the strip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the wall of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of a spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a spray head portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a bottle portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>.

A downtube <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is connected to the spray head portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and extends down to the bottom portion of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In this third embodiment, a plurality of chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are provided at the bottom of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be individual chemical reservoirs, or alternatively, can be connected together by mechanical coupler in some manner. In any event, the chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must be configured in such a manner so that they can be passed through the open mouth of the bottle portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> A detailed cross-sectional view of one of the chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The chemical reservoir <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be cylindrical or some other suitable shape with an open end <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at a top portion thereof. The open end <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is sealed with a metal foil <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that can be punctured by an instrument, in particular the tip of the downtube <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The reservoir <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is at least partially filled with a chemical concentrate liquid L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In use, the spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is filled by the bottler with diluted chemical reagent. The four (4) chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are each at least partially filled with a chemical concentrate. Thus, this particular configuration allows for four (4) recharging operations. Each recharging operation begins with unscrewing the threaded coupler of the spray head portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> from the spray bottle <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and slightly lifting the spray head portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> upwardly until the tip of the downtube <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> clears the upper surfaces of the reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The user then forces the tip of the downtube <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> through the metal foil <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of one of the reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> causing it to be punctured. The bottle portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is filled with water either before or after the step of accessing one of the chemical reservoirs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of a spray bottle dispenser <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

The middle reservoir <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> has dimensions between those of the upper reservoir <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and lower reservoir <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. This stepped and stacked arrangement allows access by an instrument to puncture sealing membranes (not shown) sealing each reservoir <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> while the insert remains in the bottle portion of the spray bottle dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> A seventh embodiment of a spray bottle dispenser having an insert <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>. The insert <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> having a lip portion <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, a connector portion <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> connecting the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to upper reservoir <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, a connector portion <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> connecting the upper reservoir <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to middle reservoir <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, and a connector portion <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> connecting the middle reservoir <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> to lower reservoir <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. The top and bottom of each reservoir <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are open, and each sealed by upper metal foil <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and a lower metal foil <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In use, the spray bottle dispensers are filled with diluted chemical reagent initially by the bottler, and the downtube is passed only through the cylinder portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. After consumption of the initial diluted chemical reagent, the user withdraws the downtube above the level of the upper reservoir <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, and forces the tip of the downtube through the upper metal foil <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and lower metal foil <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> of the reservoir <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> releasing the chemical concentrate liquid into the bottle portion. A solvent such as water is added before or after the step of accessing the chemical concentrate liquid. After puncturing the metal foil <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, the downtube is lifted upwardly and then passed between the cylinder portion <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and the side of the reservoir <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the downtube can be threaded through the reservoir <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and down along the side of the middle reservoir <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> so as not to puncture the chemical reservoir <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. The connector portion <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> are substantially flexible enough to act as hinges to move the lower reservoirs out of the way so as not to be punctured by the downtube during the insertion operation of the downtube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, only the upper portion of each reservoir is provided with a membrane that can be punctured with the bottoms being molded portions of the reservoirs, and not readily subject to being punctured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In an eighth embodiment, a mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is connected to an insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is identical to the insert shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, with no lip portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The mechanical coupler includes a lip portion <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and a connector portion <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> connected together by four (4) standoffs <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> (only two are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The connector portion <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper portion of the insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, by interference fit, adhesive, sonic welding, thermal welding, or by other suitable connection means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> This arrangement provides four (4) portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to allow water poured through the center of the mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> to pass through and out the ports <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> into the bottle portion when recharging the spray bottle dispenser with this arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> This arrangement allows the insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to be extruded continuously, since no lip need be molded in the insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is provided with upper and lower sealing membranes (not shown) and then attached to the mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> during assembly. Thus, the insert <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> can be cut from a continuous length of material extruded at high speed, filled with chemical concentrate, sealed with the sealing membranes at both ends, and then assembled with the mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> to finish complete assembly. </paragraph>

In a further embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 40</cross-reference>, the tip <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is fluted or grooved around its entire periphery to provide multiple fluid passageways for chemical concentrate to drain from a ruptured reservoir of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> The venting arrangement of a conventional spray head and spray bottle should be maintained with use of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Specifically, a conventional spray head vents air back into the spray bottle to compensate for liquid being withdrawn from the spray bottle during use. Otherwise, as the spray bottle is evacuated, a vacuum condition will be created therein making suction of the liquid through the downtube more difficult or impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> The conventional spray head is provided with an air passageway to vent air in an upper neck portion of the spray bottle. The insert according to the present invention could potentially interfere with venting when used with a conventional spray head and conventional spray bottle, since the insert is essentially a plug in the upper neck portion of the spray bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> and washer <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> can all be designed to facilitate venting, however, it has been found during experimental use that even small micro cracks through or between these components is satisfactory for venting the spray bottle without purposely designing venting features in these components. For example, the through hole <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> in the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, can be slightly oversized relative to the outer diameter of the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> providing a liquid and/or air passageway. The washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> can have various designs, for example, like those shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, the through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has an inner diameter slightly less than the outer diameter of the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to provide a slight interference fit between the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Thus, little if any venting can occur between the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> and the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. However, even with this embodiment, it has been found that sufficient venting occurs through micro cracks in use. In an improved embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>&Prime; again is provided with a through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&Prime; having an inner diameter slightly less than the outer diameter of the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> providing a slight interference fit therebetween. However, a partial circular groove or slot <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&Prime; is provided substantially at the same radius as the location of the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Thus, after the initial reservoir has been ruptured and the bayonet device has been rotated 90&deg;, 180&deg; or 270&deg;, the partial circular groove <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&Prime; is aligned with and overlaps the puncture holes in the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> previously made by the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>. Since the previous reservoirs are also punctured at the bottom wall portion of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, a completed liquid and/or gas passageway is provided through that particular reservoir of the insert. In a further alternative embodiment, the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is provided with a square through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The width of the square through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is slightly less than the outer diameter of the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to provide a slight interference fit therebetween. The corners of the square through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime; serve as four (4) vents between the upper and lower surfaces of the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. Thus, a clear passageway for liquid and/or gas is established through the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> along the sides of the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. The washer <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, can also be provided with the same or similar design to the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> to also facilitate venting of gas and/or liquid from the spray head into the spray bottle. Various other designs and configurations of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> and washer <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> can be designed and adapted for various applications. Due to the many variables affecting venting, all designs should be tested to ensure that adequate venting occurs between the spray head and spray bottle. Again, only very small micro cracks between components or through components are necessary to provide sufficient venting. Further, in the application of a two-neck bottle, additional venting can occur between the cap <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and second neck portion <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> in the spray bottle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> can be provided with additional modifications and designs for use in various applications and with various conventional and non-conventional spray head and spray bottle components. The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&Prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is provided with an additional through hole <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for accommodating and storing the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> when the spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is assembled. Otherwise, the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> can be stored in one of the reservoirs <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. In a further alternate embodiment, insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</cross-reference> is provided with an upper wider through passageway portion <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime; and a lower through passageway portion <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The wider upper through passageway portion <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;&Prime; has been widened significantly over the outer diameter of the dip tube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> to accommodate various spray head designs which have portions extending down from the spray head into the first neck portion of the spray bottle. For example, a CALMAR spray head is provided with a tubular receiver extending down from the spray head for receiving an upper portion of the downtube. The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; can be further modified to properly cooperate and mechanically interface with the structure of various other conventional and non-conventional spray heads. These are examples of such modifications that need to be made to provide for proper assembly and operation of the completed spray dispensing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> show an additional embodiment of an insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime; according to the present invention. In this embodiment, one quadrant of the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; is purposely made void to provide an additional through hole for accommodating the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime; can be molded in this specific configuration. Further, the additional through hole provides substantial venting for gas and/or liquids, and could be potentially utilized for adding water through the insert itself in the application of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime; in a conventional one-neck spray bottle to allow filling with both concentrate and water (i.e., eliminates need for two-neck spray bottle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> can accommodate the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> in one of the four (4) reservoirs <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. However, the tip <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be forced through the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in this embodiment. This particular reservoir can be filled with chemical concentrate causing the reservoir Ito rupture and release chemical concentrate into the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> during assembly, or can be a dummy chamber (i.e., not filled with chemical concentrate) in some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> The insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can be manufactured, marketed and sold as a separate product unit as opposed to an entire spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. In the spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is essentially double packaged. Specifically, in the assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, once the spray bottle apparatus is assembled, the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> which is a package, is packaged inside the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> itself. Thus, any inadvertent leakage by the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> will tend to leak into the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> preventing any inadvertent spillage exterior to the spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> When the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is manufactured, marketed and sold as a separate stand alone unit, any leakage from the insert will be exterior to the insert. For instance, the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> in some embodiments (e.g., metal foil) is somewhat susceptible to easy puncture or damage which could cause inadvertent spillage or contamination. Further, any leakage from the insert of the chemical concentrate could cause damage to packaging or damage to other commercial or other household products and/or facilities storing such an insert. Most important, any spillage could be a personal hazard, in particular to children, who could inadvertently come into contact with or even ingest chemical concentrate causing serious injury or potentially death. Thus, it is preferred to provide an additional sealing or protecting means to an upper portion of the insert or encompassing the entire insert, particularly for consumer use. For example, the insert can be blister packed or packaged in a manner so that the insert is fully encompassed by sealed packaging. Alternatively, only the upper portion of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is further protected. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>, the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> can be connected the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> by driving the bayonet <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> through a dummy chamber and through the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Due to the bayonet tip <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>penetrating through and rupturing the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> is now removably connected to the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> (i.e., tip <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is held by bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Thus, the washer portion <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> protects the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> located between the bottom surface of the washer portion <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> can be connected to the upper portion of the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> by adhesive, thermal welding, inductive welding, ultrasonic welding or other suitable method to more securely releasably connect the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> to the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to require a user to pry the bayonet device <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> from the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> when assembling the spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 and 54</cross-reference>, the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is provided with an additional sealing device (e.g., child safety cap) to further protect the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> against any damage and leakage. In the event the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> should fail, the safety cap <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> biases the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> against the upper sealing surfaces of the insert to maintain an adequate seal. The safety cap <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> can be made of various resilient plastic materials including polyurethane, nylon, polyvinyl chloride and other suitable materials. The safety cap <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> is provided with an inner peripheral groove <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>, which accommodates the edges of the upper flange <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Due to the resilience of the safety cap <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>, the safety cap can be snap fit over the edges of the flange to provide an additional sealing means. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Reactive Chemistry </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to a spray dispensing apparatus having an insert and the insert itself. The insert is provided with at least one reservoir for containing chemical concentrate. In a preferred embodiment, the insert is provided with multiple reservoirs for containing separate charges of chemical concentrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment having multiple separate reservoirs, the insert according to the present invention can be provided with chemical concentrate of the same concentration or chemical concentrate of different concentrations. Further, different chemical compositions can be contained in the separate reservoirs for providing various chemical mixtures. In a preferred embodiment, two or more different reactive chemicals are stored in separate reservoirs that can be both ruptured to allow mixing of these chemicals with or without water initially to form a reactive chemical mixture. Storage of chemicals in this manner ensures freshly reacted chemicals having the highest level of activities. Performance chemicals ranging from applications for personal care, surface cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and other known classes of chemical compounds that can be formed by mixing two or more different charges of chemicals together can be dispensed with the spray dispensing apparatus and insert according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Other configurations of the spraybottle dispenser are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55 and 56</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>, an additional insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> is provided in the second neck portion <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. This arrangement would provide an extra four (4) charges of chemical concentrate for storage in the second neck portion of the spray bottle <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>, the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> is stored as a separate unit in the second neck portion <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. A user unscrews the cap <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> to retrieve the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, disassembles the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> and washer <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> from the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, and then assembles the bayonet <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, washer <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> onto the downtube <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> prior to installing the subassembly into the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> can be stored inside the spray bottle dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&Prime; without comprising or rupturing one of the four (4) reservoirs containing chemical concentrate allowing for four fills or refills of chemical concentrate. In this manner, the spray bottle dispensing apparatus can be shipped empty (i.e., no liquid in the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> but only chemical concentrate inside the insert <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>). Thus, the spray dispensing apparatus <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be shipped to a distributing center or point-of-sale at a greatly reduced weight, since the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> is not provided with liquid contents. Alternatively, the spray bottle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> can be also supplied with liquid contents providing an initial fill of working chemical and four (4) refills, however, there will be no weight savings compared with a conventional spray bottle device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Alternative Cap Type Embodiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> A cap device <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> can be used with a one-neck spray bottle or multiple-neck spray bottle to provide at least one dose or charge of chemical concentrate into the spray bottle. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, a multiple reservoir cap <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> can be provided to add two or more chemicals, preferably reactive chemicals to dose a spray bottle. The cap <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes an upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> nested within a lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is shown provided with two separate reservoirs <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for containing separate charges of chemical concentrate, again preferably reactive chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> The bottom end of the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is provided with a sealing membrane <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> to seal the lower ends of the reservoirs <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is provided with a frangible bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided with a peripheral groove <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to provide a breakable wall portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> The bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with protrusions <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, preferably sharpened, which will puncture and rupture the sealing membrane <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> when the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is further driven downwardly into the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Upon further driving the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> downwardly into the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the lower edge of the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> will cause the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to break away and release the chemicals into a spray bottle to which the cap <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is applied. A center rib <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> separates the one reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the other reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> The cap <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is inserted into a neck portion of a spray bottle. Specifically, the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is received in the neck portion with the upper flange <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>resting on the upper ledge of the neck portion of the spray bottle. The inner threads <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> engage with the external threads of the neck portion of the spray bottle to force the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> downwardly into the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The sealing membrane <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> is forced into the protrusions <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>causing the two reservoirs <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to rupture releasing chemical. As the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is further rotated, the lower edge of the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is rammed into the frangible bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> causing it to break and release chemical into the spray bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a cap device <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided with a shorter height protrusion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; and a higher height protrusion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; and a hole <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>&prime;. The differential height of the protrusions <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; allow for the reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; to be selectively comprised without immediately comprising reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. Any chemical released from either reservoir enters the chamber between the upper cap portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and lower cap portion <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and drains through the through hole <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>&prime;. Thus, the cap <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>&prime; can be partially rotated to rupture reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; to charge the spray bottle, and then at a later time the cap can be reused and further rotated to then comprise the other reservoir <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;.

<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61, a</cross-reference> combined cap and bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown. The device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> connected to a cap <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>&prime; by a protrusion <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;. For example, the protrusion <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; can be configured to snap fit through hole <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> of the bayonet device <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the bayonet device <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> can freely rotate around the protrusion <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; relative to the cap <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>&prime;. In addition, a washer or seal can be provided on the lower side of the washer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> to enhance sealing between the cap and bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> An alternative to the bayonet device <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>, as a &ldquo;reverse-bayonet&rdquo; configuration. Specifically, the reverse-bayonet configuration utilized a cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> including a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. The cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is defined by an upper flange portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and a lower wall portion <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a through hole <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is configured (e.g. pointed, beveled, sharpened) to penetrate through a bottom of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> when the cartridge is forced downwardly into the cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> releasing substance stored in the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> The bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is designed or configured to compromise the bottom of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> in a manner to puncture at least one reservoir of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, multiple bayonet portions <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> can be provided extending upwardly from bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>at different locations (e.g. at 180 degrees, 90 degrees) to simultaneously puncturing two (2), three (3), four (4) or more reservoirs of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the multiple bayonet portions <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> can have different heights to selectively puncture one reservoir by forcing the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> into the cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to a first extent, and then puncture another reservoir at a time interval later to puncture a second reservoir by forcing the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> further into the cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to a second extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> The method of puncturing the bottom of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> must be sufficient to cause adequate release (e.g. drainage) of the cartridge. In the case of a liquid, the puncture must allow some venting of the puncture reservoir of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. This can be accomplished by providing the bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> with various tip designs (See FIGS. <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>), slightly rotating (e.g. back-and-forth) the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> in the cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to increase the size of the puncture hole, and/or providing a through hole in the bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. In different embodiments of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, puncturing occurs through a foil, film or other type of end seal of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, or through the plastic molded bottom of the cartridge <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. In a further alternative, the bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may be a separate piece (e.g. made of metal to further facilitate cutting or puncturing) rather than the integral molded bayonet portion <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62 and 63</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> The cartridge receiver <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> can be provided in the neck portion of a single neck bottle.
