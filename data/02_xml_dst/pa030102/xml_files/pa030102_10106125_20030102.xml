<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a connector for connecting flexible printed circuit boards, a head actuator provided with the connector, and a disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, a disk drive such as a magnetic disk drive comprises magnetic disks, a spindle motor for supporting and rotating the magnetic disks, a head actuator supporting magnetic heads, a voice coil motor for driving the head actuator, a substrate unit, etc, which are housed in a casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The head actuator includes a bearing portion attached to the casing and a plurality of arms extending from the bearing portion. A magnetic head is mounted on each arm by means of a suspension. The substrate unit includes a main flexible printed circuit board (hereinafter referred to as main FPC), the distal end portion of which extends close to the bearing portion. Each magnetic head is connected to one end of a relay flexible printed circuit board (hereinafter referred to as relay FPC) on each arm, and the other end portion of the relay FPC is connected to the main FPC. Thus, each magnetic head is connected electrically to the substrate unit through the relay and main FPC&apos;s and controlled by means of the substrate unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case where the printed circuit boards are connected electrically to each other in this manner, each printed circuit board is provided with connecting pads, a pre-tinning layer is formed on each connecting pad, and the pads are opposed to one another. In this state, the pre-tinning layer is heated from the base-layer side of one of the printed circuit boards. By doing this, the pre-tinning layer is melted to connect the pads electrically and mechanically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Possibly, the relay and main FPC&apos;s may be connected by contact bonding. In the magnetic disk drive, however, the connected portion between the relay and main FPC&apos;s moves as the head actuator rocks, and is subjected to vibration and shock. Accordingly, soldering is widely used to improve the reliability of connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In conventional assembly processes for a magnetic disk drive, soldering the FPC&apos;s is carried out in a clean room. However, the soldering operation includes a process for melting solder by means of a soldering iron. In this process, outgassing from a flux or the like in the solder may generate, possibly contaminating the atmosphere in the clean room and exerting a bad influence upon other components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, soldering the relay and main FPC&apos;s involves operation for soldering very fine connecting pads, so that the reliability of the soldering is easily influenced by workmanship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, repairing the head actuator requires resoldering after the solder on the connecting portions is removed. Thus, repairs are troublesome and their achievement level easily lowers. In addition, an MR element is used for the magnetic head being in current use so that the magnetic head of this type is very weak against static electricity. Therefore, in assembly for a head actuator and magnetic disk drive provided with the same, it is necessary to take measures against electrostatic breakdown to prevent a large current from flowing into the magnetic head from outside. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been achieved in consideration of these circumstances, and its object is to provide a connector for flexible printed circuit boards, capable of easily securely connecting flexible printed circuit boards, a head actuator provided with the same, and a disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, a connector for flexible printed circuit boards according to an aspect of the invention is a connector for electrically connecting a pair of first flexible printed circuit boards, fixed individually on the respective surfaces of two arms spaced and opposed to each other and each extending from a distal end portion of each arm to a proximal end portion thereof, and a second flexible printed circuit board extending from any other portion than the arms toward the proximal end portions. The connector comprises: a female connector formed of the first flexible printed circuit boards; and a male connector provided at the second flexible printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The female connector includes a pair of connecting portions formed on respective proximal-side end portions of the first flexible printed circuit boards and opposed to each other across a given space, each of the connecting portions having first contacts formed by exposing a part of a conductor pattern of the first flexible printed circuit board, a plurality of short-circuit contacts and a short-circuit piece which contacts with the plurality of short-circuit contacts so as to turn the conductor pattern into a closed loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The male connector includes a projection and a pressing portion which are configured to be fitted between the connecting portions of the female connector, second contacts provided on the projection and connected to a conductor pattern of the second flexible printed circuit board, the second contacts being arranged so as to contact with the first contacts when the projection is fitted between the connecting portions, and the pressing portion being configured to press and detach the short-circuit piece from the short-circuit contacts and release the closed loop when the pressing portions are fitted between the connecting portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the connector for flexible printed circuit boards constructed in this manner, the first flexible printed circuit boards and second flexible printed circuit boards can be connected electrically to each other by only inserting and fitting the projections and pressing portions of the male connector that is attached to the second flexible printed circuit boards into the spaces between the connecting portions of the female connectors. Thus, connecting the first and second flexible printed circuit boards requires no soldering, and therefore, never contaminates the atmosphere in a clean room. Further, no veteran skill is needed, and variation in workmanship can be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the female connectors are constructed by opposing the connecting portions of the first flexible printed circuit boards that are attached to the arms, no dedicated housings for the connectors are needed, so that the construction can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The connecting portion provided on the first flexible printed circuit board of each arm has the short-circuit contacts and short-circuit piece that short-circuits the same, and thus the arm itself comprises a short-circuit mechanism for preventing electrostatic breakdown from occurring thereon. Therefore, even in the state that the arm has not been assembled and remains intact, it is possible to prevent electrostatic breakdown from occurring on electronic components connected to the first flexible printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the male connector is connected to the female connectors, being linked with this connection, the short-circuit carried out by the short-circuit piece is released. Thus the first and second main flexible printed circuit boards can be electrically connected to each other. When the male connector is detached from the female connectors, a closed loop is formed in the first flexible printed circuit boards by means of each short-circuit piece again, thereby firmly preventing electrostatic breakdown from occurring on the electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Consequently, by inserting and extracting the male connector in and from the female connector, a function of preventing electrostatic breakdown can be stopped or resumed easily. Thus, the connection between the first and second flexible printed circuit boards can be facilitated, moreover, repairs such as replacing the electronic components can be carried out easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A head actuator according to another aspect of the invention comprises: a bearing portion; two arms each having a proximal end portion attached to the bearing portion, and a distal end portion supporting a head, extending from the bearing portion, the arms being opposed to each other across a given space; first flexible printed circuit boards fixed individually on the respective arms, connected electrically to the respective heads, and extending from the heads to the proximal end portions of the arms; a second flexible printed circuit board connected to the first flexible printed circuit boards; and a male connector attached to the second flexible printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Each of the first flexible printed circuit boards includes a connecting portion provided at the proximal end portion of the arm and having first contacts formed by exposing a part of a conductor pattern, a plurality of short-circuit contacts, and a short-circuit piece which contacts with the plurality of short-circuit contacts so as to turn the conductor pattern into a closed loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The respective connecting portions on the two arms are opposed to each other across a given space to constitute a female connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The male connector includes a projection and a pressing portions which are configured to be fitted between the connecting portions of the female connector, and second contacts provided on the projection and connected to a conductor pattern of the second flexible printed circuit board, the second contacts being arranged so as to contact with the first contacts when the projection is fitted between the connecting portions, and the pressing portions being arranged so as to press and detach the short-circuit piece from the short-circuit contacts, and release the closed loop when the pressing portions are fitted between the connecting portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A disk drive according to still another aspect of the invention comprises a disk; a head configured to write in and retrieving information from the disk; a head actuator supporting the head for movement with respect to the disk; a substrate unit configured to input and output signals with respect to the head; a main flexible printed circuit board extending from the substrate unit and connected to the head actuator; and a male connector attached to the main flexible printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The head actuator includes a bearing portion; two arms each having a proximal end portion attached to the bearing portion, and a distal end portion supporting the head, extending from the bearing portion, the arms being opposed to each other across a given space; and relay flexible printed circuit boards fixed individually on the respective arms, connected electrically to the respective heads, and extending from the heads to the proximal end portions of the arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each of the relay flexible printed circuit boards includes a connecting portion provided at the proximal end portion of the arm and having first contacts formed by exposing a part of a conductor pattern, a plurality of short-circuit contacts and a short-circuit piece which contacts with the plurality of short-circuit contacts so as to turn the conductor pattern into a closed loop, the connecting portions being opposed to each other across a given space to constitute a female connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The male connector includes a projection and a pressing portions which are configured to be fitted detachably in and from the female connector, and second contacts exposed on the projection and connected to a conductor pattern of the main flexible printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The first contacts of the female connectors and the second contacts of the male connector are pressed to each other by fitting the projection and pressing portion of the male connector into the connecting portions of the female connectors, so that the relay flexible printed circuit board and the main flexible printed circuit board are electrically connected to each other, and the short-circuit piece is pressed by means of the pressing portion to come apart from the short-circuit contacts, thereby releasing the closed loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, each magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected electrically to a main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (mentioned later) through a relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which serves as a first flexible printed circuit board, is fixedly stuck on the respective surfaces of each arm and each suspension <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and extends from the distal end of the suspension to the proximal end of the arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in the form of an elongate belt as a whole, the distal end of which is connected electrically to the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the proximal end portion of which constitutes a connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a base layer of an insulating material such as polyimide, a conductor pattern of a copper foil on the base layer, and a solder resist layer formed over the whole conductor pattern on the base layer except pad portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The electrodes of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are soldered to the pad portions (not shown) on the distal end portion of the relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Further, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that are formed by exposing parts of the conductor pattern, and is located adjacent to a side edge of the arm at the proximal end portion of the arm. Each connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes four elongate first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the arm or to the side edge of the arm, and are arranged at given spaces in the longitudinal direction of the arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Each connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes a pair of short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> located parallel to the first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are connected respectively to two of the first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Further, a short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> made of metal and having a spring property is fixed on the connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. A tip portion of the short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is resiliently pressed against the pair of short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, thereby electrically conducting, i.e., short-circuiting the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the conductor pattern of the relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending from the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> becomes a closed loop. As a result, a head arm alone can prevent excessive current from flowing into the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing electrostatic breakdown in the magnetic head from occurring. In the manner described above, the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> constitute a short-circuit mechanism for preventing the electrostatic breakdown in the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from occurring. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, the second contacts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of each projection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are pressed by means of the first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of each female connector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to make electrical conduction. After that, each pressing claw <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of each pressing projection <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> formed on the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is thrust between their corresponding short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Thus each short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is pressed by the pressing claw <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and strained resiliently, thereby leaving from the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As a result, the short-circuit of the paired short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in each connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is released so that the closed loop between the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is released, that is, the circuit is opened. At this time, the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has been connected to the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so that the closed loop is provided in the different manner. Therefore, electrostatic breakdown does not occur thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> After the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a screw <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is driven into the tapped hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>a in the one abutting portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the spacer ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>b through the through hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the male connector, whereby the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is screwed to the bearing assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, connecting the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Note that, when the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is disconnected from the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to maintain or repair the HDD, each pressing projection <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is disengaged firstly from the short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the female connector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Thus, the short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the pair of short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> again by its own elasticity, thereby turning the circuit of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into a closed loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After forming the closed loop in the manner described above and preventing electrostatic breakdown from occurring on the magnetic head, the second contacts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of each projection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are disengaged from the first contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of the female connector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the connection between the first and second contacts is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> According to the HDD constructed in this manner, the relay FPC <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be connected electrically to each other by only inserting and fitting the projections <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is attached to the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the spaces between the connecting portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that are attached to the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, connecting these FPC&apos;s requires no soldering, and therefore, never contaminates the atmosphere in a clean room. Further, no veteran skill is needed, and variation in workmanship can be lowered. In consequence, the assembly time can be shortened to improve the manufacturing efficiency and lower the manufacturing cost, and the reliability of connection can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Since the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are constructed by opposing the connecting portions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the relay FPC&apos;s <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that are attached individually to the arms, moreover, they can be automatically formed by attaching the arms to the bearing assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Since the abutting portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the spacer rings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can double as the respective housings of the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, furthermore, no dedicated housings for the connectors are needed, so that the construction can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The first and second contacts <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be accurately connected to one another by positioning the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with respect to the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by means of the abutting portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the spacer rings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, the pitches of the contacts can be narrowed, so that the connectors can be miniaturized. Further, screwing can improve the reliability of prevention of disengagement that is attributable to vibration, shock, and rotation of the head actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The connecting portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of each arm of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which short-circuits the short-circuit contacts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and thus the arm itself comprises a short-circuit mechanism for preventing electrostatic breakdown from occurring thereon. Therefore, even in the state that the arm has not been assembled and remains intact, it is possible to prevent electrostatic breakdown from occurring on the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, being linked with this connection, the short-circuit carried out by the short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is released. Thus the magnetic head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and main FPC can be connected electrically to each other. When the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is detached from the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a closed loop is formed again in the circuit of each magnetic head by means of each short-circuit piece <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, thereby firmly preventing electrostatic breakdown from occurring on the magnetic head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Consequently, by fitting and extracting the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in and from female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a function of preventing electrostatic breakdown can be stopped or resumed easily. Thus, the connection between the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be facilitated, moreover, repairs such as replacing the magnetic head in the head actuator etc. can be carried out easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are provided on the respective proximal end portions of the arms for rocking motion, and the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to the female connectors. Therefore, the center of gravity of the connectors can be situated close to the center of rotation of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the moment of inertia can be lowered, and the accessing speed can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment described above, the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided with the fourth contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the connection between the voice coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Therefore, male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be hybridized, and the relay FPC&apos;s <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be connected to the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by means of only one connector. Thus, the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be connected to the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> entirely by connector-connection, so that the connecting operation can be made easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of a head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of an HDD according to a second embodiment of the invention and its structure for connection. Like reference numerals are used to designate like portions of the first and second embodiments, and a detailed description of those portions is omitted. Thus, only differences between the two embodiments will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, a support frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a flexible printed circuit board for connection (hereinafter referred to as connecting FPC) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is connected electrically to a voice coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The connecting FPC <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends close to female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A connecting portion having a third contact <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed by exposing pad portions of a conductor pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a pair of engaging projections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that protrude perpendicularly from a base <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and are opposed to each other across a given space. A fourth contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is fixed to the inner surface of each engaging projection <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Each fourth contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> penetrates the base <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and projects from the main FPC. It is soldered to its corresponding pad portion of the main FPC. Thus, the two fourth contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are connected electrically to the conductor pattern of the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> constructed in this manner is connected to the female connectors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the head actuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a side edge portion of the support frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the support frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on which the third contact <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is provided is fitted in a fitting recess that is defined between the engaging projections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Thus, the fourth contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the respective inner surfaces of the projections <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are pressed against the third contact <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the support frame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to make electrical conduction, whereupon the voice coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the main FPC <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are connected electrically to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment arranged in this manner can enjoy the same functions and effects of the foregoing embodiment. If the male connector <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is hybridized according to the second embodiment, moreover, it is necessary only that the contacts are redirected, so that the cost of the connectors can be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> According to the foregoing embodiments, for example, the arms are four in number. However, the number of the arms according to the invention is expected only be an even number, and may be two or six or more. </paragraph>
