<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a motorized electric toothbrush with a multi-position switch allowing for an automatic mode of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Use of motorized electric toothbrushes used as an aid in cleansing teeth is well known. Typically these toothbrushes employ rotating, reciprocating, or oscillating motion, or a combination thereof, to effectuate the cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A feature commonly found on these toothbrushes is an on/off switch located on or near the handle portion of the toothbrush. The primary feature of such a switch is that it remains either in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position or the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position until the user manually changes it. With such a switch, the user has a limited number of choices. The toothbrush motor can be engaged prior to the brush head being placed in the mouth, or the user can wait until the brush head is placed within the mouth before engaging the motor. Both of these choices have inherent undesirable consequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the user engages the motor prior to placing the brush head in the mouth, the rapid movement of brush head may cause the toothpaste to be shaken off the bristles. Conversely, if the user waits until the brush head is inside the mouth, and in particular in contact with the teeth, it may be difficult to engage the switch, depending on its position relative to the user&apos;s hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another feature commonly found in motorized electric toothbrushes is a removable brush head section. This allows the brush head section to be replaced when the bristles become worn, and also allows the same toothbrush to be shared by multiple users. Typically, a removable brush head section attaches to the toothbrush handle and contains linkages to transfer mechanical power from the motor to a bristle section. Different types of attachments and linkages are known in the art, with particular mechanisms chosen to achieve particular results. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,359 issued to Fritsch et al. on Oct. 30, 2001 describes a motorized electric toothbrush having a removable brush section with an attachment mechanism intended to reduce noise and vibrations. Another example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,030 issued to Hazeu et al. on Nov. 17, 1998. Hazeu et al. describes a motorized electric toothbrush having a removable brush attachment with linkages designed to induce specific bristle motions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The patents referenced above are just two examples of the various types of removable brush head toothbrushes. Despite their varied and widespread use, each of the known designs contains the same limitation: once the motor is turned on, it operates continuously until it is turned off. None of these designs include an automatic mode of operation that provides for motorized operation only when the toothbrush is being used by an operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved motorized electric toothbrush that overcomes the above referenced shortcomings of prior art toothbrushes, by including on the toothbrush a removable head portion and further providing for an automatic mode of operation that allows the motor to operate only when the toothbrush is being used by an operator. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention provides a motorized electric toothbrush that is operable in an automatic mode, such that the motor only engages when the brush head is in contact with the operator&apos;s teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention provides a motorized electric toothbrush that is operable in an automatic mode and has a removable head portion to facilitate replacement when the bristles are worn, and to allow use of the toothbrush by multiple users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a motorized electric toothbrush is provided that comprises a handle portion that has a first housing, and a removable head portion that has a bristle head and a second housing and is selectively attachable to the handle portion. A switch has a first position for preventing motorized operation of the toothbrush and a second position for facilitating motorized operation of the toothbrush. Exerting pressure on the bristle head places the switch in the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention provides a motorized electric toothbrush that comprises a handle portion that has a first housing, and a removable head portion that has a bristle head and a second housing and is selectively attachable to the handle portion. A first switch is disposed within the handle portion having a first position for preventing motorized operation of the toothbrush and a second position for facilitating automatic operation of the toothbrush. A second switch is disposed within one of the housings and actuates when the toothbrush is used by an operator. This causes motorized operation of the toothbrush when the first switch is in the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the invention provides a handle portion that has a first housing, and a removable head portion that has a bristle head and a second housing and is selectively attachable to the handle portion. A first switch is disposed within the handle portion and has a first position for preventing motorized operation of the toothbrush. The first switch also has a second position for facilitating automatic operation of the toothbrush, and a third position for continuous motorized operation of the toothbrush. A second switch is disposed within one of the housings and actuates when the toothbrush is used by an operator. This causes motorized operation of the toothbrush when the first switch is in the second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The above object and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified descriptive side view of an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. A first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, located in a handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, has two positions: &ldquo;off&rdquo; and &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. While in the automatic mode, a motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged only when a force (F) is exerted on a removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This occurs when a bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> sufficiently contacts a user&apos;s teeth. As used here and throughout, the term &ldquo;sufficiently contacts&rdquo; implies a contact that is sufficient to cause a slight movement of at least a part of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the direction of the force. The force exerted by a user during normal brushing typically constitutes a sufficient contact. Because of the movement of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is actuated, an electric circuit is completed, and current flows from a battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits power to the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a series of mechanical linkages, shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and partially represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as drive <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a simple wiring schematic <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of a circuit for the toothbrush shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is electrically connected between the battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position, the circuit is open and there is no voltage across the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, control of the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is transferred to the second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While operating in the automatic mode, the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is only engaged when a force (F&prime;) is applied to the second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which occurs as a result of the force (F) being applied to the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be placed in various locations within the toothbrush, such as in the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or under the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be eliminated from the circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, resulting in a circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this configuration, switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; is the only switch in the circuit. When the circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; is used in a toothbrush, the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; can be placed in various locations within the toothbrush, such as in a handle portion or under a bristle head. When the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; is located under the bristle head, the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is engaged when a force is applied to the bristle head. For example, when there is no force applied to the bristle head, the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; is in a first position and the circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; is open. When the force (F&prime;) places the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; in a second position, the circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; is closed and current flows from the battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; to the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. A toothbrush wired with such a circuit is effectively always in the automatic mode. That is, any time a force (F) is applied to the bristle head, the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The two circuits <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>both allow a toothbrush to be used in an automatic mode. That is, the toothbrush motor is engaged whenever a force is applied to that portion of the toothbrush that contains the second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;. This facilitates ease of use, eliminating the need to operate a typical slide-button switch after the bristle head is placed in the operator&apos;s mouth. Another advantage of a such a configuration is that a consumer can engage the toothbrush motor while the toothbrush is still packaged-i.e., prior to sale. In this way, the consumer can evaluate the operation of the toothbrush before purchase. Some prior art toothbrushes have a multi-function switch configured such that the consumer operates the toothbrush in the package using one activation mode, then operates the toothbrush during normal use in another activation mode. Such is not the case with the present invention, which affords the consumer the opportunity to activate the toothbrush in the package exactly as it will be activated during normal use. In today&apos;s consumer savvy environment, this feature provides another advantage over prior art toothbrushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exploded view of the motorized electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Many of the components of the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are covered by a first housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Similarly, many of the components of the removable brush head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are covered by a second housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> is shown partially exploded for clarity. The first and second housings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will usually be made from a polymeric material, and may be opaque, clear, or translucent. When the first and second housings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are clear or translucent, the toothbrush operator may see the movement of some of the toothbrush components when the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged. In addition, aesthetically pleasing features such as flashing lights (not shown) can be added to the components within the housings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to augment the visual appearance. The removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes a shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that on one end has a pinion carrier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and on the other a yoke <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> configured to attach to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A pinion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and interfaces with a rack <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Also included in the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a snap ring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is manufactured in different colors such that removable brush heads belonging to different users can have different colored snap rings for easy identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The components of the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with selected components shown enlarged for clarity in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A rocker element <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> serves a number of important functions. First, it contains clips <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that help secure the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In addition, trunnions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, only one of which is visible, rotate in apertures <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereby allowing the rocker element <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to pivot as force is applied to the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As the rocker element <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> pivots about the trunnions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> moves within a slot <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is located in a first casing portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which also contains one of the apertures <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which one of the trunnions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates. Also located in the first casing portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is the first switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which comprises first and second contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are attached to the first casing portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in such a way that movement of the pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> within the slot <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> selectively causes the contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to contact each other and thereby electrically connect. When the contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> electrically connect, the second switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is actuated. This means that when the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the automatic mode of operation, electrical connection of the contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> engages the motor and causes movement of the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the automatic mode of operation, sufficient contact of the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the user&apos;s teeth will cause a slight deflection of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This in turn causes the rocker element <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to pivot on its trunnions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereby moving the pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> within the slot <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. When the pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> causes electrical connection of the contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged without the user having to manually actuate any additional switches. Hence, motorized operation of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. The contact plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also acts like a spring, so that when the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not in contact with the user&apos;s teeth, the contact plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> pushes against the pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and biases away from the contact plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Thus, the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> disengages when the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is no longer in contact with the user&apos;s teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are wired to a printed circuit (PC) board <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Though the wires are removed from the figures for clarity, the simple wiring involved in the present invention is easily understood by one skilled in the art. The PC board <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> controls the electrical components of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has terminals <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that are also wired to the PC board <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has battery terminals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> that are wired to the PC board <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Thus, the first switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is actuated by an operator who presses a switch cover <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that moves a switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into contact with a component <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the PC board <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Pressing the switch cover <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> toggles the switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position and the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> also includes a drive shaft seal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a seal support <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The drive shaft seal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> helps to ensure that fluid does not reach the electrical components of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is of the rechargeable type, a light emitting diode (LED) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is provided to indicate to the user when the battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is being charged. The LED <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided with a translucent cover <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to allow the user to see the LED <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which would otherwise be covered by the first housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is held in place by a spring assembly <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and an end cap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The end cap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is provided with an O-ring seal <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to further ensure that fluids do not reach the electrical components of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Also included in the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a flat element <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> attached to the first housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to allow the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be laid on a flat surface such that the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remains pointing upward. This helps to keep the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stationary on a surface that is not level, and keeps the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from contacting the surface, which may not be clean. Aesthetic features <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are added to enhance the visual appeal of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The reciprocating movement of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is guided by a bushing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The actual movement of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> resembles a typical slider crank mechanism. The motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a rotating motor shaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that has a spur gear <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attached to it. The spur gear <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> intermeshes with and rotates a ring gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that has integrally attached to it a cam <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The ring gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the cam <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are held in a second casing portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a pin <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The cam <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> rotates within a cam follower <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is attached to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rotational motion of the motor shaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is translated into reciprocating motion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. When the removable head portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the handle portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the yoke <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connects to a head <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> such that the shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> reciprocates along with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This in turn moves the pinion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the rack <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and causes the bristle head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to translate and rotate simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a portion of a toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. As in the first embodiment, the toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a handle portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that has a first housing <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that has a bristle head <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a second housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the drive mechanism within the replaceable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is the same as in the preferred embodiment. This includes a shaft and a pinion which interfaces with a rack to drive the bristle head <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. A yoke <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, connects to a head <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of a drive shaft <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> which reciprocates when a motor (not shown) is engaged. A seal <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is disposed around the drive shaft <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to protect the electrical components of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from contamination by fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes an automatic mode of operation with a first switch (not shown) that is configured as in the previous embodiment. To facilitate automatic operation, the toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a second switch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</cross-reference>, that includes a contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> having legs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and a contact rod <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the contact rod <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are disposed within the handle portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and covered by a pressure sensitive seal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Similar to the contact plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> used in the first embodiment, the contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the contact rod <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are wired to a PC board (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The method by which the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> attaches to the handle portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is also different from the first embodiment. An adaptor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, located inside the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> snaps into recesses <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in the handle portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This attachment allows the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to be securely attached to the handle portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and at the same time allows for a slight pivotal movement of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> when the bristle head <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> sufficiently contacts the user&apos;s teeth. As consistently used throughout the various embodiments, &ldquo;sufficiently contacts&rdquo; merely implies a contact that is sufficient to cause a slight movement of at least a part of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. As the removable head portion <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> undergoes the slight pivoting motion caused by contact with the user&apos;s teeth, a projection <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> pushes into a notch <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in the pressure sensitive seal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. As the projection <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> moves into the notch <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the pressure sensitive seal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> pushes against the contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. With the legs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> held stationary, the contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> deflects in a spring-like fashion until it contacts the contact rod <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. This actuates the second switch <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and allows for motorized operation of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> when it is in the automatic mode. The spring-like deflection of the contact plate <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> also acts to bias it away from the contact rod <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, to disengage the motor when the bristle head is not in contact with the user&apos;s teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Portions of a third embodiment of the present invention are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, a toothbrush <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a handle portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a first housing <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and a removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that has a second housing <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and a bristle head (not shown). As in the previous embodiments, the toothbrush <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a first switch (not shown) having an &ldquo;off&rdquo; position that prevents motorized operation of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position that allows the toothbrush <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to function in an automatic mode. A second switch <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> comprises two stationary contact plates <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and a third contact plate <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> includes a projection <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> that fits into a notch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> in the first housing <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the handle portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> attaches to the handle portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> at snaps <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. This connection allows the removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> be securely attached to the handle portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and at the same time allows for a slight pivotal movement of the removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> when a bristle head (not shown) sufficiently contacts the user&apos;s teeth. As the removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> pivots, the third contact plate <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> contacts, and thereby electrically connects, the stationary contact plates <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. This actuates the second switch <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and causes motorized operation of the toothbrush <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> when it is in the automatic mode. The projection <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> also acts as a spring as the removable head portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> pivots, thereby keeping the third plate <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> biased away from the stationary plates <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> when the bristle head is not in contact with the user&apos;s teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a simple wiring schematic <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of a circuit configuration applicable to any of the embodiments described above. A first switch <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> corresponds to a first switch located within the toothbrush handle. When the first switch <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is in the first position (open), no current flows from the battery <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. When the first switch <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is in the second position, the motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is connected to a circuit <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> so that operation of the motor is dependent on a second switch <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. When a force (F) is applied to actuate (close) the second switch <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, current flows from the battery <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. This illustrates the automatic mode of operation for the toothbrushes described in detail above. The first switch <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> has a third position however, and in that position the motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is connected to a circuit <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> so that current flow to the motor does not depend on the second switch <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Rather, when the first switch is in the third position, the motor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> operates continuously, which is the standard mode of operation for motorized electric toothbrushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While these embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention.
