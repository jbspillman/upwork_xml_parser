<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising the step of epitaxially growing of an n-type doped layer of a semiconductor material using an n-type dopant gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such a method relates to the growth of doped epitaxial Si or Si<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Ge<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>(SiGe) layers on monocrystalline silicon by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Controlling the dopant concentration and dopant profile in such epitaxial layers may be a challenging task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art that during epitaxial growth of Si or SiGe in combination with doping at a low temperature, the incorporation of dopant continues after switching off the dopant supply. This process is generally known as the autodoping effect. Due to this effect in such an epitaxial growth process, the dopant profile obtained will differ from the desired profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, such an autodoping effect occurs due to (high-temperature) diffusion of a dopant from the underlying layer into the grown epitaxial layer, due to desorption of dopant species from the walls and the substrate holder of an epitaxy reactor vessel, and due to evaporation of dopant species from the front and back side of the substrate. Autodoping may thus alter the dopant concentration in the epitaxial layer in a rather unpredictable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, it is also known in the art that at a low growth temperature, segregation of n-type dopants (P, As) occurs at the Si surface, which influences the dopant profile in the epitaxial layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, high-temperature processes (at a temperature between &tilde;800 and &tilde;1200&deg; C.) have been developed in which the autodoping effect is suppressed, while at the same time segregation of the dopant is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> EP 0905288 A1 discloses a high temperature CVD process for growth of epitaxial layers in which the dopant concentration changes abruptly at the interface of the epitaxial layer and the monocrystalline Si substrate. During the final stage of the pre-epi bake, when most or all of the native oxide has been removed, a pressure pulse is generated by a flow of reducing gas which lowers the dopant concentration at the surface. The pressure is increased from &tilde;1.33&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Pa to &tilde;1,013&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>Pa. After a subsequent purge step to reduce the pressure again to &tilde;1.33&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Pa, an epitaxial film is grown in a low-pressure CVD process, in which the autodoping effect is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Methods according to the prior art, as described above, disadvantageously suffer from the fact that growth processes take place at a relatively high temperature. At a high temperature, the diffusion rate of dopants is high, which strongly complicates the formation of an abrupt dopant profile in the epitaxial layer, i.e., a well-defined (e.g. block-shaped) concentration profile of the n-type dopant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a well-known way to prevent autodoping is the removal of excess P (or As) from the surface of a semiconductor wafer and from the inside surfaces of the epitaxy reactor chamber in a desorption step at a reduced pressure and a high temperature. However, such a high-temperature step defeats the purpose to grow steep profiles due to high diffusion rates of the dopants at that temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the methods from the prior art all relate to epitaxial layers having a thickness of at least one micron. The formation of shallow layers with abrupt n-type dopant profiles does not appear feasible if use is made of the methods from the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a process which allows the formation of thin Si or SiGe epitaxial layers with well-defined and abrupt n-type dopant profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is obtained by a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising the step of epitaxially growing of an n-type doped layer of a semiconductor material using an n-type dopant gas, the growth process being performed at a pressure higher than 2.66&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the method according to the present invention enables the autodoping of epitaxial layers to be suppressed by using an n-type dopant. Moreover, the growth of very thin epitaxial layers (less than &tilde;100 nm) with an abrupt n-type dopant profile is feasible using the method according to the present invention. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, the growth method according to the present invention will be explained by means of some experiments which illustrate the growth of n-type doped epitaxial Si or SiGe layers. The dopant profiles resulting from these experiments are measured by SIMS. The analysis of the results will clearly show the improvement obtained by growing such doped epitaxial Si or SiGe layers by means of a method in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The growth of a Si epitaxial layer on a Si substrate by means of CVD is performed by passing a Si-containing gas over a Si wafer in a conditioned environment. Usually, a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>carrier gas containing SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiHCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>as Si precursor is used. The growing layer can be doped in-situ by adding e.g., B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>for p-type layers and AsH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>for n-type layers to the gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> At low temperatures, below 800&deg; C. and preferably around or below 700&deg; C., the diffusion of dopant atoms is negligible and, in theory, extremely steep doping profiles (so-called box profiles) can be grown. Low-temperature epitaxy commonly takes place at reduced pressure (6.6&times;10<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>-6.6&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>Pa) to benefit from the lower partial pressure of contaminants like oxygen and moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When p-type doped Si or SiGe layers (B) are grown, however, the profiles for n-type dopants are vastly inferior to the p-type layers, due to, among other things, the autodoping effect described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a SIMS plot of an As-doped epitaxial layer on a semiconductor surface, produced by means of a growing method from the prior art. The As-doped epitaxial layer was grown in a low-pressure CVD process at 700&deg; C., 2.66&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>Pa with a gas flow of SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and an AsH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas flow. As a carrier gas H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was used. The intention was to grow an undoped epitaxial Si capping layer on top of an As-doped epitaxial layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The SIMS plot shows the profile of arsenic (As) as a function of sputtering depth in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> SIMS plot is shown of an As-doped layer with a doped capping layer. The target profile having a Si capping layer without dopant is indicated by the dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the actual profile neither the leading slope nor the trailing slope is steep. What is even worse is the fact that after the AsH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow has been stopped there still is As delivery, resulting in a high As concentration at the surface. The Si capping layer is shown to be unintentionally doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the high As surface concentration is not an artifact called &ldquo;the SIMS artifact&rdquo;, well-known to persons skilled in the art, but indicates a real accumulation of As at the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The profile in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is representative of what happens when As or P-doped layers are grown at relatively low temperature and low pressure. It is noted that usually P profiles are found to have a slightly better defined shape than As profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The Si precursor that is used makes no significant difference to the resulting dopant concentration profile. A solution to improve the trailing slope basically consists in exposing the surface to the doping gas without a Si precursor. After a while the gas flow of the dopant gas is switched off and the flow of the Si precursor (e.g. SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) is switched on. At this point the growth of the epitaxial layer starts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an SIMS plot of a P-spike in an epitaxial layer grown by exposure of a monocrystalline Si surface to a phosphorus-containing gaseous species using a method from the prior art in which the dopant gas and the Si source gas are applied consecutively rather than simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The SIMS plot shows the profile of phosphorus (P) as a function of sputtering depth in the sample. This dopant profile was grown using SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at 700&deg; C. and a pressure of 2.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>Pa (carrier gas: H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). Using this method, steep slopes can be obtained, as is clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A P spike has been grown at a depth of &tilde;110 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After exposing the surface to a PH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-containing gas ambient (in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), the PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas source was closed and the Si source was opened to grow an epitaxial layer. In the SIMS plot this point is indicated by arrow A. In the SIMS plot, the Si capping layer is found between the surface and a depth below &tilde;110 nm (as indicated by arrow A). It is obvious that this method does not solve the main problem, which is the very slow drop of the high P level in the Si capping layer (&gt;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, excess P (or As) can be removed from the surface of the wafer and from the inside surfaces of the epitaxy reactor chamber in a desorption step at reduced pressure and high temperature. However, the high temperature defeats the purpose of growing steep profiles at temperatures at which diffusion does not play a significant role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a SIMS plot of examples of P-spikes grown by means of the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The SIMS plot shows the profile of phosphorus (P) for each example as a function of sputtering depth in the respective sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, by way of illustration, an example of a P-spike grown from a SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>precursor (indicated by arrow A), and an example of a P-spike grown for a SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>precursor (arrow B) are shown. Each P-doped epitaxial layer was covered with a Si capping layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> These P-spikes were grown using SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, respectively, and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>as the dopant at 700&deg; C. and a pressure of &tilde;1.013&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>Pa (carrier gas: H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). In each example, the Si capping layer was grown from the respective Si precursor gas in a subsequent step, after closing the PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that in both examples the leading slope of the P spike improves considerably when the growth takes place at atmospheric pressure rather than at reduced pressure. The Si capping layer appears to be free of dopant. The SIMS analysis shows that the dopant level is well below the detection limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is noted that a similar result may be obtained at sub-atmospheric pressure substantially above &tilde;1.33&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Pa. A preferred pressure turns out to be within the range of pressures above 2.66&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Pa. A maximum pressure would be below 2.026&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Between the process where SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as Si precursor and the process where SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is used as the precursor, no difference in dopant profile was found other than a different doping level and a different growth rate. The improvement over runs made at reduced pressure is clear (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the P level at the surface side of the P-spike quickly drops to the SIMS detection limit. Using the method of the present invention, there is no sign of P segregation at the surface. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the increase in concentration towards the surface is a SIMS artifact, well known to persons skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In general, it was found that P-doped layers can be properly controlled when the runs are made at atmospheric pressure rather than reduced pressure. Box-shaped structures can be grown with, sufficiently steep slopes, even when no special step in the CVD process is applied like e.g. exposing the surface to PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>without growing a layer. It is found that when AsH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used as a doping gas the improvement is less spectacular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In summary, the low temperature-growth of n-type doped layers can be controlled when PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(or some other P-containing compound) is used as a precursor and when the growth is performed at atmospheric pressure, or rather at a pressure significantly higher than the pressure commonly used in low-temperature epitaxy. </paragraph>
