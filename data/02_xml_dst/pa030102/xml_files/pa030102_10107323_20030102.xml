<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an inspection system and method for pictures. More particularly, the invention relates to an inspection system and method for pornographic pictures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As the network communication and the information techniques are fast updated day by day, Internet, World Wide Web, Information High way, and so on have been developed. When all information of the data files, voice, image in our practical daily life are converted to a digital format, the information then can be transmitted to the whole world through the information network. The information can be shared by the whole world in a fillip of time. Nowadays, more and more people start to rely upon the information network to proceed for the activities of entertainment, research, and business. It has been about 400 million users on information network. The development of network has provided a fast and convenient communication environment and information circulation, and has also created a rich and secret cyberspace. Network users do not necessary to reveal their actual personal status and can freely play in it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently, the network criminal events are increasing, and are concerned by people. Particularly, the pornographic criminal events through the network have been flooding over the society and harm the youths. Since the network users can easily touch the pornographic information from various pornographic web sites, including the erotic word files, pornography pictures, and motion picture. Parents always worry about their sonnies who would touch the pornographic information through the network. Those schools and public libraries, which provide users to enter the network, get the pressure requested from the parents to install software in the computer to inspect and filter the harmfild pornographic contents. Moreover, in a company, the boss of the company also complains about some employees who would download the pornographic pictures from the network or transmitting pornographic pictures through E-mail. Since most portion of the bandwidth of the network is occupied by the transmitting the pornographic pictures, company resource is spend without any profit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The current software sold in the market for filtering the pornographic information needs a large database, which can be installed in the computer that has provides the service to entry the network. The filtering software is, for example, X-stop or SurfWatch used in the network station. When the users entry the network and try to connect a web site which is on the list of the filtering software, the connection would not be successful, such that more thousand and thousand pornographic web sites, file transfer protocol (FTP) centers, and news groups can be filtered. However, if the filtering software is not constantly updated, once the pornographic websites changes their network addresses or new web sites are made, the filtering software still cannot effectively avoid the pornographic invasion. Therefore it is needed for an inspection mechanism to instantly apply on the content of information, and directly inspect and filter out the possible pornographic picture files, so that the youths can efficiently make use of the network resources without negative effect or it can effectively prevent the company employees from occupying the network bandwidth to download the pornographic pictures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional method is limited by the image discerning techniques for directly inspect and filter the doubted picture files, and can be satisfied. Since the performance of the current picture discerning engine is like the ability of a ten years old child, the picture discerning engine can only roughly distinguish whether a picture is pornographic or not. A pornographic picture, which is wrongly judged as a non-pornographic picture can always pass the inspection of the picture discerning engine. On the other hand, if the data of picture is inspected and filtered by performing a comparison with the database, the picture can only be compared with known pictures stored in the database. For those pornographic pictures not stored in the database, are simply judged as non-pornographic pictures. For those new published pornographic pictures are to be wrongly judged as the non-pornographic pictures due to the information is not stored in the database. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram, schematically illustrating the inspection system for pornographic picture, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The inspection system for pornographic picture of the invention takes a pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to perform double filtering, so as to improve the discerning precision for the pornographic picture. The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is used to discern an image signal Ps of the input picture to be inspected and select one of image signal Ps of the input picture to be inspected and a first judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The picture to be inspected is discerned by the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. If the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> judges the picture to be inspected as the pornographic picture, the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> exports the first judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The first judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a judging result for the picture to be inspected as the pornographic picture. If the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> judges the picture to be inspected as a non-pornographic picture or the discerning ability is too low to judge, the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> exports the picture to be inspected to the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for inspection. The database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is used to compare the picture of database with the picture to be inspected, and export a second judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second judging signal includes the result for the picture to be inspected as the pornographic picture. Since the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to a pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can search the pornographic pictures in the database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and perform a comparison of similarity for the pictures in the database and the picture to be inspected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> uses the statistic result as the base for judging. The mathematic statistic algorithm is used to compute the feature data for the picture to be inspected, so as to obtain a feature value. At the same time, the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is set with a pornographic feature discerning value. The sources of the feature data for picture usually includes color, style, position, size, veining distribution, object attribution, and so on. For example, since the pornographic picture usually appears in full or partial nude image, a portion ratio of skin color can be selected as one source of feature data, which is provided to the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for judgment. The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> first defines a probability threshold for the skin color density distribution and computes a quantity of a function of a probability density by a block region of the picture. The quantity of the function of the probability density is compared with probability threshold. If the quantity of the function of the probability density is greater than probability threshold, then the color vector is judged to as belonging to skin color. Otherwise, it is not belonging to skin color. According to this, the quantity of the function of the probability density is compared with the probability threshold one by one for each of the blocks regions. As a result, each image pixels of the picture are divided into two types of skin color and non-skin color. A statistic algorithm is used to judge the portion ratio of skin color for the whole picture to serve as a feature value for this picture. In the mean time, the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, according to a relation of the feature value of the portion ratio of skin color with the set of pornographic feature discerning value, judges whether or not the picture is a pornographic picture. Since the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> directly inspects the picture to be inspected, it is not necessary to worry about that the picture to be inspected is a newly published pornographic picture. This can avoid a failure of judgment due to that the pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not updated and the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> cannot filter the pornographic picture away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to the pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and searches in the pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. By this manner, a similarity comparison is performed between the pictures in the database with the picture to be inspected. The comparing manner used in the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> takes the feature points as the base for check. The sources of feature data of picture includes color, style, position, size, veining distribution, object attribution, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the essential feature points of the pictures, which can serve as a data index. Through the comparison between the picture to be inspected and the pictures in that database, the similar pornographic picture having most features points corresponding to the picture to be inspected is found. The similarity comparison is then performed for judging the pornographic picture. The pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes various pornographic pictures for comparison. The pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is also regularly updated. Particularly, those pornographic pictures, which are easily misjudged as a non-pornographic picture by the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are added to the pornographic picture database so as to compensate the part which is hard to be discerned by the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The pornographic picture is then effectively detected, resulting in the improvement of discerning ability for the pornographic picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an inspection flow diagram, schematically illustrating the inspection method for pornographic picture, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the inspection method for the pornographic picture is taking the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to perform double filtering, so as to improve the discerning precision for the pornographic picture. In the first step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the picture to be inspected is inputted to the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for the first stage of inspection. The frame is about the design of mathematic algorithm. The mathematic algorithm is designed to perform feature discerning. The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is set with a pornographic feature discerning value. In the step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the inspection system for pornographic picture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> fetches the feature data from the input picture to be inspected. The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> used the mathematic algorithm to compute out the feature value for the feature data of the picture to be inspected. Then it enters the step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for judgment. The pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> uses the feature data to discern whether or not the picture to be inspected is a pornographic picture. When the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> judges out the pornographic picture, the method enter the step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The inspection system for pornographic picture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> then exports a first judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The first judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a judging result for the picture to be inspected as the pornographic picture. When the feature value of the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is less than the pornographic feature discerning value or the discerning ability is too low to judge, the pornographic picture discerning engine <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> exports the picture to be inspected to the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for the second stage of inspection. In the step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> fetches the feature data of the picture to be inspected and compares features in the database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. When the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> finds the similar pornographic pictures corresponding to the picture to be inspected, similarity comparison is performed for judging the pornographic picture. When the picture to be inspected is judged as a pornographic picture, the process enters the step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The inspection system for pornographic picture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then exports a second judging signal Ds<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second judging signal includes the result for the picture to be inspected as the pornographic picture. When the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> cannot find a similar pornographic picture with more corresponding feature points and the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> cannot judge the picture to be inspected as a pornographic picture, the process enters the step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. A next picture to be inspected is sent to the inspection system for pornographic picture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the inspection is method for pornographic picture is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Since the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to the pornographic picture database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the processing time is longer than that of the pornographic picture discerning engine, the first stage of inspection is set to pornographic discerning on pornographic picture in the pornographic picture discerning engine. The second stage of inspection is set to use the database comparing engine for comparison. For those pornographic picture, judged by the pornographic picture discerning engine are not necessary to be inspected in the database comparing engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Considering the whole, it can reduce the time for inspection and the loading of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In summary, the foregoing preferred embodiment discloses an inspection system for pornographic picture <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and method. The pornographic picture discerning engine and the database comparing engine are used to doubly inspect. First, the picture is performed with a pornographic a discerning engine. Then, the picture which is recognized as a non-pornographic picture is compared with the database. In this manner, the picture can not only be effectively discerned for the known picture stored in the pornographic picture database, but also the newly published picture can also be discerned, so as to increase the capability for discerning pornographic picture. The solid advantages are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 1. The pornographic picture discerning engine directly inspects the picture to be inspected for discerning. It is not necessary to worry about whether the picture to be inspected is the newly published pornographic picture. It can avoid the failure to filter the pornographic picture away due to the pornographic picture database is not updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 2. The database comparing engine can compensate the part, which is hard to be discerned by the pornographic picture discerning engine, so that the pornographic picture can be effectively judged. Particularly, those pornographic pictures which are easily misjudged as a non-pornographic picture by the pornographic picture discerning engine are added to the pornographic picture database so as to improve the discerning capability of the pornographic picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 3. The first stage of inspection is set to pornographic discerning on pornographic picture in the pornographic picture discerning engine. After filtering, the second stage of inspection is set to use the database comparing engine for comparison and check. It can reduce the time consumption and cost used in inspection, and the loading of the system. </paragraph>
