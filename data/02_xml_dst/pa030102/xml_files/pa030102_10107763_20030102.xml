<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) are used for these experiments. Diabetes is induced in some of the rats by a tail vein injection of streptozocin, 85 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours later, 4 groups of diabetic rats are given a single dose of the test compound (0.001 to 100 mg/kg) by oral gavage. Animals are sacrificed 4-6 hours after dosing and blood and sciatic nerves are harvested. Tissues and cells are extracted with 6% perchloric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Sorbitol in erythrocytes and nerves is measured by a modification of the method of R. S. Clements et al.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The activity and thus utility of the compounds of the present invention as medical agents in providing protection from ischemic damage to tissue in a mammal can be demonstrated by the activity of the compounds in the in vitro assay described below and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,581, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. This assay is more particularly directed to providing protection from ischemic damage to myocardial tissue (e.g., for inducing cardioprotection). The assay also provides a means whereby the activities of the compounds of the present invention can be compared with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for inducing protection from ischemia, particularly in the myocardium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Cardioprotection, as indicated by a reduction in infarcted myocardium, can be induced pharmacologically using adenosine receptor agonists in isolated, retrogradely perfused rabbit hearts as an in vitro model of myocardial ischemic preconditioning (Liu et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 28:1057-1061, 1994; and Tracey et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 28:410-415, 1997). The in vitro test described below demonstrates that a test compound (i.e., a compound of formula I of the present invention) can also pharmacologically induce cardioprotection, i.e., reduced myocardial infarct size, when administered to a rabbit isolated heart. The effects of the test compound are compared to ischemic preconditioning and the A1/A3 adenosine agonist, APNEA (N<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-&lsqb;2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl&rsqb;adenosine), that has been shown to pharmacologically induce cardioprotection in the rabbit isolated heart (Liu et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 28:1057-1061, 1994). The exact methodology is described below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The protocol used for these experiments closely follows that described by Liu et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 28:1057-1061, 1994. Male New Zealand White rabbits (3-4 kg) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.v.). After deep anesthesia is achieved (determined by the absence of an ocular blink reflex) the animal is intubated and ventilated with 100% O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>using a positive pressure ventilator. A left thoracotomy is performed, the heart exposed, and a snare (2-0 silk) is placed loosely around a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery, approximately &frac23; of the distance towards the apex of the heart. The heart is removed from the chest and rapidly (&lt;30 cc) mounted on a Langendorff apparatus. The heart is retrogradely used via the aorta in a non-recirculating manner with a modified Krebs solution (NaCl 118.5 mM, KCl 4.7 mM, Mg SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>1.2 mM, KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>1.2 mM, NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>24.8 mM, CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>2.5 mM, and glucose 10 mM), at a constant pressure of 80 mmHg and a temperature of 37&deg; C. Perfusate pH is maintained at 7.4-7.5 by bubbling with 95% O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Heart temperature is tightly controlled by using heated reservoirs for the physiological solution and water jacketing around both the perfusion tubing and the isolated heart. Heart rate and left ventricular pressures are determined via a latex balloon which is inserted in the left ventricle and connected by stainless steel tubing to a pressure transducer. The intraventricular balloon is inflated to provide a systolic pressure of 80-100 mmHg, and a diastolic pressure less than or equal to 10 mmHg. Perfusate flow rates are routinely determined throughout the experimental period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The heart is allowed to equilibrate for 30 min, over which time the heart must show stable left ventricular pressures within the parameters outlined above. If the heart rate falls below 180 bpm at any time prior to the 30 min period of regional ischemia, the heart is paced at &ap;200 bpm for the remainder of the experiment. ischemic preconditioning is induced by total cessation of cardiac perfusion (global ischemia) for 5 min, followed by reperfusion for 10 min. The global ischemia/reperfusion is repeated one additional time, followed by a 30 min regional ischemia. The regional ischemia is provided by tightening the snare around the coronary artery branch. Following the 30 min regional ischemia, the snare is released and the heart reperfused for an additional 120 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Pharmacological cardioprotection is induced by infusing the test compound at predetermined concentrations, starting 30 min prior to the 30 min regional ischemia, and continuing until the end of the 120 min reperfusion period. Hearts which receive test compounds do not undergo the two periods of ischemic preconditioning. The reference compound, APNEA (500 nM) is perfused through hearts (which do not receive the test compound) for a 5 min period which ends 10 min before the 30 min regional ischemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> At the end of the 120 min reperfusion period, the coronary artery snare is tightened, and a 0.5% suspension of fluorescent zinc cadmium sulfate particles (1-10 &mgr;M) is perfused through the heart; this stains all of the myocardium, except that area at risk for infarct development (area-at-risk). The heart is removed from the Langendorff apparatus, blotted dry, weighed, wrapped in aluminum foil and stored overnight at &minus;20&deg; C. The next day, the heart is sliced into 2 mm transverse sections from the apex to just above the coronary artery snare. The slices are stained with 1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 37&deg; C. Since TTC reacts with living tissue (containing NAD-dependent dehydrogenases), this stain differentiates between living (red stained) tissue, and dead tissue (unstained infarcted tissue). The infarcted area (no stain) and the area-at-risk (no fluorescent particles) are calculated for each slice of left ventricle using a precalibrated image analyzer. To normalize the ischemic injury for difference in the area-at-risk between hearts, the data is expressed as the ratio of infarct area vs. area-at-risk (%IA/AR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The activity and thus utility of the compounds of the present invention as medical agents in providing protection from ischemic damage to tissue in a mammal can be further demonstrated by the activity of the compounds in the in vitro assay described below. The assay also provides a means whereby the activities of the compounds of the present invention can be compared with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for inducing protection from ischemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The activity of a sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor in a tissue can be determined by testing the amount of sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor that is required to raise tissue sorbitol (i.e., by inhibiting the further metabolism of sorbitol consequent to blocking sorbitol dehydrogenase) or lower tissue fructose (by inhibiting its production from sorbitol consequent to blocking sorbitol dehydrogenase). While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that a sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor, by inhibiting sorbitol dehydrogenase, prevents or reduces ischemic damage as described hereinafter in the following paragraph and scheme, appearing at column 9 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,581, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When the supply of oxygenated blood to a tissue is interrupted or slowed down (ischemia) the cells in the oxygen-deficient tissue derive their energy (ATP) from glucose via glycolysis (which does not require the presence of oxygen). Glycolysis also requires a supply of NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and in an ischemic tissue the length of time glycolysis can be maintained becomes sensitive to the supply of NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. However, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) also utilizes NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> but does not produce an increase in ATP. Thus, it follows that preventing or retarding NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> use by SDH with sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDIs) will enhance or prolong the ability of ischemic tissue to carry out glycolysis, i.e., to produce energy in the absence of oxygen and in turn enhance and prolong the survival of the cells in the tissue. Since inhibition of SDH will retard depletion of the tissue&apos;s NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, a sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor is an effective anti-ischemic agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Again, the activity of a sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor can be determined by the amount of sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor that is required to raise tissue sorbitol or lower tissue fructose. Male Sprague-Dawley rats are rendered diabetic by injection of streptozocin at 55 mg/kg, i.v., in pH 4.5 citrate buffer. They are fed ad libitum in controlled conditions of housing, temperature and lighting. After five weeks of diabetes, the rats are anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital, and tissues are rapidly removed and analyzed for sorbitol and fructose. Sorbitol levels are analyzed according to the method of Donald M. Eades et al., &ldquo;Rapid Analysis of Sorbitol, Galactitol, Mannitol and Myoinositol Mixtures From Biological Sources,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography, </italic></highlight>490, 1-8, (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Fructose in rat tissues is enzymatically measured using a modification of the method of Ameyama (<highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>89:20-29 1982), in which ferricyamide was replaced by resazurin, a dye that is reduced to the highly fluorescent resorufin. The amount of resorufin fluorescence is stoichiometric with the amount of fructose oxidized by fructose dehydrogenase. The assay contains 0.1 ml neutralized 6% perchloric acid nerve extract in a final volume of 1.5 ml. Following incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature in a closed drawer, sample fluorescence is determined at excitation&equals;560 nm, emission&equals;580 nm with slits of 5 mm each on a Perkin-Elmer model 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fructose concentrations are calculated by comparison with a series of known fructose standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor compounds of the present invention are thus useful in reducing or minimizing damage effected directly to any tissue that may be susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury (e.g., heart, brain, lung, kidney, liver, gut, skeletal muscle, retina) as the result of an ischemic event (e.g., myocardial infarction). A compound of the present invention is therefore usefully employed prophylactically to prevent, i.e. (prospectively or prophylactically) to blunt or stem, tissue damage (e.g., myocardial tissue) in patients who are at risk for ischemia (e.g., myocardial ischemia). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor compounds of the present invention are particularly well suited to the treatment of diabetic patients because of increased metabolism through sorbitol dehydrogenase in the diabetic state. The compounds of the present invention are also well suited for prophylactic use with non-diabetic patients who have actually suffered or who are considered at risk of suffering from ischemic events (e.g., myocardial ischemia). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula I of the present invention may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by a variety of conventional routes of administration, including orally, parenterally, topically and rectally, as described further below. In general, compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be administered orally or parenterally at dosages between about 0.001 and about 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject to be treated per day, preferably from about 0.01 to 10 mg/kg, in single or divided doses. However, some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The individual responsible for dosing will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Mutual prodrugs of compounds of formula I and aldose reductase inhibitors, as described below, will generally be administered orally or parenterally at dosages between about 0.001 and about 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject to be treated per day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg, in single or divided doses. Compositions containing both a compound of the formula I and an aldose reductase inhibitor will generally be administered orally or parenterally at dosages between about 0.001 and about 100 mg of each active component (i.e., the compound of formula I and the aldose reductase inhibitor) per kg body weight of the subject to be treated per day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> In the aspects of this invention related to therapeutic methods of treating or preventing diabetic complications wherein a compound of formula I of this invention and a Second Agent are administered together as part of the same pharmaceutical composition and to methods wherein these two agents are administered separately, the appropriate dosage regimen, the amount of each dose administered and the intervals between doses of the active agents will again depend upon the compound of formula I of this invention and the Second Agent being used, the type of pharmaceutical compositions being used, the characteristics of the subject being treated and the severity of the condition, disease, symptom or complication being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> The compounds of the present invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles, diluents or carriers, in either single or multiple doses. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining the compounds of formula I of the present invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, vehicles or diluents are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, powders, lozenges, syrups, injectable solutions and the like. These pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus, for purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate or talc are often useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials for this include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> For parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds of the present invention in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol, or in sterile aqueous solutions may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily available by standard techniques known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> Administration of the compounds of, formula I of the present invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of the present invention preferentially to the desired tissue (e.g., nerve, kidney, retina and/or cardiac tissues). These methods include oral, parenteral, topical, intraduodenal, rectal, inhalation routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of the present invention are administered in single (e.g., once daily) or multiple doses or via constant infusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Generally, a compound of formula I of the present invention is administered orally, or parenterally (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary). Topical administration may also be indicated, for example, where the patient is suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder or whenever the medication is best applied to the surface of a tissue or organ as determined by the attending physician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> The amount and timing of compounds administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the severity of the affliction, on the manner of administration and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus, because of patient to patient variability, the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician may titrate doses of the drug to achieve the treatment that the physician considers appropriate for the patient. In considering the degree of treatment desired, the physician must balance a variety of factors such as age of the patient, presence of preexisting disease, as well as presence of other diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, in one mode of administration the compounds of formula I of the present invention may be administered just prior to surgery (e.g., within twenty-four hours before surgery, for example, cardiac surgery) during or subsequent to surgery (e.g., within twenty-four hours after surgery) where there is risk of myocardial ischemia. The compounds of formula I of the present invention may also be administered in a chronic daily mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of formula I of this invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or diluent. Thus, the compounds of formula I of this invention can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral, rectal or transdermal dosage form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> For purposes of transdermal (e.g., topical) administration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1% to 5% concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of an active ingredient, i.e, a compound of formula I of the present invention, are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see <highlight><italic>Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, </italic></highlight>Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may contain, for example, 0.0001%-95% of the compound(s) of the present invention. In any event, the composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the present invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition/complication of the subject being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In the combination aspect of the present invention, a compound of formula I of the present invention and a Second Agent, as described above, can be co-administered simultaneously or sequentially in any order, or as a single pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I of the present invention and a Second Agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the treatment of the disease/conditions/complications described herein with a combination of active ingredients which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of formula I, a prodrug thereof or a salt of such compound or prodrug, and a Second Agent as described above. The kit comprises a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows: &ldquo;First Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . &rdquo; etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A &ldquo;daily dose&rdquo; can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a compound of formula I of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the Second Agent can consist of several tablets or capsules or vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula I of the present invention generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In the formulations which follow, &ldquo;active ingredient&rdquo; means a compound(s) of the present invention.
