<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a valve for filling inflatable pouches and associated manufacturing method, and more particularly to a self-sealing valve for non-latex balloons that opens more easily under inflow gas pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Non-latex balloons have become very popular for use in celebrations of all kinds. Typically the balloons include a main body with an intricately formed stem for receiving a nozzle used to inflate the main body of the balloon. A valve is normally positioned partially in the stem and partially extending into the main body to facilitate filling the main body with the appropriate gas, and also to automatically seal when the main body is full of the gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Certain available valves are designed with top and bottom edges of the valve extending to the same length. This requires fairly strict manufacturing tolerances, and oftentimes the two even edges of the valve portion improperly divert the inflow gas pressure to fold the valve member, which keeps the valve from popping open, thus causing the stem of the balloon to burst under the inflow gas pressure. If the valve portion is sealed even slightly away from the even edges, then the valve is likely not to open under the inflow gas pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other presently available valves require the nozzle to be inserted into the valve inside the stem. Inserting the nozzle into the valve, which is positioned inside the stem, potentially damages the valve and the airtight seal between the valve and the balloon material. The valves in the stem have been designed to automatically open under typical inflow gas pressure. The nozzle is normally first inserted into the stem, and the gas is then turned on. The inflow gas pressure from the nozzle is typically, although not consistently, adequate to open the self-sealing valve to allow the flow of gas into the main body. Some valves are positioned inside the stem such that insertion of the nozzle into the stem automatically inserts the nozzle into the valve. These types of valves are easily damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another available valve has the leading edges extending beyond the stem portion. This requires the valve to be opened by hand to insert the nozzle. This typically requires two hands to open the valve and hold the balloon, which is slow and awkward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing most of these valves, many problems are normally encountered as a result of alignment problems in assembling the valves, and attaching the assembled valves to the balloon material. Typically, balloon valves are first separately assembled, or purchased pre-assembled, and then in a separate assembly step are positioned to extend from the stem into the main body of the balloon while the halves of the balloon are attached together and sealed generally around their perimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Some problems associated with present manufacturing techniques include the variability of valve positioning in the balloon stem. In addition, the valves are normally purchased from an outside source and must be inserted into the balloon during the manufacturing step, as discussed above. This can result in problems related to inadequate supplies and subjects the user to quality and demand variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is with the above-mentioned inadequacies that the balloon valve, and associated manufacturing method, of the present invention have been developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a solution to the problems set forth above, and regards the provision of a valve for use in automatically allowing gas or liquid to flow into an interior chamber of a bag, and a related method of manufacturing the valve, the valve having a unique seal structure to facilitate the reliable opening of a valve member under inlet gas or liquid pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the invention relates to a bag for holding a gas or liquid, the bag including a main body having a stem portion, the main body defining an interior space and formed from a front and back sheet sealed together about a peripheral edge. The stem defines an inlet aperture at a free end thereof. A valve member has a width dimension positioned in the stem for use in inflating the main body, the valve member including a flexible front layer and a flexible back layer. The front layer is adjacent to the front sheet, and the back layer is adjacent to the back sheet. Both the front and back layers define opposing elongated edges. The front and back layers are attached together along the elongated sides to form a seal. The valve member has an inlet end and an outlet end, the inlet end is adjacent to the inlet aperture, and the outlet end is positioned in communication with the interior chamber of the main body. A front valve seal is formed between the top layer of the valve member and the top sheet of the stem portion. The top valve seal is positioned adjacent to the inlet end of the valve member, the front valve seal extending substantially perpendicularly from the longitudinal edges of the valve member and curves forwardly toward said inlet end of said valve member at a central location across said width dimension to define a front leading edge. A bottom valve seal is formed between the bottom layer of the valve member and the bottom sheet of the stem portion. The bottom valve seal is positioned adjacent to the inlet end of the valve member, and the back valve seal extends substantially perpendicularly from the longitudinal edges of the valve member and curves forwardly toward the inlet end of the valve member at a central location across the width dimension to define a back leading edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A method for manufacturing the valve member in a bag for containing a gas or liquid is also disclosed. The bag includes a front sheet, a back sheet, and a stem. It also includes a valve having a front side and a back side. A seal is formed between the front sheet of the balloon and the front side of the seal, and between the back side of the valve and the back sheet of the balloon. The method comprises the steps of providing a double-wound roll of valve material; providing a single-wound roll of back sheet material; providing a single-wound roll of front sheet material; forming longitudinal seals in said valve material to form individual valve members; separating adjacent individual valve members; spacing said adjacent individual valve members apart; forming the seal between the back sheet material and the back side of the individual valve member; applying the front sheet material to the combination of the valve member and the back sheet material; forming a seal between the back sheet material and the front sheet material; and forming a seal between the front sheet material and the front side of the individual valve member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A more complete appreciation of the present invention and its scope can be obtained from the accompanying drawings, which are briefly summarized below, and the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; refers to any inflatable bag having a main body and an associated inflation stem. An inflation valve could be inside the stem, or inside a pouch which acts as a valve to allow air into a separate pouch, such as an internal chamber in a multi-chambered inflatable bag. Also, in the description provided below, examples are described utilizing gaseous material, while the invention is believed to work equally well with liquid material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an inflated non-latex balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> incorporating the present invention is shown. The balloon main body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is made of a front sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sealed together about their corresponding peripheral edges <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to create an airtight interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed at a bottom end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the balloon. A valve member (not shown), having a front and back layer, is positioned in the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and extends into the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the balloon. The front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back sheets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are sealed to the front and back layers of the valve member, respectively, to form a front and back valve seal of the present invention, as is described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is filled with a desired gas, such as helium or air, from a nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> connected to a source tank, such as a compressed gas cylinder (not shown). A free end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the stem defines an inlet aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into which the nozzle is inserted prior to filling the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Once the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is inserted into the inlet aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (and into a stem chamber <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), the gas is allowed to flow from the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The inflow gas pressure flows to impact and affect the front transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed between the front valve sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the front balloon sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the back transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> formed between the back valve sheet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the back balloon sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which automatically opens the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> under the inflow gas pressure to allow the gas to flow through the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and into the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the balloon. When the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adequately full, the inflow gas is terminated at the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the higher gas pressure inside the interior chamber collapses the front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sheets of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> together to trap the gas inside the balloon. Typically, the length of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> inside the interior chamber of the balloon can fold over onto itself as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to further assist in sealing the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A string or ribbon <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or other handling device can be attached to the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thus the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets of balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> material are typically constructed of a layer of biaxially oriented nylon having an aluminum film on the external side and a polyethylene film on the internal side. The film on the internal side can also be linear low polyethylene, which forms a better seal than normal polyethylene. Each of the front and back sheets are typically approximately 0.00125 inches (1 and &frac14; mil) in total thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention is positioned inside the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extends continuously from inside the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a distance of approximately 4-7 inches inside the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The valve member has an inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and an outlet end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, with the valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> being formed adjacent to the inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is positioned in the stem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the outlet end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is positioned in the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is made of a front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> layer of very thin polyethylene film, preferably 1 to 1 &frac12; mils thick. The valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an elongated rectangular shape defining opposing elongated side edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sheets are sealed together at <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> along the side edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is typically &frac12; to 1 inch wide, and approximately 5-12 inches long. A channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed along the entire length of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the opposing elongated sealed side edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to allow the flow of the input gas therethrough. The channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is normally in a closed position, which does not facilitate gas flow. The front and back layers of the valve member can be separated from one another, such as by the inflow gas pressure as described hereafter, to form the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which facilitates the flow of gas therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> balloon sheets are sealed to the front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> valve layers, respectively, forming a front transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a back transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The shape of the front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> valve seals is preferably identical. The front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> valve seals are formed across the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> near the main body of the bottom <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and fix the balloon sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adjacent to the inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the valve member. The shape of the transverse seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are important to the operation of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> formed between the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> balloon sheets and the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> hold the valve member in its proper position with respect to the balloon. The front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> transverse valve seals are formed, as is explained in greater detail below, after the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is assembled. The valve member is not as wide as the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the balloon, so the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets of the balloon are sealed directly together along the front <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> valve seals where the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is absent, such as near the edges <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a seal-blocking material, such as high temperature blocking ink <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or a non-sealable material (e.g. polyester or teflon) is applied to the interior side <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the back layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of valve film (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to prevent the top <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> valve layers from being sealed together during the formation of the front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> transverse valve seals. The blocking material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned on the interior side <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the back layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of valve material, and does not cover the longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the back sheet <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so as to not interfere with the longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The shape of the valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are fundamental to its improved performance in opening the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed along the length of the valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during the filling process. The valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are effectively a continuation of the edge seal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which attaches the perimeter of the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extend from the edge seals <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> towards the axial center line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the stem portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Again, preferably each seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is identically shaped in a central region of the stem portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> substantially symmetric to the axial center line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extend in a smooth curve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> towards the inlet aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to form a leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In other words, the valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are symmetrical about the axial center line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and extends from a forwardly positioned leading edge and slopes rearwardly and outwardly to terminate at substantially right angles with the edge seams <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the stem portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The width of each valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> adjacent the edges of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is approximately &frac18; inches. The width of the valve seal at the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the valve seal is approximately {fraction (3/16)} inches. The width of each valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is greater at the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> than at the outer edges adjacent the stem edge seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The change in thickness is preferably gradual. The valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> define two internal volumes in the balloon, the first being coextensive with the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the main body, and the second volume <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> being defined inside the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The only passageway between the two chambers is the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through the valve member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A lift region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed on either side of the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and is defined on one side by the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, on a second side by the valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as it extends toward the edge seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and on a third side by the edge seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lift region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is open on the side towards the inlet aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Identical lift regions are formed relative to transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The importance of the lift regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail below. The distance between the inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is between 0 and {fraction (5/16)} of an inch for valve widths of &frac12; to approximately 1 inch. The distance between the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the valve seal and the inlet end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is generally related to the width of the valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> itself. The larger the width, the greater the allowable distance. The front valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is preferably identical to and positioned co-extensively with the back valve seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. However, exact coextensive alignment between the front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back valve seals <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is not necessary, as it has been found that the leading edges of the valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be misaligned by up to approximately &frac14; inch and still properly function. Preferably the offset between the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the top <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> valve seals would be no more than approximately {fraction (1/16)} of an inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the operation of the inventive valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The valve of the present invention is shown in the unused state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, prior to the insertion of the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the inlet aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed in the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is first inserted through the inlet aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, after which the inflow gas is released. The inflow gas typically flows from the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a pressure of approximately 10 PSI. The inflow gas initially enters the chamber <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> formed inside the stem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and expands the chamber <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> as shown. The inflow gas quickly contacts the leading edge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> valve seals, and is diverted into the lift regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed on either side of the front and back leading edges of the valve seals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The inlet gas pressure exerts a force on the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the lift regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> surrounding the top and bottom valve seals, as well as along the walls of the stem, and generates an outwardly directed force on the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets if the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets are attached to the front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> layers of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, and as the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets spread apart, they each pull their respective portion of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> apart, and act to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; open the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed through the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>. Once the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been formed by the inlet gas pressure, the gas then travels through the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into the interior chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the balloon to fill the balloon with gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adequately filled with gas, the user terminates the inlet gas flow at the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> causing the gas to stop flowing through the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Since the pressure of the gas inside the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is greater than atmospheric pressure, the channel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is closed by the higher internal pressure exerted on the front <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> layers of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The balloon is thus filled with the desired gas through the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having inventive valve seals <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The advantages of the inventive valve seals are that they provide more certain valve opening to reduce valve malfunction, and they are insensitive to manufacturing variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> show a manufacturing process by which the novel balloon valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention is assembled and incorporated into a non-latex balloon, as is described hereinafter. Generally, the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided to a vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which grips the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and upon which three operations are performed. The first operation is the formation of the longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of each individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at seal operation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, then the individual valves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are separated from one another at a cutting operation <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and then the valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned at the appropriate location on a supply of back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> where the back transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed between the back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheet material and the back layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The combined valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> move beyond the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the next stage where the front sheet material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the combination valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and finally onto a stamp operation <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> where the front valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed between the front sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the balloon material and the front layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, while at the same time the perimeters <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sheets are heat sealed together and cut to form the balloon shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the valve material (front and back layers) is preferably double wound on a free-wheeling unwind roller <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which has a brake, such as an air brake known in the art, for selectively controlling the web tension, and thus the rate at which the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is released from the unwind roller <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> allows the integral production of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the application of the valve member to the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during production of the balloon. The double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is continuous in the length dimension, limited only by the practicality of roller sizes, and is as wide as the resulting valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is long. The seal proof blocking material is preprinted in the appropriate spaced positions along the length of the interior side of the valve material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as described above. The valve material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removed from the unwind roller past an optical scanner <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is sensitive to the blocking material markings on the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and thus senses the position of the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and rate of movement and is used to control the timing of the edge seal <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, cut <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and valve seal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The valve material then passes under an idler roller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and over the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has stationary baffles <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> defining three fixed position vacuum levels around the circumference of the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The vacuum is applied through apertures (not shown) formed in the cylinder walls <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The first vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has a variable vacuum level, and can be set at either a high level of vacuum for securing the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, or a low level of vacuum to allow the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to slide over this area of the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The second vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a relatively medium level of vacuum, and the third vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has no vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is initially gripped by the first vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> under high vacuum and is held tightly thereto. The vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is driven to pull the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the unwind roller <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The air brake on the unwind roller <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> controls the removal of valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the unwind roller. While under the effect of the high vacuum pressure, the edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed at operation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed at the edge seal operation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The edge seal operation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> heat seals the front and back layers of valve material together to form the edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which extends along the width of the double wound valve material (which defines the length of the individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). The edge seal mechanism <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (thermo-heat seal bar) is designed to form the longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the spaced apart blocking material patterns positioned on the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The edge seal mechanism <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> forms adequate seals in the valve material at 350 degrees Fahrenheit with a dwell time of 0.25 seconds under 50 PSI. The edge seal mechanism <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> can be designed to form an unsealed region between adjacent seals of different valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow air to escape from the sealed areas to avoid bubbles in the seal and to form a better seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotates to pull the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> off of the unwind reel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and move the sealed valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> towards the cutting station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. At the cutting station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> the width of the double wound material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is cut along each longitudinal seal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to separate the individual valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the continuous double wound valve material. The cutting station can utilize any suitable cutting technique, such as a hot cut system, a rotary cut system, or a flying knife cut system. Any of these cutting systems are suitable for cutting along the longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of each individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At the cutting operation <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, an individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, while still formed as part of continuous double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, is advanced past the cutting blade <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to a position where the cutting blade is aligned with one of the longitudinal seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> formed at the edge seal operation. The cutting blade <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> slices through the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> through the longitudinal edge seals <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to which it is aligned to separate an individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the continuous double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. At this point the air brake on the unwind reel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is applied to resist movement of the unwind reel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the vacuum in the first vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is lowered to allow the supply of valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the vacuum cylinder to slip over the vacuum cylinder as it is advanced the width of one individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to space the previously separated valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> away from the end of the double wound valve material for the reasons set forth below. The air brake is then released, and high vacuum pressure is resumed in first vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is advanced the width of one valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so the next adjacent longitudinal seal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is aligned with the cutting blade <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in order to allow the cutting blade to slice through the seal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>and separate the next valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the continuous double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. At this point the air brake on the unwind reel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is applied again, and the vacuum in the first vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is reduced, while the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotates to advance the newly cut valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> one valve member width away from the end of the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This process is repeated to space the individually cut valve members away from each other for the subsequent back transverse seal operation, described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the air brake is applied on the unwind roller <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the vacuum in the first vacuum chamber is reduced, the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotates a predetermined distance, such as the width of an individual valve member, which causes the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to break the vacuum seal and slide underneath the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air brake is strong enough to overcome the vacuum grip between the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to allow the valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to stay stationary as the cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotates underneath it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The individually spaced valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, during this process, are stepped towards the back transverse seal formation station <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> where the back transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed between the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the balloon material and the back layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The three separate vacuum chambers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the surface of the vacuum cylinder are created by a set of three baffles <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> positioned stationarily inside the rotating vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The variable (high to low) vacuum level portion (first vacuum chamber) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is defined between baffle A and baffle B, baffle A being positioned to extend radially from the axial seal <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> at the center of the vacuum cylinder to the outer wall of the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at a position approximately adjacent to the location where the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> contacts the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Baffle B is positioned approximately adjacent and in line with the edge cutting device and forms the first vacuum chamber between axial seal <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and baffles A and B. The vacuum cylinder rotates, for instance, clockwise in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, while the baffles A and B remain stationary so the vacuum areas remain relatively stationary regardless of the movement of the vacuum cylinder over the baffles <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The second vacuum area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is defined between the axial seal <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, baffle B and baffle C. Baffle C is positioned between the axial seal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and extends radially to the outer wall of the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> approximately adjacent to, and just beyond, the back transverse seal station <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. This second vacuum area <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> correlates to where the spaced individual valve members are transported from the cutting station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the back transverse seal forming station <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The third vacuum area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is defined between the baffle C and the baffle A. There is no vacuum in this area, and possibly can even have positive pressure, to allow any unintentionally retained valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to fall from the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> before the cylinder rotates to the position where the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> engages the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> advances the spaced apart individual valve members to the back transverse seal forming position <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be sealed in this operation is oriented over the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of balloon material at an orientation to match where the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the balloon will finally be formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The back transverse seal operation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a stamp <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is positioned adjacent to but spaced away from the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is selectably moveable to engage the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at the position to seal the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by forming the back transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as described above. The individual valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when positioned on the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the proper location and sealed thereto, disconnects from the vacuum cylinder (the seal overcomes the force created by the vacuum pressure), and moves along with the continuous back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the next station, described below. During the transverse seal step, the die stamp <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is heated to a high temperature, such as 375 degrees Fahrenheit while the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> remains cool, and the impression of the die stamp <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> against the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> engages the appropriate portions of the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto the appropriate portions of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and under the heat and pressure seals the two together in the desired shape as defined on the die stamp <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, such as the inventive seal shape discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The two sides <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not sealed together due to the blocking material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> positioned therebetween which resists the heat seal. The individual valve members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are spaced apart during the back valve seal forming operation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> since the back transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends beyond the edges of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the edges of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and if the adjacent valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was positioned too close, it would interfere with the formation of the back valve seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The transverse seal operation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is synchronized to be performed at the same time as the cutting operation <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is synchronized to be performed at the same time as the longitudinal edge seals are formed at operation <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> since the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is moved in between each of these operations to advance the double wound valve material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> around the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, it is important to note that the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is functionally continuous in length, and has a width sufficient to allow one side of the balloon shape to be stamped therefrom. To minimize material waste, since the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends from the general shape of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in this case a circle, the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned at an angle to the length and width of the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. To facilitate this angular placement of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the appropriate location on the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the vacuum cylinder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> must be oriented at an angle to the flow of the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to position the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> appropriately at an angle on the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The outline of the balloon in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is representative only of the orientation of the balloon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be stamped out of the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the end of the process, in order to show the orientation of the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After the back transverse seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has been formed between the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the balloon material, the back sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the balloon material continues towards the final stamping operation <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Before reaching the final stamping operation <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the front sheet material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the back sheet material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> co-extensively thereto and together pass through the final stamping operation <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. At the final stamping operation, the front transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed between the front sheet of the balloon <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the front layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> across the stem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as described above. In addition, the perimeters of the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> balloon sheets are sealed together to form peripheral edge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and cut out of the continuous front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> coextensive balloon sheet material to form the finished product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The stamp <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> used at the final stamping operation is positioned above the layered material and the layered material rests on a platten against which the stamp <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> engages to form the front transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the perimeter seal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the front <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> balloon sheets, and to cut the finished product out of the raw material. The final stamping operation <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> preferably operates as frequently as the longitudinal edge sealer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the cutting operation <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the back valve seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> forming operation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to coordinate the flow of material through the manufacturing process. At the final stamping operation <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, an adequate seal is formed at 350 degrees Fahrenheit during the seal dwell time of 1.0 seconds, with a seal pressure of 50 PSI. This manufacturing method can be used to apply any of a variety of valve member seal shapes to valve members, form valve members, and to apply the valves to the balloons, in one manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The fact that the front transverse valve seal <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the back transverse valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> seal are capable of operating even when offset to the extent described above permits the separate forming of the front <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> valve seals at different steps, and can tolerate some variance in relative positioning through the manufacturing process. This allows the manufacturing process to operate over a wider spectrum of alignment because the equipment does not have to be as precisely aligned, which alleviates certain manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, and a manufacturing method therefore, and many of its improvements, have been described with a degree of particularity. The previous description is a preferred example for implementing the invention, and the scope of the invention should not necessarily be limited by this description. The scope of the present invention is defined by the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
