<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an information management method for deterring data leaks, enabling a search and inspection of the data when data is copied to a recording medium from a personal computer within an organization and a search of the records of the process used to copy the data to the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Important data of an organization is generally specified with an implementation rule and regulated so it may used only for the limited purposes within the organization. When it is requested to use such data outside the organization, a user intentionally encrypts the data and decodes such data at the time of use through user authentication by inputting a password or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When such an implementation is used, a data leak can happen to the outside of an organization with transmission of secret data using E-mail or the like. One way of deterring such a data leak is taken through employment of monitoring the E-mails with a mail server or the like on the intra-organization (corporation) network. However, if a recording medium (such as a floppy disk) containing recorded data travels with a person outside of the organization, it is impossible to deter such illegal action. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been proposed considering the problems explained above. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method to prevent illegal data leaks by copying the data to a recording medium and then carrying the medium to an outside organization, and to prevent illegal use of secret data recorded in the relevant medium and enable search and inspection of data after the data is copied and encrypted in the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In preventing an unauthorized leak or use of data, one exemplary embodiment of the information management method of the present invention is accessing a authorization medium, when copying a data recorded in a first recording medium in an information processing apparatus to a second recording medium and executing the copying when an authorization permitting the copying from the first recording medium can be read from the authorization medium or refusing the copying when the authorization cannot be read. The authorization medium executes the copying process when the information permitting copy from the first recording medium can be read from the authorization medium or deters the copying process when the copy permitting information cannot be read out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, since it is possible that an administrator within the organization previously sets, to the authorization medium, the information permitting the copying of data to the second recording medium from the first recording medium and thereby to lend this authorization medium to only a person who is permitted to conduct the copying operation, the illegal copying of data by the third party can be deterred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this information management method, it is preferable that a copying destination range information for designating the destination range of copying is recorded to the authorization medium generated for information management, and the copying process is executed when the second recording medium is matched with the copying destination range information. But this copying process is deterred when the second recording medium is not matched with the medium class information. Moreover, if there is provided the structure that the data as the copying process object is encrypted and then recorded in the second recording medium, the data is encrypted. Automatically with the copying operation in the copying operation explained above, if the recording medium is handed over to the third party, illegal data use can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in view of preventing illegal use of data recorded in the recording medium, another exemplary embodiment of the information management method of the present invention is accessing, in a second recording medium, an information permitting the use of a data recorded in a first recording medium, when reading and using a data recorded in the first recording medium and permitting the use of the data when an apparatus can read the information from the second recording medium and refusing the use of data when the apparatus cannot read the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to this exemplary embodiment, since it is possible that an administrator within the organization previously sets, to the second recording medium (for management), the information permitting the read and use of data recorded in the first recording medium to thereby loan the authorization medium to only a person who is permitted to conduct the copying operation, the illegal copying of data by the third party can be deterred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is preferable for protection of data to structure the information management method to provide a structure such that the data recorded in the first recording medium is encrypted, the encrypted data is copied to the authorization medium provided in the information processing apparatus and decoded when the information processing apparatus uses the encrypted data recorded in the authorization medium or the data processed based on the process using the decoded data is encrypted for the write-back process when the processed data is written back for the authorization medium. Thus, one aspect of the present invention is to allow various profiles, which will become apparent from the preferred embodiments and the additional explanation hereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, in preventing an illegal use of a data in the above embodiment, various embodiments can also include a process that is recording a data application number information in the first recording medium and a data application maximum number in the authorization medium, reading, when using the data of the first recording medium, the data application number information and data application maximum number information, comparing the data application number information and data application maximum number information and permitting the use of the data and incrementing the data application number information by one when the data application number does not exceed the data application maximum number and refusing the use of the data when the data application number exceeds the data application maximum number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary embodiment, an information management method can include setting, to a authorization medium, by a first information processing apparatus, an information permitting a copy of a data stored in a first recording medium provided in a second information processing apparatus to a second recording medium and copying, with the second information processing apparatus, the data stored on the first recording medium, to the second recording medium, when the information permitting a copy can be read from the authorization medium. Another exemplary embodiment includes having a first information processing apparatus set to a second recording medium an information permitting the use of a data recorded in a first recording medium with a second information apparatus when the data is read with the second information processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment can include setting, using a first information processing apparatus, to a authorization medium, a copy permitting information of a data recorded in a first recording medium provided in a second information processing apparatus to a second recording medium and an information permitting a use of the data copied to the second recording medium by a third information processing apparatus, copying, using the second information processing apparatus, the data to the second recording medium from the first recording medium when the second information processing apparatus can read the copy permitting information from the authorization medium and enabling the third information processing apparatus to use the data recorded in the second recording medium when the third information processing apparatus can read the data application permitting information from the authorization medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment can include copying a data recorded in a first recording medium provided in a first information processing apparatus to a second recording medium, writing back, using a second information processing apparatus, to the second recording medium, an updated data updated by processing the data recorded in the second recording medium, reading, using the first information processing apparatus, when executing the process to write back the data written back by the second recording medium to the first recording medium, an identification information of an original information processing apparatus in which the data existed from a authorization medium and permitting the write-back process of the data when the first information processing apparatus is identified and refusing the write-back process of data when a first information processing apparatus cannot be identified and/or the identification information cannot be read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment can be an electronic storage medium containing a program embodying an information management method including accessing a authorization medium when an instruction to copy a data recorded in a first recording medium provided in the information processing apparatus to a second recording medium is inputted and executing the instruction to copy when the apparatus can read an information permitting the copy from the first recording medium or the authorization medium and refusing the instruction to copy when the apparatus cannot read the copy permitting information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment can be an electronic storage medium containing a program embodying an information management method that includes accessing a authorization medium before reading and using a data recorded in a first recording medium and permitting the use of the data when the apparatus can read, from a authorization medium, an information permitting the use of data in the first recording medium or refusing the use of the data when the information processing apparatus cannot read the information permitting the use of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment can be an electronic storage medium containing a program embodying an information management method that includes recording at least one process to a authorization medium, including a security information about permitting a copy of a data stored on a first recording medium inserted in a second information processing apparatus to a second recording medium when the information is read with the second information processing apparatus. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Various exemplary aspects and embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. Various other exemplary embodiments will be obvious through the examples provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a recording medium can be, for example, any one of a floppy disk, a compact disk, a digital video disk, a removable hard drive, a zip disk, an optical recording disk and an electronic memory device. Further, a copy destination class or range can be a type of electronic recording media. For example a hard drive or a network drive may be one class or range and floppy disks may be a second class or range. A data application number can be a unique number for identifying either a type of software, a specific software program or a specific copy of a software program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additional terms used herein include a data application validity term, which can be any time period where the use of data or software to access data is authorized. A right information can be any of authorization information, access rights, modification rights, or any other type of authorization as is now known or later devised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Important or secret data of an organization is generally specified with an implementation rule and/or regulation so that it is used only for specified limited purposes within an organization. When someone requests to use the data outside the organization, a user can intentionally encrypt the data and allow the person to decode the data at the time of use through a user authentication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If management is worried about a data leak to the outside of the organization via transmission of secret data using E-mail or the like, E-mails are monitored with a mail server or the like on the intra-organization (corporation) network. However, if a recording medium recording the data is copied by a person belonging to the relevant organization and is illegally carried to the outside of organization, it has been impossible to deter such illegal action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram that explains an exemplary structure and concept used in an exemplary aspect of the present invention. The arrow marks show the flow of the process and possible movement of an IC card and a recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and do not indicate the data transmission via the communication line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues an IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (which is a recording medium for management) in which the security policy for dealing with the secret data is recorded (procedure 1). This management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manipulated by an administrator in charge within the company (organization). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The issued IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then loaned to a data copying operator who is permitted to conduct the copying operation by the administrator. This data copying operator executes, when copying the &ldquo;Intra-Office Only&rdquo; data to the recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> other than the hard disc drive (HDD) from a personal computer provided within the company (organization), the copying operation and encryption of data based on the security policy recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> issued in the procedure 1 and thereby the executed processes are recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (procedure 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> floppy disc is shown as an example of a recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Namely, removable recording mediums such as an external hard disk drive, MO, or ZIP drive other than the built-in hard disk drive and the copying process to a network drive are also considered part of the invention. The process is further explained in the procedure 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the case where the data recorded in this recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is used in a personal computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> other than the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in which the original data is recorded (for example, a mobile computer carried to the outside of the company or a computer provided in a branch office or the like), copy and use of data are possible based on the security policy recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A record of the processes executed is also recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (procedure 3). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the data copying operator who has executed the procedure 2 is capable of carrying the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the outside of the organization, for example, and then using this IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> there. Moreover, the data copying operator (or an administrator who has once received the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> returned from the data copying operator) is capable of lending this IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the other data user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which the processes of the procedures <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are recorded is returned to the management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the purpose of inspection and this IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inspected by the administrator (procedure 4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When it is requested that the file used in the procedure 3 is written back to the computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> where the original file has existed, the data returning process (procedure 5) is executed. The management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an IC card lending-returning management file <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in which the information regarding the lending of IC card in the procedure 1 explained later and the information regarding the return of IC card in the procedure 4 are recorded, a security policy information file <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is referred when the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is issued in the procedure 1 and an inspection information recording file <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for reading and recording the inspection information from the IC card when the IC card is returned in the procedure 4. Moreover, the management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also provided with a card slot for the read/write access for the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (not shown in the figure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The personal computers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are respectively provided with a drive for executing the read/write access to the recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a card slot (not shown in the figure) for executing the read/write access to the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. These drive and card slots also include the structure which is not built in the server or computer and can be realized with the external installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The process program for executing the procedures 1 and 4 is installed in the management server, while the process program for executing the procedures 2 and 5 is installed in the personal computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the process program for executing the procedure 3 is installed in the personal computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the attributes of the information recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this figure, the item number <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> Record of Data Processes is the region for recording the processes (process attribute, ID of the apparatus executing the process, processing time, or the like) when the process is executed with a personal computer in the procedures 2, 3, 5 explained later. The management server sets the other regions in the above procedure 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The reason why an IC card is used as a medium for data management in this embodiment is that an IC card has very excellent characteristics as a security medium, does not have fragileness which can be found in an electronic medium of the related art and can protect perfectly the data written inside thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, using the flowcharts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the practical processing operations of procedure 1 through procedure 4 in the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing an exemplary process (Procedure 1) of an IC card issuing process. The process begins at start <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> first authenticates an administrator at <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, i.e., whether a server operator is a justified administrator or not. If authentication OK at <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> fails, this information is recorded at <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to the inspection information file <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When an operator is authenticated as the justified administrator at <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the IC card issuing process or IC card non-return inspection process is executed at <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> depending on the selection input for the process to be executed at <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. When the IC card issuing process is selected at <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the security policy information is first set at. As this setting process, the condition information such as importance degree of object data and attribute (position, or the like) of an object person for execution of the procedures 2, 3 explained later is inputted with an administrator and a data use limitation information or the like corresponding to the input condition information is edited with reference to the setting of security policy information file <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. As explained above, the various information pieces shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are written into the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The destination of lending, date of lending, date of return of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are recorded in the IC card lending-returning management file <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When the IC card no-return inspection process is selected at <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, the IC card lending-returning management file <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is accessed to check whether the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having passed the return date exists or not. If the IC card having passed the return date is detected, the destination of lending is read and an owner of this IC card is recorded to the inspection information file <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as an offender against the security policy. Moreover, a warning message is notified as required to the offender. The process ends at end <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a second exemplary (procedure 2) data copy and encryption process. The process begins at start <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. A personal computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the company to which the data is to be protected and a software to execute the processes, are installed. The personal computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> authenticates an operator of this computer as a data user who can execute the data process or not using the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This authentication administrator at <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is conducted through collation with the password <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> written in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If authentication administrator fails at <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, it is determined at <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> whether the number of times of authentication has exceeded the maximum number of times of authentication administrator recorded in the IC card or not. When exceeded, the IC card is locked at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> disabling the use. When not exceeded, failure of authentication administrator is recorded at <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and authentication administrator is accepted again at <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Such authentication process is executed with the function of an ordinary IC card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When authentication is executed, whether an operator has the right for copying the data or not is authenticated from an electronic certificate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If the operator does not have the right for copying the data at <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, a warning message is displayed at <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and the warning information is recorded at <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> to a data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After this check is completed, the manipulation is conducted to copy the data located in the position <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> of the object data. The file to be copied is matched with the object file name <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The medium in the drive of the destination of copy is matched with copy object medium class <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. (If copy of the object file is attempted without using the IC card, the process program stops the copying process itself.) If these conditions are not matched, a warning display is executed and a warning record is recorded at <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> in the data processing region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the conditions are matched, the data of the copying sources are read and are then written into the medium <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> as the copy destination. The data is encrypted using the encryption process and an encryption key (not shown) recorded in the IC card. An encryption/decoding program at <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may be provided in the side of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or may be executed with the process program installed in the computer. When these processes are completed, a record of data copy is recorded at <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> in the data processing region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The process ends at <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing another exemplary embodiment of the Encrypted data decoding/application process (procedure 3). The process begins at start <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The process for decoding and using the encrypted data copied in the recording medium as explained above with a personal computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> different from that as the source of copy will be explained. When using such recording medium in this embodiment of the present invention, the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> must be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> First, whether a data user is qualified to execute the data process using the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or not is authenticated at <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. This authentication administrator is conducted at <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> through collation with the password <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> written in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If authentication administrator fails, at <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> when the number of times of authentication has exceeded the maximum number of times of authentication recorded in the IC card, the IC card is locked at <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight>, disabling the use. When not exceeded, failure of authentication is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When authentication is conducted, at <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> whether an operator has the right for copying the data or not is determined from the electronic certificate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If an operator does not have the right for copying the data, a warning message is displayed at <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight> and warning information is recorded at <highlight><bold>587</bold></highlight> to the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the operator has the right for copying the data at <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, a decoding object PC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is read out to check whether the relevant personal computer is the decoding object PC or not at <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. This check may be conducted by previously giving a unique ID to the process program to be installed and then checking the match or by checking the ID for the hardware such as computer and drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the process object PC is confirmed, the maximum number of times of decoding <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and number of times of decoding <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> recorded in the IC card are read out and at <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> it is checked whether the number of times of decoding reaches the maximum number of times of decoding or not. Moreover, the date of decoding (the current date of system) is compared at <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> with the term of validity for decoding <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to check whether the valid term of decoding is expired or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When a PC is found to be different than the process object PC with this check, at <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> if the decoding data has exceeded the permitted maximum number of times of decoding and the term of the decoding, the decoding process is not permitted and a warning message is displayed at <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight> and a warning record is written in the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>587</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the decoding data does not reach the maximum number of times of decoding and within the term of decoding, a decoding object root folder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is read out and the file read out from the recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is copied to the relevant root folder under the encrypted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the application software reads and accesses the copied and encrypted file at <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>, the decoding program uses this access to decode the data for use by the application software. Moreover, when the access is made to write the data processed with the application software to the file, the encryption program uses this access for encryption of data and writes the data to the file. Here, it is also possible to form the structure that this decoding program can be installed to a personal computer for execution like the encryption program even if the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not present. When the decoding process is executed, its record is recorded in the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the number of times of decoding <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is incremented by one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Here, data can be used <highlight><bold>592</bold></highlight> with the application software installed in the personal computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this case, when the input is conducted to instruct the re-storage and printing of data, the right for using the data at <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> read out previously is checked to check whether an operator of the computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has the right for re-storage and printing of data or not at <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight>. When the operator has the right to use the data, re-storage and printing processes are executed at <highlight><bold>594</bold></highlight>. When use of data is to be completed based on the application software <highlight><bold>593</bold></highlight>, traces including the job files are erased <highlight><bold>598</bold></highlight> perfectly not to leave the decoded data in the hard disc of the computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The process ends at end <highlight><bold>599</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing an exemplary example of (the procedure 4) IC card return/inspection process flow. The process begins at start <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> requests to authenticate an administrator at <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and determines whether an operator of the server is a justified administrator or not at <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. If authentication of the administrator fails, this information is recorded in the inspection information file <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. When the operator is authenticated as the justified administrator at <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, manipulation of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> set to the card slot is authenticated at <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and when the number of times of authentication administrator has exceeded the maximum number of times of authentication specified in the IC card at <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>, the IC card is locked at <highlight><bold>647</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When the authentication administrator is completed successfully at <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, the process record recorded in the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read out at <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> to check at <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> whether an action offending against the content recorded in the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or not (actions to which a warning is issued by the system) is recorded. When an offending action is detected, the process for handling an offending action, which is preset in the system (for example, printing of a list of offending actions) is executed at <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the record of process recorded at <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> in the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is copied to the inspection information file <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and when this process is completed, the IC card itself is initialized and the internal data is erased at <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>. The process ends at <highlight><bold>699</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing an exemplary (procedure 5) process for returning the data. The process for writing back, to the computer, the file carried to the outside as a recording medium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after the process at the branch office or the like will now be explained below. The process begins at start <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Whether a data user is qualified to execute the data using the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or not is authenticated at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. When the authentication administrator at <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> fails, a record of defective authentication is written at <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> every time into the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>, when the number of times of authentication has exceeded the maximum number of times of authentication recorded in the IC card, the IC card is locked at <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight>, disabling the use thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When administrator authentication is completed successfully at <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, the right of an operator for copying the data is checked at <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> by reading the electronic certificate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. When the right for copying the data is confirmed at <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> the object data position <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is read to check whether the destination of copy (computer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to which the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set) is the computer in which the object data exists or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If these checks fail, a warning message is displayed at <highlight><bold>755</bold></highlight> and a record of warning is recorded at <highlight><bold>765</bold></highlight> to the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. When the check is completed successfully, a file is decoded at <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> and copied at <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> to write a record of copy at <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> to the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The process ends at <highlight><bold>799</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The processes in each procedure executed in the management server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or personal computers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> have been explained depending on the preferred embodiments. Moreover, an outline of the processes in the procedures 2, 3 and 5 will be explained below using an example of data recorded in the IC card with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of procedures 2, 3 and 5. The part given the sign o can be processed and the part given the sign x cannot be processed. Moreover, &ldquo;Record of Use&rdquo; and &ldquo;Record of Offense&rdquo; are respectively recorded to the data process recording region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the case where the data is extracted to FPD4 as a medium other than the built-in hard disk drive from a computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (ID: OFFICEPC) in which the object data <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> &ldquo;ABCOOI.XLS&rdquo; is stored, matching with the copy object medium class <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the IC card is inspected. When matching with the copy object medium class is detected and matching of object file name with &ldquo;*.XLS&rdquo; is detected, data extraction is carried out. Moreover, since the copy object medium class <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is defined as a floppy disc drive, when the medium of the copy object destination is a floppy disc drive, the data is copied. When the copy object destination is a network drive which is not specified in the copy object medium class <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the copy is prohibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When copying the data, the encrypted data is written into the floppy disc drive. Since the PC using data (ID: MyPC) is matched with the decoding object PC name <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> within the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (MyPC), the data copied to the &ldquo;C:&bsol;MyData&rdquo; described in the decoding object root folder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> under the encrypted condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When reading the object file in which the general purpose application is encrypted, the data is decoded. In this example, since the information suggesting no right is set in the decoding data re-use right <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, re-storage and printing of the encrypted data in the general purpose application are prohibited. Here, the encrypted file can be copied to the other folder, but it is impossible to read in direct the data because of encryption and moreover since the folder is the one other than the decoding object root folder <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, decoding is impossible even when the IC card <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The data can be stored in the decoding object folder using the same file name or the other file name by editing the data. In this case, the data is encrypted again. In the case where the object file is returned to the original PC after the use thereof, the PC is checked whether it is the PC (ID: OFFICEPC) where the object data exists or not. When the check result is OK, the data is decoded and then returned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As explained above, when the &ldquo;Intra-Organization Only&rdquo; data is copied to a recording medium in view of carrying the same data outside of the organization, the information to permit the copy of data is required. The information can be on a recording medium (IC card or the like), which is different from the recording medium explained above, but of similar nature. Therefore, executing the management of the recording media (including such copy permitting information) can prevent unauthorized leaks of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the data of a recording medium is to be used, a recording medium having recorded the information for permitting the use of data, which is different from above recording medium is also required. Therefore, unauthorized use and copy of the data can be deterred with execution of the management of this recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when copy and use of data is executed or if implementation fails due to the illegal actions or the like, a record of such execution and implementation is generated and thereby traces and inspections for use of data and illegal use of data (attempted) or the like can be enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification and, thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
