</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When playing golf, soil and grass particles adhere to the surface of a golf ball after hitting the golf ball with a golf club and when the ball lands on the ground surface. These particles are typically cleaned off the ball surface by the use of a towel or brush in order to avoid any adverse effects on the flight or rolling characteristics of the ball. On occasion, it may be necessary to use a cleaning fluid to sufficiently clean the golf ball. Such cleaning fluids are not normally readily available on golf courses and the rotary type devices randomly placed around golf courses, more often than not, contain water only. Further, these rotary devices are only of use when in the golfer&apos;s immediate vicinity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved device and method for cleaning golf balls. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) shows respectively (a) perspective, (b) rear, (c) top, and (d) side views of a cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the form of a mounting ring, and a second section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the form of an elongated lid. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first lower open end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a second upper open end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lower end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted for detachable attachment to a nozzle end of an aerosol can, via conventionally known means, such as those used for detachable attachment of cover caps to aerosol cans. This can include an inwardly protruding rib <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> adjacent the lower end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, for engagement with a recess of the nozzle end of the aerosol can. The lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a first lower open end <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a second upper generally closed end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forms a receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> therewithin, which is sized to receive a golf ball such that the golf ball is freely rotatable therein when the lower end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to the aerosol can nozzle end. As golf balls typically have a diameter of 42.5 to 43.7 mm, receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should have a diameter of around 45 mm or larger to ensure free rotation of the golf ball. The lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also includes discharge apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed in the closed end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for the discharge of aerosol. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an alignment protrusion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed at the upper end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the use of which will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pivotable with respect to the mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between an open position as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), at which the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forms the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a closed position, at which the lower end <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> abuts the upper end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thus substantially closes the mounting ring upper end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the closed position. The closed position is used to protect the aerosol can nozzle from accidental discharge, such as when in transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) show respectively (e) perspective and (f) side views of the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> attached to an aerosol can nozzle end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which has a nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a nozzle actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The body of the aerosol can is not shown for simplicity, but as well known, extends downwardly from the nozzle end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>), the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used in the open position. When the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to the nozzle end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and actuator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extend through the mounting ring upper end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The user rotates the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> abuts the alignment protrusion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this position, the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in communication with the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a golf ball (not shown) is inserted into the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the golf ball can be engaged by the aerosol (which preferably includes a cleaning fluid) inside the aerosol can upon actuation of the nozzle actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Discharged aerosol can then exit through discharge apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned such that the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> positions a golf ball received therein in offset relation to the discharge axis of the nozzle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The alignment protrusion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> ensures that discharged aerosol laterally strikes the golf ball, which causes the ball to rotate within the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, the user can adjust the angle of the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to the mounting ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the open position, to ensure optimum contact between discharged aerosol and the golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is frustoconical in shape. It is not limited to this shape however and can be, for example, a cylindrical section. The cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be sized for attachment to any of various commercially available aerosol cans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The hinge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably adapted to retain the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the open position or closed position when the cap is in that position, or the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include any conventional locking means, such as tabs or clips (not shown), to retain the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the open or closed position. The cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also include internal bristles (not shown) arranged within the receptacle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and external bristles (not shown) arranged on the closed end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The external bristles can be used manually to remove large particles of clay and soil from a golf ball prior to cleaning with the aerosol. The external bristles can also be used for cleaning golf club heads. The internal bristles are preferably of length and stiffness so as not to excessively restrict rotation of the golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The internal bristles are not essential to the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may be omitted if they excessively hinder rotation of the golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made of any substance, but preferably polypropylene (APD 160 grade or similar polymer), which is a grade used predominantly in aerosol cover cap manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The aerosol comprises a cleaning solution and a propellant. The cleaning solution is preferably water-based, as water is a low cost solvent into which other co-solvents and surfactants will dissolve. Suitable cleaning additives include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> (a) Ethanol, which is useful in solubilizing green grass stains, of high enough vapour pressure to provide reasonably rapid evaporation, and of a chemical nature which lowers the freezing point of water to prevent &ldquo;icing&rdquo; inside the cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> (b) Surfactants including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> (i) non-ionic types, including ethoxylated linear alcohols and ethoxylated alkyl phenols; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> (ii) anionics, including alkyl aryl sulphonates and olefin sulphonates, sodium alkyl sulphates and sodium alkyl ether sulphates; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> (iii) cationics, including quaternary ammonium compounds; and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> (iv) amphoterics, including cocamidopropyl betaines; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> (c) Sodium polyacrylates which are useful in solubilizing clays and other soils; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (d) Silicone fluids to maintain ball shine and provide a low-friction surface on drying; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> (e) Other additives to ensure appropriate fragrance, viscosity, pH and stability of the formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The cleaning solution should be formulated to work on clays, grass and soils, without affecting any outer polymer coating of the golf balls. The cleaning solution will also assist in lowering the freezing point of water, thereby reducing the propensity of ice formation within the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cleaning solution preferably evaporates at a rate faster than water alone, allowing quicker drying of the golf ball and the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the cleaning solution has a high volatile content to minimise residue drying on a golf ball and thus affecting its weight and in-flight properties. Further, the cleaning solution should not cause internal corrosion of the aerosol can and the interior side of the valve cup. Any surfactants used should be biodegradable. In relation to the cleaning fluid, preference should be given to naturally derived solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Any known propellant which is compatible with the cleaning solution can be used. The propellant should be of sufficient pressure to not only propel the cleaning solution, but also rotate a golf ball received in the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The propellant should be of sufficient quantity to last for the life of the aerosol product, not contravene any statutory or industry guidelines, non-toxic, and, where possible, not contravene any low Volatile Organic Components (VOC) legislation. Where possible, the propellant should be non-flammable. Possible suitable propellants include dimethyl ether, hydrocarbons, compressed nitrogen, compressed air, compressed carbon dioxide, Forane 134a (proprietary name for 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) or Forane 152a (proprietary name for 1,2-diflouoroethane). High pressure hydrocarbons carbons could also be used, including propane/butane blends to obtain pressures of up to 75 psi (0.52 MPa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The combination of the cleaning solution and propellant should comply with government deceptive packaging regulations, and the aerosol generally should comply with Australian Standard AS 2278-2000 and any subsequent issues or additions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention attached to a nozzle end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of an aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a first section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the form of a mounting ring and a second section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the form of a lid. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via a hinge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a first lower open end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a second upper open end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The lower end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is adapted for detachable attachment to the aerosol can nozzle end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a first lower open end <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and a second upper generally closed end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is pivotable with respect to the mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between an open position, at which the lid lower end <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is angularly spaced from the mounting ring upper end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a closed position, at which the ends <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> abut each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thus substantially closes the mounting ring upper end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> form a chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> therewithin in the closed position of the cap. The chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sized to receive a golf ball such that the golf ball is freely rotatable therein when the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to the aerosol can nozzle end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a discharge aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed in the closed end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for the discharge of aerosol. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a nozzle aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which allows access to the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for actuation thereof when the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to the aerosol can nozzle end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes internal bristles <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> arranged within the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and external bristles <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> arranged on the lid closed end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As with the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the hinge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is preferably adapted to retain the lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the closed position when the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in that position, or the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can include any conventional locking means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> dispenses aerosol in a direction substantially in alignment with the axis of the aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In use, the mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is attached to the can nozzle end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is pivoted to the open position via hinge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A golf ball (not shown) to be cleaned is then inserted inside the mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is then pivoted to the closed position, at which the mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> form the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> enclosing the golf ball. The chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> locates the golf ball in dispensing relation to the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and allows the golf ball to be freely rotatable therewithin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In operation, the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is actuated by a user via the nozzle aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which allows the user&apos;s finger to access the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Actuation of the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> dispenses an aerosol from the aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with the stream of aerosol rotating the golf ball within the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, such that the golf ball is engaged by the aerosol. The internal bristles <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can engage the golf ball when the ball is rotating in the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to assist in the cleaning thereof. The discharge aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> allows discharge of aerosol which has passed through the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To assist the rotation of a golf ball by the stream of aerosol, the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be offset in relation to the longitudinal axis of the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passing through the centre of the mounting ring lower end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This will locate a golf ball in offset relation to the axis of the stream of aerosol dispensed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be adapted to discharge the aerosol at an angle in relation to the longitudinal axis of the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As described above, the chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to receive any size golf ball whose dimensions are set and approved by the various Professional Golf Associations. In large diameter aerosol cans, which typically have a diameter greater than 53 mm, the cap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will correspondingly have a large diameter which provides a bigger chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The bigger chamber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows a golf ball to rest slightly off-centre of the axis of the aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, allowing a natural offset discharge of aerosol in relation to the golf ball. The aerosol can <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will typically be tilted during use such that the golf ball rests on the mounting ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lid <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, to ensure the golf ball will be offset in relation to the aerosol discharged from the nozzle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
