<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a vehicle lamp having a control for selectively rendering portions of the lamp light transmissive under vehicle operator control. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> All motor vehicles include a control for switching between high beam and low beam operation of the motor vehicle headlamps. This control may be implemented by a floor mounted switch but most typically in more recent designed motor vehicles is implemented with a stalk on the vehicle steering column that is easily actuated by a motor vehicle operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the high beam option is selected, the vehicle headlamps are focused in a direction that illuminates further in advance of the vehicle to improve a motorist&apos;s ability to see details in his or her line of sight. When an oncoming vehicle approaches, the motorist can switch to low beam operation to avoid temporarily blinding the oncoming driver. Fog lamps are occasionally installed on vehicles to direct a lamp output downward in a direction closer to the vehicle to enable the motorist to more clearly see during rain and foggy conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Vehicle head lamps most typically contain two separate light bulbs that can be independently activated. When one of the bulbs is activated, a low beam lamp output is produced and when a second bulb of the two bulbs is activated a high beam lamp output is provided. In the 1980&apos;s when headlamps having halogen light bulbs were first built, the government enacted photometric tests. These tests dictated that light of a high enough intensity to cause spot blindness in other motorists did not reach certain regions in a space in front of a motor vehicle headlamp. Spot blindness was only a problem for halogen lights since these lights produce a much more intense output when compared with non-halogen lamps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,517,389 to Meyers concerns an electrochromic lamp assembly including a reflector having two or more reflective surfaces. A light source and an electrochromic means is positioned between the light source and at least one reflective surface. Each reflective surface directs light in a different direction. The electrochromic means is capable of blocking light from exiting the lamp assembly from at least one direction. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a lamp assembly for use with a motor vehicle. The lamp assembly includes regions on a light transmitting portion of an assembly housing that can be selectively controlled to change from opaque to highly transmissive. If used as a headlamp, the lamp assembly can operate as a fog lamp, can provide a low beam output lamp, can provide a high beam output lamp and can provide various combinations of these lamp operations. Other vehicle lamps such as a tail lamp can utilize features of the invention to control both the appearance and function of such lamps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One exemplary embodiment of a lamp assembly constructed in accordance with the invention includes a lamp bulb for emitting light from the lamp assembly that is supported by a bulb housing having a light transmissive portion for transmitting light from the lamp bulb to an illumination zone. At least a portion of the housing is coated with a coating material which covers a selected region of the light transmissive portion of the housing. By electrically energizing the coating material, its light transmissive properties are controlled, thereby controlling an amount of light transmitted from the bulb to the illumination zone. A drive circuit is electrically coupled to the coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When used as a headlamp, the exemplary embodiment of the invention gives a motorist direct control of intensity and zones of illumination. The motorist can adjust the illumination intensity and zone for specific traveling conditions, i.e. weather, terrain, time of day etc. This creates a safer environment to operate the motor vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Practice of the exemplary embodiment of the invention is achieved with one, high intensity bulb supported by a headlamp assembly having a reflective region for directing light through the light transmissive portion of the assembly. This structure can provide high beam, low beam and fog lamp outputs from a headlamp without resort to multiple bulbs and bulb housings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of the invention includes multiple regions that are defined by the coating material. These photometric patches eliminate a need for a bulb shield. Current commercially available bulb shields are made specifically for a high beam, low beam or fog lamp bulb housing. Alternatively, the bulb shield must be mechanically repositioned inside a bulb housing. Either of these two techniques is more complex and costly than a headlamp assembly built in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A preferred coating material is a PDLC material (polymer dispersed liquid crystal) which scatters light rather than absorbing the light to block its transmission. This characteristic greatly reduces heat build up associated with masking a halogen lamp, whose high intensity light output causes a rapid build up of heat in any material which absorbs that light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the bulb is extinguished, a current is applied to all regions of the PDLC material thereby causing those regions to be light transmissive for cosmetic purposes. An alternative option is to apply current to the PDLC material only when the bulb is illuminated. This would serve a cosmetic purpose so that a headlamp, tail lamp, fog light etc. could be rendered opaque when not illuminated and rendered light transmissive in a controlled manner across it surface when its associated lamp or bulb is on. As a still additional option, the PDLC regions can be rendered light transmitting when the motor vehicle engine is running regardless of the bulb condition so that a parked vehicle will have an opaque lamp assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention will become better understood from a detailed description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention which is described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT FOR PRACTICING THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that includes a headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for emitting light mounted to a bulb housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a light transmissive portion or lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for emitting light from the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an illumination zone in front of the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the light bulb housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reflects light reaching the surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> back into the housing interior so that it will exit the housing through the light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The light transmissive portion of the housing is coated at specified regions with a coating material. When these regions are electrically energized the coating material is rendered more light transmissive to alter the amount of light transmitted from the bulb to the illumination zone. A drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) electrically coupled to the regions of coating material energizes the coating material and thereby control a light output from the headlamp assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the invention the light transmissive portion of the housing is coated with three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the coating material. These bands are independently energized to adjust the light output from the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is for a motor vehicle. The opacity of the three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of coating material are selectively controlled to adjust the opacity of the three bands thereby producing a high beam output, a low beam output and a fog lamp output, respectively, from the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition to the three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the disclosed embodiment of the invention includes a plurality of smaller regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of coating material that are coupled to the drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by means of conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> routed across the light transmissive portion of the housing. Both the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and additional smaller regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are most preferably built using cut to size sheets of a polymer dispersed liquid crystal material, known as PDLC material. One example of a commercially available PDLC material is SPD film from Research Frontiers Incorporated, having a business address of 240 Crossways Park Drive, Woodbury, N.Y. 11797. This sheet of material can be cut to an appropriate shape and applied to the light transmissive portion of the bulb housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The coating material may be affixed to the inside of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a translucent adhesive to protect the material from weathering that would occur outside the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The coating material may also be applied to an outer surface of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using a protective laminate. Additionally the coating material may be a prefabricated panel, which is then clipped or locked into place when the headlamp assembly housing is constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are solely for photometric purposes and are not under direct control of the motorist. The patches are rendered opaque at any time that the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is outputting light to create a field of illumination which is in accordance with governmental photometric standards. The patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are made translucent or light transmitting by applying a current to the patches only when the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not producing light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the disclosed exemplary embodiment, the adhesive used to attach the PDLC material to the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is an electrically conductive adhesive. Use of the conductive adhesive avoids the use of metal on the sides of the patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and allows wiring to connect to the adhesive that is applied along the outer edges of the PDLC material. This use of adhesive enhances the cosmetics of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as well as eliminating the cost of edging the PDLC with copper or other conductive material. One suitable conductive adhesive is sold under the designation NOELLE 805-19 System, a two component (A&plus;B) high performance, silver filled, room temperature curing adhesive that is available from Noelle Industries, Adhesives, Coatings and Conductives, 83 Alexander Rd. Unit 3 Billerica Mass. 01821. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In an alternative mounting scheme, the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a multiple layer construction. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> a piece of PDLC material <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between inner and an outer layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of light transmitting plastic. In this alternate embodiment energizing leads or wires <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are routed to Indium Tin Oxide layers on inner and outer surfaces of the PDLC material through a narrow gap between the inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This multiplayer embodiment defines distinct regions of PDLC material but in a way wherein those regions are defined at the time the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fabricated rather than at a subsequent time by applying PDLC regions to the lens by means of an adhesive. In an alternate embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> a single lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> houses the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and individual segments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of coating material are constructed by sandwiching a suitably sized and shaped PDLC material <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> between inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of plastic. The resulting regions of coating material are then attached to the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using the conductive adhesive <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As a modification to this design, the regions of coating material can be attached to the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of mechanical attaching hardware such as for example by means of clips that hold an array of such segments together as well as clips that attach the array to an outer surface of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Drive Circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a user interface that includes a switch selector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for controlling inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to a programmable controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The programmable control includes a control program operating system that responds to the signals on the inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to produce on a set of controller outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. A driver circuit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is coupled to the coating material to apply a pulse width modulated signal to the coating material for altering the light transmissive characteristics of said coating material. In accordance with the disclosed exemplary embodiment of the invention, the highest light transmission occurs when the band is activated with a large alternating current square wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the disclosed embodiment of the invention, there are three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of coating material. Each band is independently controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one sees that the band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coupled to two conductors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the band <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is coupled to the two conductors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the band <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is coupled to the two conductors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The light transmitting status of the other smaller regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are controller by an output <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>so that the controller activates each of these regions to achieve approximately the same amount of light transmission. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each overlap with one or more of the additional small regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Current is applied to the PDLC patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not emitting light. This provides an appearance of a clear headlamp lens. At any time the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is producing light all the regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are deprived of current so as to be in an opaque state. This prevents light from the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from reaching photometric tests points located in front of the patches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The programmable controller is programmed so that when one of the bands is driven to a state wherein the material that makes up that band is highly light transmissive, its associated smaller regions of material are in a state of low transmission, i.e. they are highly opaque. Consider the topmost band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is covered in selected regions or zones by three additional smaller regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is activated by the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be highly light transmissive, the regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are not activated or energized, and consequently, are opaque. Since all patches are coupled to the same output from the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> controls all the patches, when the patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are opaque, the patches applied to overlap other bands of the lens are also opaque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has three contacts <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>so that <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or eight different control signal states can be generated as indicated in Table <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that follows.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is a requirement of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention that when the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is extinguished, a current is applied to all three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This renders the PDLC material of the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> light transmissive for cosmetic purposes. Automotive companies spend much money on headlamp design every year to create cosmetically attractive bulb shields and practice of the invention helps in achieving an attractive appearance. An alternative option is to apply current to the PDLC bands only when the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is illuminated. This would serve a cosmetic purpose so that a headlamp, taillamp, fog light could be rendered opaque when not illuminated and rendered light transmissive in a controlled manner across its surface when its associated lamp is on. As a still additional option, the PDLC regions can be rendered translucent when the motor vehicle is running regardless of the bulb condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> So long as the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is powered up by a signal derived from the twelve volt signal from the motor vehicle battery, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides pulsed on/off signals at the two outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. These signals have a frequency of about 64 hertz and have a duty cycle of 50%. These pulses pass through high current inverter drivers <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to a step up transformer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The step up transformer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> has a center tap <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> coupled to the twelve volt output from the vehicle battery. The transformer produces an alternating square wave signal across two bus conductors <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that alternates back and forth between &plus;40 volts and &minus;40 volts at a frequency of 64 hertz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the programmable controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also produces signals at outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>for controlling a light transmissive characteristic of the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and collectively the regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. These outputs from the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are 128 hertz, pulse width modulated, square waves. The width of the pulse determines the light intensity from the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> transmitted by an associated control element of coating material. Each of the outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is coupled to an associated optoisolator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>through an inverting, high current drive amplifier <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Consider the output <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When this output goes high, the inverter produces a low signal which turns on a light emitter of the optoisolator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This in turn turns on a transistor of the optoisolator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby transmitting the pulse to a bridge rectifier <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The bridge rectifier acts as a valve to transmit the 64 hertz signal across the bus conductors <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> across an associated control element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The pulse width of the <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> hertz signal at the outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>determines the light intensity of the light transmitting portions of the housing. The pulse width controls the on time of a bridge rectifier by switching the associate optocoupler on and off. This in turn determines a length of time that the 64 hertz signal from the transformer is applied to an associate PDLC coating member. A resistor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (10 k) and a capacitor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> (1 microfarad) determining the rate at which the voltage can rise across the PDLC. Given more time (wider pulse), the voltage will go higher and increase the light intensity transmitted through an associated control element such as one of the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Given less time (narrow pulse), the voltage will be lower and decrease the light intensity. The controller can control the pulse width in increments of 30 microseconds (0.000030 seconds) providing good resolution on light intensity control. In one exemplary embodiment, however, the coating material is either rendered essentially transparent due to application of the &plus;/&minus;40 volt signals from the transformer or is rendered opaque by blocking all signals from the transformer. The highly transparent state for the band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example, is achieved by application of a constant high output signal at the output <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>from the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In accordance with alternate procedures, a dimming of the light transmission is achieved through pulse width modulating an output from the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a controlled pulse width signal. Using the programming capability of the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> it is possible to control a level of opacity of each individual PDLC band in order to optimize the headlamp assembly performance. The operating system of the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be programmed with preset levels of opacity based upon the type of beam selected. For example, if may be that the optimum &ldquo;low beam with fog&rdquo; lamp combination emits a preferred amount of light by making the low beam PDLC band <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> 20% opaque. This value can be programmed or adjusted depending on the configuration of the lamp assembly and is generally an empirically determined factor. It may also be possible to use a master dimming switch that controls the opacity of the three PDLC bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Note, in this regard, the opacity of the patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constant so the dimming capacity noted above does not apply to these regions. An alternate method of energization uses a control over a Direct Current voltage level rather than a pulsing or alternating signal. In this embodiment the Direct Current applied to a PDLC region is varied to adjust the opacity of the PDLC region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The bulb housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is most preferably made from a front, light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that functions as a lens and an interior light reflecting surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A rear wall <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in relation to the front, light transmissive portion so that when the bulb is energized to emit light those portions of the light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> not blocked by sheets of opaque PDLC material transmit light to an illumination zone or region. Both the light transmissive and reflector sections <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> are molded plastic parts. During assembly, the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted to the reflector section <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and conductors for energizing the PDLC regions are attached to the reflector. The PDLC regions are attached to the light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the housing. In the disclosed embodiment of the invention, the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are supported on an inner surface of the light transmissive section <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The PDLC areas <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are attached to an outer surface of the light transmissive section <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The reflector section <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is most preferably coated with a paint that enhances a light reflecting capacity of an inner surface of the section <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The programmable controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> most preferably is a microprocessor that receives a DC energization signal from a voltage regulator circuit (not shown) powered by a motor vehicle battery. The microprocessor is programmed with an operating system that periodically senses the status of the input switches and provides appropriate pulse width modulated outputs from the outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>The use of a microprocessor adds flexibility to a manner in which the PDLC coated regions are activated. In certain instances such flexibility is not needed and a programmed logic array could be used to provide the input sensing and output signal control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, there is no benefit to separate programming of the PDLC patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for different activations of the three PDLC bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. However, the photometrics of a vehicle&apos;s headlamp depend upon the shape, height and overall dimensions of the car as well as the shape of the bulb housing&apos;s reflective surface which is dependent on each vehicle&apos;s front end design. Therefore, if some photometric points in front of the headlamp are necessary for a high beam but not a low beam, and if these points were affected by the low beam when it is operated without the high beam, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be programmed to only make the photometric point opaque in the high beam state by selective activation of the patches depending on the high beam/low beam status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Photometric standards pursuant to 49 C.F.R. sec 571.108(b) are tabulated below and indicate zones of coverage for the PDLC patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> depict alternate PDLC film coating patters for use with headlamps constructed in accordance with the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the front, forward facing light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing is coated with eight separate PDLC regions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> which cover an entire front surface of the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. These regions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> are independently energized to adjust the light output from the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, four regions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> cover the entire front light transmitting surface or lens with the exception of a &lsquo;hole&rsquo; or center region <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> made up of four center regions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. The hole <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is located at a region on the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at which the optics of the reflector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) concentrates the field of light to a &lsquo;hot spot&rsquo;. By placing the multiple regions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> over the hot spot and individually controlling their opacity, the shape and intensity of the light emitted through the hole <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> onto the road is controlled. Rendering the regions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> outside the hole <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> opaque eliminate any glare from side angles to oncoming motorists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the use of a multiple PDLC coating regions to create a grid <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> on the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This embodiment would give a greater degree of control of light being emitted from any region of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As an example, if there is a horizontal cut-off above or below which no light is to be emitted the segments of the grid above or below that cutoff could be controlled to remain opaque and thereby prevent light from being emitted through those regions. In either the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> embodiment of the invention, the programmable controller can be programmed to pulse a quadrant of the PDLC material on the bulb housing at a regular frequency so that it is rendered light opaque and then light transmissive with a fifty percent duty cycle. This pulsed operation simulates a turn signal and would eliminate the need for a turning signal separate from the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a third alternate array <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of multiple regions attached to a front surface of a lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This embodiment includes multiple bands of PDLC material that extend across the width of the headlamp. One particular band <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> includes multiple smaller segments or regions of PDLC material to give a greater degree of control over the light transmitting characteristics of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In certain bulb housing designs, the distance from the light source or bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a short enough distance so that the lens temperature reaches or exceeds the operating limits of the PDLC film adhering to the lens. To deal with this potential problem the distance between the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the PDLC regions can be extended by use of a cap <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) that fits over the front of the lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An array of one or more selectively light transmitting PDLC regions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are applied to an inner surface of a front light transmissive panel <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of such a cap <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this alternate embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) the PDLC film is spaced from an outer surface of the lens by an air gap <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> that adds separation between the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the PDLC materials supported by the cap <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. This added separation maintains the temperature of the PDLC materials within safe operational temperatures. Air circulation in the region of the PDLC materials is achieved by venting through a plurality of slots <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> along a side of the cap <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative use of the present invention. This figure depicts a tail lamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> schematically showing both a brake light <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and a backup light <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. A taillamp lens <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> faces outward away from a vehicle body. The lens supports an array <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of one or more PDLC regions attached at selected locations across an inner surface. Wires <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> for selectively controlling the light transmissive characteristics of the array of PDLC regions are routed along an outside surface of the tail lamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to a wiring harness <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> that activates the brake and backup lights. Although the disclosed tail lamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes brake and backup lights, a similar construction can be used with a tail lamp having only a single tail light and as mentioned previously such a lamp can include a control for simulating a turn signal rather than turning on and off the bulb. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENT FOR PRACTICING THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, reverse mode polymer dispersed liquid crystal is used as the coating material. Reverse mode PDLC material operates in a manner opposite to the PDLC material disclosed in the exemplary embodiment. When current is applied to the reverse mode PDLC material the material is rendered more opaque, on the other hand, when no current is applied, the material is rendered more light transmissive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As noted above, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that includes a headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for emitting light that is mounted to a bulb housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a light transmissive portion or lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for emitting light from the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an illumination zone in front of the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the light bulb housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reflects light reaching the surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> back into the housing interior so that it will exit the housing through the light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The light transmissive portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is coated at specified regions with a coating material. In the alternative embodiment, when these regions are electrically energized the coating material is rendered more opaque to block more light from passing through the coating material, whereas when the regions are not electrically energized, the coating material is more light transmissive. A drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is electrically coupled to the regions of coating material and thereby controls a light output from the headlamp assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Similar to the exemplary embodiment, in the alternative embodiment of the invention the light transmissive portion of the housing is coated with three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the coating material. These bands are independently energized to adjust the light output from the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is for a motor vehicle. The opacity of the three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of coating material are selectively controlled to adjust the opacity of the three bands thereby producing a high beam output, a low beam output and a fog lamp output, respectively, from the headlamp assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition to the three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the disclosed alternative embodiment of the invention includes a plurality of smaller regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of coating material that are coupled to the drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by means of conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> routed across the light transmissive portion of the housing. Both the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and additional smaller regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are most preferably built using cut to size sheets of a reverse mode polymer dispersed liquid crystal material. The coating material in the alternative embodiment may be affixed in a similar manner as disclosed in the exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are solely for photometric purposes and are not under the direct control of the motorist. The patches are rendered opaque at any time that the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is outputting light to create a field of illumination which is in accordance with governmental photometric standards. When the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not producing light, there is also no current being applied to the patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the patches are rendered light transmissive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the drive circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which includes a user interface that includes a switch selector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for controlling inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to a programmable controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The programmable control includes a control program operating system that responds to the signals on the inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to produce on a set of controller outputs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>A driver circuit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is coupled to the coating material to apply a pulse width modulated signal to the coating material for altering the light transmissive characteristics of the coating material. In accordance with the disclosed alternative embodiment of the invention, the highest light transmission occurs when the band is not activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there are three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of coating material. The controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> independently controls each band. Thus, by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one sees that the band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coupled to two conductors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the band <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is coupled to the two conductors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the band <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is coupled to the two conductors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The light transmitting status of the other smaller regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are controlled by an output <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>so that the controller regulates each of these regions to achieve approximately the same amount of light transmission. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each overlap with one or more of the additional small regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> No current is applied to the reverse mode PDLC patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not emitting light. This provides an appearance of a clear headlamp lens. At any time the headlamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is producing light, all the regions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are supplied current so as to render the regions more opaque. This prevents too high light levels from the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from reaching photometric tests points located in front of the patches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the alternative embodiment, the programmable controller is programmed so that when one of the bands is unactivated, making the material highly light transmissive, its associated smaller patch regions are activated to make them highly opaque. Consider the topmost band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is covered in selected regions or zones by three additional smaller regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, Sob, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the band <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is deprived of current by the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be highly light transmissive, the regions or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are activated or energized, and consequently, are opaque. Since all patches are coupled to the same output from the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> controls all the patches, when the patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are opaque, the patches applied to overlap other bands of the lens are also opaque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has three contacts <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>so that 2<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or eight different control signal states can be generated. As described below, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also may be programmed to adjust the light transmitted from the lamp assembly to respond to whether the engine is running or the headlamps are turned on by the motorist. These inputs are referred to as &lsquo;control inputs&rsquo; in the schematic depiction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the alternative embodiment, the controller is programmed in a manner to comport to the nature of the reverse mode PDLC material. Therefore, when one of the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is to be rendered highly light transmissive, the controller does not supply current to these areas. On the other hand, when one of the bands or patches is to be opaque, according to the status of the switch, the controller supplies current to this area. The same schematic depiction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, relating to the exemplary embodiment, applies to the disclosed alternative embodiment, however, the microprocessor outputs based on the control signals coming from the switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are determined based on the nature of the reverse mode PDLC material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The alternative embodiment also contemplates that when the bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is extinguished, current is not applied to all three bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This renders the reverse mode PDLC material of bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> light transmissive for cosmetic purposes. The reverse mode PDLC material allows the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be light transmissive when the motor vehicle is not running. Since no current is applied to the reverse mode PDLC material, use of this material eliminates the need for supplying current to the lamps when the motor vehicle is not running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the controller disclosed in the alternative embodiment operates in the same manner as the controller disclosed in the exemplary embodiment. The use of the reverse mode PDLC material in the alternative embodiment requires current to render the bands <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and patches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> opaque and no current to render these areas light transmissive. The microprocessor operating system determines whether or not current is applied based on inputs from the switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> while all other aspects relating to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> remain the same. A reverse mode PDLC material that is clear in the undriven state and is opaque when energized is commercially available from Merck Liquid Crystals under the trade designation Licrilite. (Registered Tradmark) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While the exemplary and alternative embodiments of the invention have been described with a degree of particularity, it is the intent that the invention include all modifications and alterations from the disclosed design falling within the spirit or scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
