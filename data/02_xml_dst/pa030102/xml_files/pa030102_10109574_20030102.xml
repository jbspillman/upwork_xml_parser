<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Every year, plant pathogens cause billions of dollars worth of damage across the globe. Amongst the most destructive classes of plant pathogens are bacteria that grow within the xylem vessels of the host plants. As opposed to fungal pathogens, effective bactericides are not available for protecting plants against bacterial pathogens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most of the available compounds are antibiotics (like streptomycin and tetracycline) that are either not effective under field conditions or also affect the host plant. Moreover there is the concern that the use of these antibiotics will result in the spread of antibiotic resistance determinants amongst pathogens that cause disease in humans and other animals. For e.g., tetracycline is one of the drugs of choice for use against <highlight><italic>Yersinia pestis </italic></highlight>(the plague bacterium). The use of tetracycline against plant pathogens might result in exposure of <highlight><italic>Yersinia pestis </italic></highlight>to this antibiotic as this bacterium is harbored by rats that populate agricultural fields. There is thus a need for the identification of a new set of targets to develop novel bactericides against plant pathogenic bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>(Xoo) is a bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial leaf blight (BLB), a very serious disease of rice. Neither effective bactericides nor resistant rice cultivars are available to reduce yield losses due to this pathogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>causes bacterial leaf blight, a serious disease of rice. Worldwide at least 350 different plant diseases are known to be caused by various xanthomonads (17). A characteristic feature of the genus Xanthomonas is the production of yellow, membrane-bound pigments called xanthomonadins (28). The xanthomonadins are initially thought to be carotenoids, but later they are characterized as a unique group of halogenated aryl polyene pigments (2, 3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The functional role of xanthomonadins is poorly understood. The vast majority of pigment-deficient mutants that have been isolated from several xanthomonads are prototrophs (20, 29) and virulence proficient upon wound inoculation (9, 20, and 29). Pigment-deficient mutants of <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas juglandis </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>have been reported to be more sensitive to photobiological damage than the wold-type strains are (13, 22), suggesting that the pigment may provide protection against photo-damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An 18.6-kb region containing seven transcriptional units required for xanthomonadin biosynthesis has been isolated from <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas campestris </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Campestris </italic></highlight>(20, 21). One of the transcriptional units, pigB, encodes a diffusible factor that is involved in both pigment and extracellular polysaccharide production (21). The pigB mutants have also been shown to be impaired for epipyhytic survival and host infection (22). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In further embodiment of the present invention, wherein developing aroe gene mutant bacterial plant pathogen <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>named BXO65, with mutation in shikimate dehydrogenase and thereby loss of virulence on rice crops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, applicants have determined that Xoo mutants that are defective in the production of the shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme are unable to cause disease on rice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, Shikimate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway and the virulence deficiency appears to be due to the limited availability of aromatic amino acids within the xylem vessels of the rice plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, shikimate dehydrogenase can be used as a target to develop novel bactericides against Xoo, and possibly against other bacterial pathogens. These bactericides can be in the nature of compounds that affect the shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme of the pathogen without affecting the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the shikimate pathway is a good target for these purposes as it is absent in humans and most animals. Therefore, compounds that target shikimate dehydrogenase may have minimal toxic affects with regard to exposure of humans and other animals to these compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the judicious application of such compounds could help control yield losses due to Xoo as well as other bacterial pathogens that dwell in the xylem vessels of host plants. Since the shikimate pathway is absent in humans, an additional possibility is that inhibitors of shikimate dehydrogenase may also be used against bacterial pathogens of humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Xanthomonadins are yellow, membrane-bound pigments produced by members of the genus Xanthomonas. Applicants identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>mutant (BX065) that is deficient for xanthomonadin production and virulence on rice, as well as auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids (Pig<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Vir<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Aro<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>). Reversion analysis indicated that these multiple phenotypes are due to single mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a genomic library of the wild-type strain is used to isolate a 7.0-kb clone that complements BX065. By transposon mutagenesis, marker exchange, sequence analysis, and subcloniong, the complementing activity is localized to a 849-bp open reading frame (ORF). This ORF is homologous to the aroE gene, which encodes shikimate dehydrogenase in various bacterial species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Shikimate dehydrogenase activity is present in the wild-type strain and the mutant with the complementing clone, whereas no activity is found in BX065. This clone also complemented an <highlight><italic>Escherichia Coli </italic></highlight>aroE mutant for porototrophy, indicating that aroE is functionally conserved in <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv, <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>E. Coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the nucleotide sequence of the 2.9-kb region containing aroE revealed that a putative DNA helicase gene is located adjacent to aroE. Applicants results indicate that aroE is required for normal levels of virulence and xanthomonadin production in <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae.</italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, an absorption spectrum of the pigment extracted from the BX043 strain showed a characteristic structure with peak at 445 nm and shoulders at 425 and 470 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). These features are missing from the absorption spectrum of the BX065 strain. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence characteristics of these strains were assayed with rice leaves as described in Materials and Methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Lengths of lesions caused by BXO43 and BXO65 are measured 10 and 15 days after inoculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, it is apparent that BXO65 is severely virulence deficient (Vir&minus;). Prototrophic revertants of BXO65 are isolated and are found to have regained pigment and virulence proficiency (data not shown). Simultaneous reversion suggests that a single mutation is responsible for the pleiotropic phenotype of BXO65. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, forty-day-old greenhouse-grown rice plants of susceptible rice cultivar Taichung Native-1 are inoculated by clipping leaf tips with sterile scissors dipped in saturated cultures (10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml) of <highlight><italic>X.oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, when this method is used, approximately 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cells are deposited at the site of inoculation. The plants are incubated in a greenhouse with minimum and maximum temperatures of approximately 25 and 30&deg; C., respectively, and a relative humidity of approximately 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, lesion lengths are measured at regular intervals. No lesions are observed in control experiments in which the leaves are inoculated with scissors dipped in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the procedure described previous for extraction of xanthomonadin from <highlight><italic>X. juglandis </italic></highlight>is used, with some modifications, <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>cultures are grown to the stationary phase and xanthomonadin is extracted in chloroform-methanol (2:1) by shaking for 3 h at room temperature. The amount of pigment produced per 100 mg. (dry weight) of bacterial cells is expressed as the absorbance (optical density at 445 nm) of the crude pigment extracts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, applicants also quantified the pigment by assuming that the structure and molar extinction coefficient of xanthomonadin from <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>are identical to those of a xanthomonadin from <highlight><italic>X. juglandis. </italic></highlight>Similar conclusions could be drawn by using either method for pigment estimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a partial EcoRI-digested genomic library of applicant&apos;s laboratory wild-type <highlight><italic>X.oryze </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryze </italic></highlight>strain, having an average insert size of 30 kb, is prepared in the broad-host range Km<highlight><superscript>r </superscript></highlight>cosmid cloning vector pUFR034. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a total of 960 clones from this library are transferred from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DH5&agr; to S17-1 by using pRK600 as a helper. Genomic clones from the library in S17-1 are mobilized in pools of 12 clones each into the pigment-deficient mutant by performing biparental mating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, transconjugants that appeared on PSA-rifampin-kanamycin selection plates are replica plated onto minimal medium plates containing kanamycin to identify prototrophic and pigment-proficient colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, clones from a cosmid genomic library of BXO1 are mobilized into BX065 in 55 pools containing 12 clones each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, we identified three donor pools which yielded Aro<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Pig<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exconjugants. Individual clones from the three pools are mobilized into BX065, which led to identification of three independent complementing clones, pAG1, pAG2, and pAG3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the EcoRI restriction patterns of the three plasmids revealed that there are three common Eco RI fragments (7.0, 4.0, and 1.5 kb). When the 7.0-kb fragment is subcloned (pAG4) and mobilized into BX065, it is found to contain the complementing activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the absorption spectrum of the pigment extracted from BX01704 (BX065/pAG4) is identical to that of BX043 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and the amount of pigment produced is estimated to be 30% more than the amount produced in the wild type (Table 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, this could have been due to the presence of the aroE gene on a multicopy plasmid in BXO1704. The pAG4 plasmid also complemented BX065 partially (&tilde;60%) for virulence on rice (FIG. 2). This partial complementation could have been a result of instability of the clone because of the absence of antibiotic selection inside the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, transposon 3 insertions are obtained with the pAG4 clone by using Tn3-HoHo1, with some modifications. Plasmids are isolated, and the insertions are localized on either the insert or the vector DNA by restriction analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the 7.0-kb EcoRI fragment in pAG4 is also cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript(KS) to obtain pAG4 and is mutagenized by mini-transposon 7 (mTn7) derivatives by using an in vitro transposition kit (Genome Priming System; New England Biolabs &lsqb;NEB&rsqb;, Beverly, Mass.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the mTn7 element encodes kanamycin resistance. Two different mTn7 insertions on the cloned DNA in plasmids pAG9 and pAG10 (Table 1) are found to be in the aroE gene (see below). These two insertions are cloned into the shuttle vector pHM1(Sp<highlight><superscript>r</superscript></highlight>) (Table 1) by usisng EcoRI restriction sites (EcoRI does not cut within the mTn7 element) to obtain plasmids pAG11 and pAG12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Plasmids pAG11 and pAG12 and the derivatives of Pag containing Tn3-HoHo1 insertions are mobilized individually into BX0-43 for marker exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, marker exchange is done by growing the cells in either PS-ampicillin medium (for Tn3-HoHo1) or PS-kanamycin medium for (for mTn7) for more than 30 generations by serial passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, colonies that are either Ap<highlight><superscript>r </superscript></highlight>Km<highlight><superscript>s </superscript></highlight>(for Tn3-HoHo1) or Km<highlight><superscript>r </superscript></highlight>Sp<highlight><superscript>s </superscript></highlight>(for mTn7) are analyzed by Southern hybridization to confirm that marker exchange had occurred as expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the 7.0-kb Eco RI fragment in the pAG4 clone is subjected to mutagenesis by using Tn3-HoHo1 and mTn7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, seven independent Tn3-HoHo1 insertions are obtained on pAG4, and one of them, aroE1::Tn3-HoHo1, affected the ability to complement BX065 (data not shown). This insertion is marker exchanged in the BX043 background. The marker exchange mutant BXO1706 is found to be Pig<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), Vir<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>(data not shown), and auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, introductions of pAG4 into BXO1706 restored the Pig<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Vir<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Aro<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> phenotype (data not shown). This indicated that aroE1::Tn3-HoHo1 disrupted a transcriptional unit that is required for pigmentation, virulence, and prototrophy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Marker exchange mutants obtained with six other Tn3-HoHo1 insertions are Pig<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Vir<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Aro<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Twenty-nine mTn7 insertions are obtained for the 7.0-kb DNA cloned in pAG5 (see Materials and Methods). Two of these insertions, aroE2::mTn7 AND aroE3::mTn7 in plasmids pAG9 and pAG10, respectively, are found to be in the aroE open reading frame (ORF). These two insertions along with flanking 7.0-kb sequences are cloned in the EcoRI site of the plasmid shuttle vector pHM1 to give plasmids pAGI 1 and pAG12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, both pAG11 and pAG12 failed to complement BX065, indicating that aroE2::mTn7 and aroE3::mTn7 abolished the complementing ability of the 7.0 kb genomic fragment. When the aroE2::mTn7 insertion is marker exchanged in the BX043 background, it produced the Pig<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> Vir<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> Aro<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> mutant strain BXO1707 (data not shown). The aroE3::mTn7 insertion could not be marker exchanged, most likely because of limited homology on one side of the insertion (FIG. 3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, plasmid DNA is isolated by the alkaline lysis method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Restriction digestions are performed by using enzymes obtained from NEB as recommended by the supplier. Primers that are outwardly directed from Tn3-HoHo1 are used to obtain the sequence of DNA flanking the Tn3-HoHo1 insertions. mTn7-specific primers provided in the Genome Priming System kit from NEB are used to sequence the mTn7 insertion sites. M13 forward and reverse primers are used to sequence to ends of a 7.0-kb insert in clone pAG5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the sequencing reactions, electrophoresis, and sequence data analyses are performed with an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a homology search in the database is performed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information by using the BLAST algorithm (1). Promoter prediction is performed by using software at the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher (www.hisc.bcm.tmc.edu). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the sequence of a 2.953-kb region containing aroE is determined. This sequence has been submitted to GenBank with accession no. AF258797. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a 2.953-kb region cloned in pAG5 is sequenced by using transposon-specific primers, as well as primer walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the insertions aroE1::Tn3-HoHo1, aroE2::mTn7, and aroE3::mTn7 are found to be present in a 849-bp ORF with the potential to encode a 283-amino-acid protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, a homology search using the BLAST algorithm revealed that the ORF is homologous to aroE, which encodes shikimate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway of various bacterial species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, maximum homologies are found with aroE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ database accession no.

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, promoter prediction, as described in Materials and Methods, indicated the presence of &minus;35 and &minus;10 promoter regions 100 and 75 nucleotides upstream of the putative ATG start codon, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, within the ORF the aroE1::mTn3-HoHo1, aroE2::mTn7, and aroE3::mTn7 insertions are located at the 634<highlight><superscript>th</superscript></highlight>, 350<highlight><superscript>th</superscript></highlight>, and 15<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>nucleotides, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A PstI restriction site is identified 200 bp downstream of the aroE stop condon. This site is used to clone a 1.2-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment that included the aroE ORF to obtain plasmid pAG7. When pAG7 is introduced into BX065, this minimal fragment is sufficient to confer the Pig<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Vir<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Aro<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> phenotype (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, in the 2.953-kb sequence, another ORF downstream of aroE is identified by using the BLAST algorithm. This incomplete ORF started at 1,546<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>nucleotide and showed very strong homology in the 1,407 bp sequenced (55% similarity and 36% identity at the amino acid level) to dinG (DNA damage-inducible gene G), which enclodes an ATP-dependent helicase in <highlight><italic>E.coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>aroE mutant strain AB2835 (30) is transformed individually with pAG4 and pAG5 and with plasmids pAG8, pAG9, and pAG10 having transposon insertions in the aeroE ORF (Table 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Plasmids pAG4 and pAG5 complemented AB2835 for growth on minimal medium, whereas the other plasmids having an insertion in the aroE ORF are not able to do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, all strains grew on minimal medium supplemented with the three aromatic amino acids and the aromatic vitamins p-aminobenzoic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Plasmid curing from strain AB2835/pAG4 resulted in a loss of prototrophy (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, cell lysates are prepared as described by Chaudhuri and Coggins, and protein contents are estimated by the Bradford method (5). Shikimate dehydrogenase activities in cell lysates of <highlight><italic>X.oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>strains are assayed as described previously for <highlight><italic>E.coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, Shikimic acid and NDAP are used as substrates, and reduction of NADP to NADPH is assayed by monitoring increase in absorbance at 340 nm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 &mgr;mol of NADPH produced per min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, protein extracts are prepared from the wild-type and aroE mutant strains of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae, </italic></highlight>and shikimate dehydrogenase activity is measured (see Materials and Methods). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the Michaelis constant of this enzyme for shikimic acid is calculated to be 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>M, a value very similar to that <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(32). The enzyme activity is found to be 5.4 mU/mg of protein in wild-type strain BX043 (Table 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, no activity is detected in aroE mutant-strain BX065 or in BX01706(aroE1::Tn3-HoHo1) or BXO1707 (aroE2::mTn7). The BXO1704 strain (BX065/pAG4) had an activity of 65 mU/mg of protein, approximately 12 times that of BX043 (Table 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, cross-feeding of BX065 with 15 independently isolated EMS-induced prototrophic pigment-deficient mutants is tested by streaking the mutant strains adjacent to BX065 in pairwise combinations on PSA plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, development of a yellow color in BXO65 at the adjacent colony boundary is considered to indicate cross-feeding for pigmentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, BXO65 could not be cross-fed for pigmentation by wild-type strain BX043, whereas 8 of 15 EMS-induced prototrophic pigment-deficient mutants could do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, none of the 15 prototrophic pigment-deficient mutants could be cross-fed by each other BX043, or BX065 for pigmentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, mutations in the aroE gene of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>result in reduced levels of xanthomonadin production and virulence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a mutation affecting a specific step in a general metabolic pathway that also affects xanthomonadin biosynthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, insertional inactivation of any of the seven transcriptional units previously shown to be required for xanthomonadin biosynthesis in <highlight><italic>x.campestris </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Campestris </italic></highlight>has not been reported to cause any nutrient deficiences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, also, clones containing the aroE gene of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>do not show any homology with the pig gene cluster of either <highlight><italic>X.campestris </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Campestris </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>X.oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae. </italic></highlight>This indicates that the aroE gene is from a different genomic locus than the gene cluster that was previously shown to be required for xanthomonadin biosynthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, shikimate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of dehydroshikimate to shikimic acid. How might shikimate production be related to xanthomonadin biosynthesis&quest; One possibility, as previously suggested, is that the aromatic ring in xanthomonadin may be derived from the shikimate pathway. This would be interesting because the aromatic ring in aromatic carotenold pigments is derived from cyclization of the polyene chain and not from the shikimate pathway. However, we have observed that shikimic acid facilitates neither growth on minimal medium nor pigmentation in aroE mutants (Goel and sonti, unpublished results). This might be because aroE mutants of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>Oryzae </italic></highlight>are deficient in shikimic acid uptake, as reported previously for <highlight><italic>E. coil </italic></highlight>aroE mutants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the residual amount of pigment made in the aroE mutants may be derived either from a very small amount of shikimic acid produced by spontaneous conversion of dehydroshikimate to shikimic acid or through a second minor pathway. It is also possible that the pigment produced by the aroE mutants is devoid of the aromatic ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, detailed structural analysis and biochemical experiments, such as feeding wild-type cells with labelled shikimic acid and monitoring the incorporation of the label, are required to address these issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, several EMS-induced pigment-deficient mutants are able to cross-feed aroE mutant strains for pigment production. This suggests that a diffusible compound that can enter the pigment biosynthetic pathway accumulates in these stains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, as xanthomonadins are membrane-bound pigments, the compound or intermediate must act prior to commitment to the membrane-bound state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the inability of the wild-type strain and some of the EMS-induced mutants to cross-feed aroE strains suggests that the compound does not accumulate in these strains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the inability of the prototrophic EMS-induced pigment-deficient mutants to cross-feed each other suggests that they are defective in reactions that involve commitment to either the membrane-bound state or subsequent steps in xanthomonadin production and transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the virulence deficiency of the aeroE mutants is most likely due to a growth defect. The in planta doubling times for the wild type, aroE mutant BXO65, and a mutant with a complementing clone are 8.6, 25.7, and 10.5 h, respectively (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, this is the first report which suggests that one or more aromatic amino acids may be limiting for growth of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>in rice plants. A virulence deficiency has previously been reported to be associated with either arginine or leucine auxotrophy in <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, the results also suggest that shikimate dehydrogenase can be used as a target to develop novel bactericides against <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae. </italic></highlight>These bactericides can be compounds that affect the shikimate dehydrogenase of the pathogen without affecting the host. The shikimate pathway may be a good target for this purpose as it is absent in mammals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, it is pertinent to note that effective bactericides are not available for use against <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>and that judicious application of such compounds could help control yield losses due to this devastating rice pathogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The details of the present invention are illustrated below with the help of examples but should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Overexpression and Purification of Shikimate Dehydrogenase Enzyme of <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The plasmids pAG7 containing aroE and the pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech, Upsaala, Sweden) are purified from cultures of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>by the alkaline lysis method (25). PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) primers for the aroE gene are designed, by methods familiar to those well versed in the art, to incorporate the sites for BamHl and EcoRL. PCR is performed with Vent Polymerase (NEB) using pAG7 DNA as template to obtain a single fragment of approximately 870 bp. This fragment is digested with restriction enzymes BamH1 and EcoRI obtained from NEB. This fragment is cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2T using standard procedures as described (25) to generate a fusion of the shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE) alongwith the gene for glutathione-S-transferase that is encoded on pGEX2. Exponentially growing <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cultures containing this recombinant aroE plasmid are induced with IPTG (Isopropyl thio galactoside; a potent inducer of the promoter to which aroE gene is fused) to produce large amounts of the shikimate dehydrogenase fusion protein. The uninduced plasmid does not produce the fusion protein. The cells are lysed and the overexpressed shikimate dehydrogenase-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein is purified using glutathione agarose beads as per manufacturer&apos;s (Pharmacia) instructions. Shikimate dehydrogenase protein is obtained by cleaving the fusion protein with thrombin as per manufacturer&apos;s (Pharmacia) instructions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The purified shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme can be used in enzyme assays (32) to identify chemicals that are inhibitory to the activity of the enzyme. The assay involves use of Shikimic acid and NADP as substrates. The reduction of NADP to NADPH is followed by monitoring increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The inhibitors would be chemicals that would prevent/reduce enzyme mediated conversion of NADP to NADPH as monitored by following absorbance at 340 nm. The total reaction volume would be 100&mgr; liters, sufficient to be accommodated in the 250&mgr; liter wells of ELISA plates. The absorbance can be followed on an ELISA spectrophotometer. The reaction is rapid and proceeds to saturation in thirty seconds to one mimjte. This facilitates the screening of a large number of candidate inhibitor molecules. The procedure can be automated, wherein liquid handling systems can be used for pipetting various reaction ingredients including enzyme, substrates, buffer, inhibitors, etc. The procedure for spectrophotometric analysis can also be automated, facilitating the screening of a large number of chemical libraries. These procedures for automation are routinely used in drug discovery programmes all over the world and can be adapted to screen for shikimate dehydrogenase inhibitors using the above assay with the purified enzyme. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Development of a Screening Procedure for Identifying Inhibitors of Shikimate Dehydrogenase Enzyme of <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>Pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>Using the Cloned <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>Pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>aroE Gene (PAGS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The principle of this method is that a strain carrying shikimate dehydrogenase gene on a high copy number plasmid (pAG5; pBluescript is the vector) will produce higher amounts of shikimate dehydrogenase and can therefore tolerate higher concentrations of shikimate dehydrogenase irihibitor. The host strain would be an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>wild type strain containing either pAG5 (table 1) or the pBluescript vector without added insert. The use of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is doubly advantageous because it grows faster than <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>and the high copy number plasmid (copy number of 500-1000/cell) can replicate in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and not in <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae. </italic></highlight>Results presented demonstrate that the <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pv. <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>gene is expressed and will functionally complement an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>aroE mutant. The criteria for a shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitor would be retardation of growth on minimal medium of an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain that carries the high copy number plasmid (without aroE gene) with either little or no effect on a strain that has the aroE gene on a high copy plasmid. The growth assays can be performed in 96 well ELISA plates and growth can be followed by change in absorbance at 600 nm in ELISA spectrophotometer. Again, this is a procedure that can be automated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The inhibitors of shikimate dehydrogenase identified by assays conducted as described in Examples 2 and 3 are screened for their ability to inhibit growth of <highlight><italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>onjninimal mediumprepared as described (15). Saturated cultures of the wild type <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>grown in minimal medium are diluted ten fold in double distilled water and plated onto minimal medium agar plates containing different concentrations of the inhibitor in the presence or absence of aromatic amino acids. An inhibitor of shikimate dehydrogenase should prevent growth of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>only on minimal medium that is not supplemented with aromatic amino acids. This inhibitor should also inhibit xanthomonadin production which can be assayed as lack (or reduced amounts) of the characteristic yellow pigmentation. The assay for reduction in xanthomonadin production is performed on Peptone Sucrose Agar (29) medium. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Forty to fifty day old green house grown rice plants of cultivars Taichung Native-1 and BPT5204 (a fine quality rice from South India) are sprayed with solutions of different concentrations of the inhibitor and compared with those that are sprayed only with the solvent (water). The plants are subjected to a second round of spraying, 36 hours after the initial spaying. The plants are examined at regular intervals, prior to and after the second round of spraying, for symptoms of chlorosis (loss of green coloration), stunting (growth inhibition) and at later stages for defects in the emergence of panicle (rice inflorescence). <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>is also a seed borne pathogen and therefore bactericides would also be used to used to rid the seeds of infestation by this pathogen. Therefore any potential bactericide would have to be examined to determine if it has adverse effects on seed germination. For this purpose, rice seeds would be germinated in growth chambers or incubators, at 28&deg; Centigrade, on moistened filter paper containing different concentrations of the inhibitor. Germination is assayed after 72-96 hours as emergence of radicals (roots) and shoots. Shikimate dehydrogenase assays can also be performed as described hi Example 2, on crude protein extracts of rice leaves, in order to determine if any of the tested compounds will affect rice shikimate dehydrogenase activity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Forty to fifty day old green house grown rice plants of cultivars Taichung Native-1 and BPT5204 (a fine quality rice from South India) are inoculated with saturated cultures of <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>by either clipping (14) or dipping leaves in bacterial culture. In the latter method of infection, which is more akin to natural conditions, the bacterium must enter the plant through natural openings called hydathodes. Twelve hours after inoculation an optimum concentration of the inhibitor (identified in Examples 4 and 5) that would not inhibit growth of rice but would inhibit <highlight><italic>X. oryzae </italic></highlight>pathovar <highlight><italic>oryzae </italic></highlight>is sprayed over these plants. Control plants would also be sprayed with water alone (no inhibitor). Small amounts of a surfactant such as Tween 20 will also be added to test solutions as well as the control in order to facilitate absorption by the leaf. This procedure is repeated 36 hours later. Afer an additional week on the greenhouse bench, the leaves are examined for bacterial leaf blight symptoms. The efficiency of infection (number of leaves exhibiting symptoms of bacterial leaf blight/total number of infected leaves) as well as the length of the lesions are estimated. An effective inhibitor would be one that reduces efficiency of infection as well as lesion length. </paragraph>
