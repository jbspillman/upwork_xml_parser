<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a structure of a magnetic bearing that supports a rotor without making contact, particularly a stator core for a homo-polar type of magnetic bearing, and a method of manufacturing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A turbo compressor can be made larger in capacity and smaller in size than a reciprocating or screw compressor, and can be easily made to an oil-free type. Therefore, turbo compressors are used often as general-purpose compressors in applications such as a compressed air source for factories, a source of air for separation, and other various processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, gas bearings, sliding bearings and magnetic bearings have been used to support a high-speed rotating shaft of a high-speed motor that is connected directly to and drives a turbo compressor. In particular, a homo-polar magnetic bearing can be used to support a rotor (rotating shaft) in a contact free manner that rotates to form the high speed shaft of a high speed motor by passing magnetic flux through the shaft to produce an electromagnetic sucking force which causes the shaft to float, this being one type of radial magnetic bearing for use with shafts that rotate at a high speed (for instance, 100,000 min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> show typical schematic viewes of a conventional homo-polar magnetic bearing. In these figures, a homo-polar magnetic bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of a rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is arranged at the axial center of a casing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and parallel to it in the axial direction and can rotate at a high speed, U-shaped stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> installed inside the casing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with gaps between the outer surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and coils <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that are placed around the toothed ends of the stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, a plurality of stator cores (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> cores in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>) are disposed equally spaced in the circumferential direction with gaps between the outer surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Although not illustrated, stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are arranged in the axial direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in at least 2 locations with a predetermined distance between them. Consequently, the rotor can rotate stably at a high speed. A stator core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is made of laminated steel sheets each of which is manufactured with an insulating adhesive material applied to its surface to bond to an adjacent thin steel sheet, and these are bonded one after another to obtain a predetermined length. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the direction A in which the laminated steel sheets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (lamination) are bonded is arranged to be perpendicular to the axial direction Z of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the homo-polar magnetic bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since the toothed ends of the stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that surround the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are close to each other in the axial direction and as the coils <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> produce the N and S poles of an electro magnet, the homo-polar magnetic bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can float the shaft in a contact free manner and support the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the sucking force of the toothed ends located opposite each other. Therefore, the direction of this homo-polar magnetic field is parallel to the centerline of the rotor and on the outer surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown by the dashed arrow lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> is a schematic view that shows a conventional process for assembling laminated steel sheets to form a conventional stator core. Normally, the stator core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the homo-polar magnetic bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured by making thin rectangular steel sheets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coated with an insulating material, by a method such as punching, and assembling these punched steel sheets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>one after another, to produce a laminated stator core <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, when the inner surfaces of the aforementioned stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (laminated steel sheets) are cut by a rotary cutting process, a large cutting load is applied to the edges of the laminated steel sheets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a lateral direction, so the tips of the laminated steel sheets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are bent, and the insulating material is crushed in the direction of rotation by the above-mentioned bending load, which is a practical problem. Consequently, the steel sheets contact each other resulting in an increase in the eddy currents in the stator unit, so another problem occurs due to the reduced levitation force applied to the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, poor rotating characteristics, etc. Still another problem is that the laminated material is peeled away by the edge of the cutting tool. Even if the above-mentioned process of cutting in a lathe is replaced by using a vertical boring machine etc. to cut the inner surfaces of laminated steel sheets, because there are gaps between adjacent steel sheets, there is the additional problems that smooth cutting and true roundness cannot be easily ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the inventors of the present invention have proposed the homo-polar magnetic bearing apparatus configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, with the aim of improving the characteristics of conventional homo-polar magnetic bearings (unpublished Japanese patent application No. 88402/2000). According to this magnetic bearing apparatus, adjacent N poles or S poles are connected together in the circumferential direction, or are located close to each other with a small gap between them. The homo-polar magnetic bearing with this configuration has the advantage that it is capable of greatly reducing the production of eddy currents and the heat and eddy current losses generated in the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, if the stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the homo-polar magnetic bearing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are produced using laminated steel sheets with small eddy current losses, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the laminated steel sheets become so thin in the peripheral web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that they fail, crush or peel when processed, which is a practical disadvantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More explicitly, in the homo-polar magnetic bearing with the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected together circumferentially or located close to each other, so the distribution of magnetic flux in the rotor is more uniform and losses can be reduced. Conversely, however, if stator cores <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in which the tips are connected together are formed with a conventional laminated structure, the laminated steel sheets are so small in the portions where adjacent magnetic poles are connected together that the laminated structure may collapse when the cores are machined, therefore, it is very difficult to machine the cores without detaching, crushing or peeling the laminations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another problem in a conventional apparatus is that amorphous materials cannot be used because they are difficult to laminate, despite the advantages of having a high electrical resistance and permeability, so the choice of electromagnetic sheet steel is restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Next, the structure of a conventional homo-polar radial magnetic bearing is described in more detail than before by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a front view of a conventional homo-polar radial magnetic bearing, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is the corresponding side sectional elevation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an isometric view of the stator core of a conventional homo-polar radial magnetic bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The homo-polar radial magnetic bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a casing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a plurality of electromagnetic components <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The rotating shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made of a material which is magnetic at least on the surface thereof, with an outer diameter of D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a length determined by the rotor. The rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed coaxially with the centerline of the casing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, parallel thereto in the longitudinal direction, and is supported so that it can rotate freely. The plurality of electromagnetic components <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> support the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that it can rotate freely, and are arranged around the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For instance, four electromagnetic components are connected together to form a set, and sets of electromagnetic components <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> support the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at 2 locations. At each supporting location, 4 electromagnetic components are equally spaced around the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The electromagnetic components <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are provided with stator cores <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and coils <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is provided with two yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a stem portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A yoke <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a column-shaped portion one end of which is opposite the outer surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a gap between them that induces a magnetic pole on the surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The two yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are arranged axially with a predetermined spacing between each other. The stem portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a magnetic structure between the other ends of the two yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> connecting the yokes together. The stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a thick U-shaped unit comprised of the two yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the stem portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> without gaps, and is installed in a recess on the inner periphery of the casing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The coil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a bundle of wire. The wire is wound in several layers around the yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with an air gap between the coil and yoke. The coil <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a block with the same shape as the section of the yoke <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with an air gap between the coil and yoke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The structure of the stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is described in further detail referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made of laminated steel sheets, consisting of a plurality of magnetic steel sheets <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and an insulating material. The magnetic steel sheet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a thin steel sheet with a thickness T, shaped in the aforementioned U shape. The insulating material is a non-conducting material and is applied between the plurality of magnetic steel sheets <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. When the stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is assembled as an electromagnetic component, it is laminated in the circumferential direction of the rotor. The magnetic steel sheet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the illustrated stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is rectangular in shape with a width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, provided with a slot W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wide and H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in height, on the side forming the magnetic pole surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made of a plurality of laminated magnetic steel sheets <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> with a predetermined length of L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another type of electromagnetic component, the width of a stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> near the magnetic pole surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is extended circumferentially in the direction of the outer surface of the rotor, and comes in close contact with the magnetic pole surfaces of the adjacent electromagnetic components of the stator core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still another type of electromagnetic component, the width of a stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> near the magnetic pole surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is extended circumferentially in the direction of the outer surface of the rotor, and is integrated with the magnetic pole surface of an adjacent electromagnetic component of the stator core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the aforementioned stator core for a magnetic bearing is manufactured, thin sheet steel with a thickness T is punched using dies, to produce U-shaped magnetic steel sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Next, the magnetic pole surface <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the stator core for a magnetic bearing must be machined into a circular arc using a lathe etc.; at this time, the rotation causes a cutting load that acts laterally on the edges of the laminated steel sheets, so the tips of the electromagnetic steel sheets are bent; due to this bending, the insulation material is crushed in the direction of rotation, often resulting in adjacent electromagnetic steel sheets coming in contact with each other. The problem encountered when this happens is that large eddy currents are produced in the electromagnetic steel sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another problem that the laminated steel sheets become separated during cutting, may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> There is also another problem that if a vertical boring machine is used instead of a lathe, differences are produced at the edges between adjacent laminated steel sheets, and a true, smooth circle cannot be ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With the type of stator core for a magnetic bearing in which the magnetic pole surface of the stator core is extended over the outer surface of the rotor, since the laminated steel sheets in the extended portions become very thin, they may cause problems by becoming detached, crushed or peeled during machining. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims at solving the aforementioned problems. That is, the first object of the present invention is to provide a stator core for a magnetic bearing, such that even if there are portions extended circumferentially around the core, the core can be made with laminated steel sheets, can avoid the laminated steel sheets becoming detached, crushed or peeled, can be efficiently cut and processed, can also be made of an amorphous material which cannot otherwise be easily laminated, thus enabling the manufacturing and processing costs to be reduced, and can greatly reduce the eddy currents generated in the stator core, and the manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The second object of the present invention is to offer a stator core for a magnetic bearing, that has a structure which allows a high utilization of the component material, or the core can be processed with high precision, or one in which the generation of eddy currents is kept to a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above-mentioned first object, the present invention provides such a stator core for a magnetic bearing that is a stator core for a homo-polar magnetic bearing in which the toothed ends of the stator cores are close to each other in the axial direction and form N poles and S poles, wherein the stator cores (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) have portions (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) protruding from adjacent N poles and S poles that are extended circumferentially so as to be in contact with or in close proximity to each other and are made of laminated steel sheets that are interspaced with an insulating material and have a U-shape which is open on the center side when viewed from the side of the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Using this configuration, the production of eddy currents can be drastically reduced, thereby the rotor losses, due to the heat generated by the eddy currents can be greatly reduced. Because the stator core (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is composed of laminated steel sheets with a U shape such that the center side is open when viewed from the side of the axis of the shaft, even the protruding portions (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) that are in contact with or are located close to each other can be integrated into one body together with the coils. Therefore, the laminated steel in the protruding tips (protruded portions) can be an integral part of the same steel sheet as that in the location of the coils, so a laminated structure can withstand processing work without becoming collapsed, and also avoiding becoming detached, crushed or peeled, thereby the sheet can be efficiently cut and processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Moreover, because the cores can be processed after being formed and cut, even an amorphous material etc. that cannot be easily laminated can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aforementioned U-shaped laminated steel cores (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) are manufactured from a continuous steel sheet (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) coated with an insulation material that is wound into a rectangular shape and then cut into equal parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Using this configuration, such stator cores (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) have protruding portions (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) composed of adjacent N and S poles extending circumferentially so as to be in contact with or in close proximity to each other and are composed of U-shaped laminated steel sheets with an insulating material between the laminations and the U shape is such that the center side is open when viewed from the side of the shaft, the cores can be processed quickly and efficiently by processing the outer shape and cutting the inside of the cut cores (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, the cut cores (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), are wound into a rectangular shape with a center opening of predetermined dimensions and can be formed quickly and easily. Moreover, by dividing this wound rectangular shape, into two equal parts with a cutting machine, U-shaped laminated steel sheets each of which is isolated with an insulating material can be easily fabricated. Furthermore, high-cost punching dies need not be used, but simple and compact wrapping dies can be used to manufacture the cut cores, so the manufacturing costs can be reduced, laminating work can be omitted, and therefore, productivity can be improved. In addition, the scrap material that might otherwise be produced from the center parts of steel sheets during punching work when using punching dies can be avoided, therefore, the yield of steel sheets can be improved drastically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention presents a method of manufacturing cores for a magnetic bearing, including an outside machining step (A) wherein the outside surfaces of the cut cores (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) fabricated by wrapping a continuous steel sheet coated with an insulating material into a rectangular shape and then cut into equal parts are machined to leave protrusions (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), a coil assembling step (B) for assembling coils onto cut cores after the outside has been machined, a core assembling step (C) in which a plurality of cut cores are assembled at the required locations, and an inner cutting step (D) for cutting the inside of a plurality of cut cores after assembly at the required locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Using the aforementioned method, cutting the inside of a plurality of cut cores can be completed in one operation, and the cores can be machined with an excellent concentricity. In addition, the inner surfaces of the ends of the teeth can be cut in the direction of the sheet laminations and in the plane of the laminations during rotation, without imposing a biasing or bending load, therefore, the cut surfaces of the steel sheets remain smooth and regular without the insulating material becoming crushed, broken or peeled, so that a satisfactory excellent roundness can be preserved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention offers a method of manufacturing cores for a magnetic bearing, that includes an inside cutting step (E) wherein a plurality of cut cores (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) fabricated by wrapping a continuous steel sheet coated with an insulating material into a rectangular shape and, forming and cutting it into equal parts are assembled in the required positions and the inside thereof is cut, an outside machining step (F) in which the outside of the plurality of cut cores are machined leaving protrusions (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), and a coil assembling step (G) wherein the plurality of cut cores of which the outside has been machined are fitted with coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to this method of the present invention, cutting the inner surface is required twice, however, the number of machining steps can be reduced. In addition, when the inner periphery of the toothed ends is cut during rotation, the cutting work can be carried out in the direction of the lamination and in the horizontal plane of the steel sheets on the inner periphery of the toothed ends, without producing a bias load or deflection, therefore, the cut edges of the steel sheets can be kept smooth without any irregularity at the edge of each cut, and the peripheries of the cores can be kept smooth and truly circular without any collapsing, tearing or peeling of the insulating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> To achieve the aforementioned second object of the present invention, the invention provides stator cores for a magnetic bearing, composed of a first yoke (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) that is used for a homo-polar magnetic bearing for supporting a rotor (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) provided with a supporting surface made of a magnetic material, and one end of which forms the magnetic pole surface opposite the above-mentioned supporting surface with a predetermined width to pass magnetic flux, that is, a first pole body, a second yoke (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) one end of which forms a magnetic pole surface opposite the aforementioned supporting surface with a predetermined width to pass the magnetic flux, that is, a second pole body, and a stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) that is arranged between and in close contact with the other ends of the above-mentioned first yoke and the aforementioned second yoke and passes the magnetic flux between them, wherein the aforementioned first yoke (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and the above-mentioned second yoke (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) are regularly arranged opposite each other in the lateral direction of the aforementioned pole body, and at least the stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is fabricated from a magnetic material powder, solidified in a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Using this configuration, since the first yoke (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and second yoke (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) are integrated into a U-shape and the stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is made of the magnetic material powder solidified in resin, when the magnet is energized, the flux passes through the first yoke (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), rotor (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), second yoke (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), in a closed path; since the magnetic pole surfaces at the ends of the first yoke (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and the second yoke (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) support the rotor (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) at the supporting surfaces, and as the magnetic material powder solidified in resin produces only a small amount of eddy current loss, eddy currents are not generated in the stem unit (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), so a magnetic bearing with few losses can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention, the aforementioned first pole body (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is a laminated body in which magnetic steel sheets are laminated in the direction orthogonal to a line normal to the above-mentioned magnetic pole surface, interleaved with a non-conducting substance, and the above-mentioned second pole body (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is a laminated body fabricated from magnetic steel sheets laminated in the direction orthogonal to a line normal to the aforementioned magnetic pole surface, with a non-conducting substance between the laminations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration described above, since the first pole body (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and the second pole body (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) are provided with laminated bodies fabricated from magnetic steel sheets laminated in the direction orthogonal to a line normal to the above-mentioned magnetic pole surfaces, with a non-conducting substance between the laminations, eddy current losses due to flux passing through the yokes can be suppressed, so a magnetic bearing with further reduced losses can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition, the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention are contrived in such a manner that the aforementioned first pole body (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is a laminated body fabricated from magnetic steel sheets laminated in the lateral direction with a non-conducting substance interleaved between each sheet, and the above-mentioned second pole body (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is a laminated body in which the magnetic steel sheets are laminated in the lateral direction with a non-conducting substance sandwiched between each sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, since the first pole body (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and the second pole body (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) have laminated bodies made of magnetic steel sheets laminated in the lateral direction with a non-conducting substance sandwiched between the sheets, eddy current losses generated when the magnetic flux flows through yokes can be suppressed, so a magnetic bearing with further reduced losses can be offered in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the stator cores for a magnetic bearing that supports a rotor (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) with a supporting surface composed of a magnetic material according to the present invention are formed with N-pole magnetic pole surfaces opposite the aforementioned supporting surface and S-pole magnetic pole surfaces facing the above-mentioned supporting surface, and are made of a magnetic material powder, solidified in resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Using the above-mentioned configuration, N-pole magnetic pole surfaces and S-pole magnetic pole surfaces are opposite the supporting surface, therefore, when magnetic flux is passed through the stator cores of a magnetic bearing, N-pole magnetic pole surfaces and S-pole magnetic pole surfaces support the supporting surface of the rotor; because the magnetic material powder, solidified in resin, produces a small amount of eddy current losses, eddy current losses can be suppressed so realizing a magnetic bearing with reduced losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention incorporate the rotating shaft of the rotor, eddy current losses are reduced, so the magnetic bearing for a rotor with a small amount of losses can be developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below referring to the drawings. Common portions shown in each drawing are identified with the same numbers, and no duplicate descriptions are given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> show stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention. As shown in the figures, the magnetic bearing incorporates stator cores for a homo-polar magnetic bearing, like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, wherein the toothed ends of the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> form N poles and S poles adjacent to each other in the axial direction, and surround a rotor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention, the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are provided with protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> extending in the circumferential direction from adjacent N and S poles so as to be in contact with or in close proximity to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> typically shows the method of manufacturing U-shaped laminated steel sheets for the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, U-shaped laminated steel sheets for the cut cores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are manufactured by wrapping a continuous steel sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coated with an insulation material into a rectangular shape, forming it and cutting it in equal parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention are composed of U-shaped laminated steel sheets interleaved with insulating material, and with the center sides open when viewed from the centerline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</cross-reference> show the first embodiment of stator cores according to the present invention. In the figures, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is an isometric view showing the arrangement of 4 stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the case in which the number of magnetic poles is 4, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is an illustration of one of the cores after it has been machined on the outside, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> is a plan view of the arrangement of the 4 stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In each view, broken lines represent the cutting surfaces on the cut cores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</cross-reference>, protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> extend circumferentially, and come in point contact (more accurately in 3 dimensions, line contact) with each other at point A on a plane. However, the protrusions can also be made to be in close proximity to each other with a small gap, instead of a point contact. Also, the present invention is not limited only to a case with 4 magnetic poles, in other words, 3 or 5 or more poles can be incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned configuration can greatly reduce the production of eddy currents because there is no gap or only a very small gap between the protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby heat and losses due to eddy currents generated in the rotor can be greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> show the second embodiment of the stator cores according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows one of the four stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after it has been machined on the outside, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the arrangement of the four stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In each drawing, broken lines indicate where the cut cores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are cut to form the stator core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, the protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are extended in the circumferential direction and come in contact with each other at the point A in the plan view. Also in this embodiment, the number of magnetic poles is not limited only to 4, but 3 or 5 poles can be incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Because there are no gaps between protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in this configuration, the generation of eddy currents can be reduced significantly, thus heat and losses due to eddy currents produced in the rotor can be greatly reduced. In addition, since the protrusions contact each other in that planes, the core can be easily located and the inner periphery can be precisely cut and processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are formed from laminated steel sheets shaped like the letter _U,_ of which the center side is open when viewed from the side of the shaft, therefore, the protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> contact each other or are located close to each other and the cut cores can be integrated into one body together with coils. Consequently, the laminated steel sheets in the protruding tips (protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) are the same steel sheets as those where the coils are located, so the layers of laminations prevent the sheets from collapsing during processing, and also detachment, crushing or peeling of the laminations can be avoided, and the cores can be efficiently cut and processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Because the cores can be machined after being formed from the cut cores, even an amorphous material that cannot be easily laminated can be used in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> (Manufacturing Method 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the method of manufacturing stator cores according to the present invention. This method of the present invention consists of an outside machining step (A), a coil assembling step (B), a core assembling step (C) and an inside cutting step (D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the outside machining step (A), a cut core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> manufactured by winding a continuous steel sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coated with an insulating material into a rectangular shape, that has been formed and then cut into equal parts, beforehand, is machined on the outside thereof leaving the protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the coil assembling step (B), a coil is installed on the cut core <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the outside of which has been machined. In the core assembling step (C), a plurality (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in this example) of cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are arranged in the prescribed positions. In the inside cutting step (D), the inside of the plurality of cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that have been placed in position is cut, thereby the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the manufacturing method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the inside of the plurality of cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be completed at one time, and the cut surfaces can be made very accurate and concentric. When the inner periphery of each toothed end is cut, the cutting tool moves in the direction of the lamination and in the plane of the layers of laminations on the inner periphery of the toothed ends, so no eccentric loading or bending takes place, the layers of steel sheets remain laminated without any irregularities due to cutting, the insulating material is prevented from being crushed or torn or otherwise peeled off, and this ensures that the inner surface is smooth and truly circular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> (Manufacturing Method 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows another method of manufacturing stator cores according to the present invention. The manufacturing method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> according to the present invention incorporates an inside cutting step (E), an outside machining step (F) and a coil assembling step (G). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the inside cutting step (E), cut cores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that have been manufactured by winding a continuous steel sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coated with an insulating material into a rectangular shape, and the rectangle has been formed and then cut into two equal parts beforehand, a plurality (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in this example) of cut cores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are assembled in the required positions and the inside thereof is cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the outside machining step (F), the outside and inside surfaces of the plurality of cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are machined, leaving protrusions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the outside of the cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the coil assembling step (G), coils are installed on the plurality of cut cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of which the outside has been machined, thus the manufacturing of the stator cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Although the manufacturing method in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> requires the inside surface to be cut twice, the number of machining processes can be reduced. In addition, when the inner periphery of the toothed ends is cut and processed by rotating the cores, the cutting work can be carried out both in the direction of laminating and in the plane of the layers of laminations on the inner surface of toothed ends, without producing an eccentric load or bending force, so the cut edges of the steel sheets remain smooth and free from roughness, and the insulating material is prevented from being peeled off due to crushing or tearing, thereby ensuring that the inner surface is smooth and truly circular. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Although the combination of stator cores <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is described based on the above-mentioned A type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, this is not restrictive, and any of types A through D can be employed. </paragraph>

Since the construction of the magnetic bearing is the same as that of the third embodiment, no description is given below, and only the construction of the stator core (type F) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Although the figures illustrate the aforementioned A type in the combination of stator cores <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the design is not restricted only to type A, but any of A through D types can be used in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The widths near the magnetic pole surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are extended circumferentially along the rotor supporting surface, and are integrated with or in close proximity with the magnetic pole surfaces of adjacent electromagnetic components, that is, stator cores <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> (Ninth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a magnetic bearing and its stator core (type G) according to the ninth embodiment are described. The magnetic bearing of the ninth embodiment is a hetero-polar radial magnetic bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The stator core <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is entirely made from a magnetic material powder, solidified in resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the third through ninth embodiments is described. In the following descriptions, the magnetic bearing is energized by direct current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a diagram comparing the magnetic characteristics of a solid made from a magnetic material powder solidified in resin with the magnetic characteristics of a general-purpose silicon steel sheet (0.35 mm thick) normally used as the material for laminated steel sheets. Obviously, the magnetic material powder solidified in resin has a larger hysteresis loss and a smaller eddy current loss than the general-purpose silicon steel sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic bearing of the third through ninth embodiments is energized with direct current, magnetic flux passes between the stator core and the rotor. For instance, the magnetic flux flows in a closed path from the counter-magnetic pole surface to the magnetic pole surface of the first yoke <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, through the surface of the rotor, through the second yoke <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the magnetic pole surface to the counter-magnetic pole surface, through the stem unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, back to the first yoke. The magnetic flux path is curved in 3 dimensions and the flux flows through a place on the second yoke <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the stem unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and through another place on the stem unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the first yoke, however because the stem unit is composed of a material in which an extremely small amount of eddy currents are produced, eddy current losses can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the magnetic bearing is driven by direct current that contains very few AC components, so the hysteresis losses produced in the stator core are negligibly small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Therefore, using any of the stator cores according to the third through ninth embodiments, a magnetic bearing with small eddy current losses can be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When using a stator core of any of the third through eighth embodiments, since the peripheral widths near the magnetic pole surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of yokes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are extended along the outer surface of the rotor, periodic variations in the intensity of the magnetic field produced on the surface of the rotor can be minimized when the rotor rotates, so eddy current losses created on the rotor surface can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> When one of types A through C is introduced into the stator cores for the seventh and eighth embodiments, since the magnetic pole surfaces are curved surfaces in the magnetic steel sheets of the yokes, even when the curved surface is machined by a lathe, the surfaces of the magnetic steel sheets can satisfactorily resist machining forces, so the laminated steel sheets are no longer peeled off so that a highly accurate curved surface can be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> When one of the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the above-mentioned embodiments is used, the magnetic bearing has few eddy current losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When any of the stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the third through fifth (types A, B and C) embodiments is used, the features of laminated steel sheets and advantageous characteristics of a body made of magnetic material powder solidified in resin are effectively combined, and a magnetic bearing with small eddy current and hysteresis losses can be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Using stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the sixth (type D) or ninth (type G) embodiments, electromagnetic components can be precisely fabricated with no laminations concerning the shape, so various requests for designing a magnetic bearing can be flexibly satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Using stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the third through eighth (types A, B, C, D, E and F) embodiments, eddy current losses on the surface of a rotor can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiments, a radial bearing was taken as an example, however, applicable bearings in practice are not limited only to this example, and the present invention can also be applied to a thrust bearing. In addition, although the descriptions were given assuming a structure for supporting a rotating rotor, the invention is not limited only to this example, but for instance, the present invention can also be applied to a guide for a linear motion drive. In addition, the foregoing descriptions referred to examples wherein a stator core was composed of one component or three components, but the scope of the present invention is not restricted only to these compositions, and two components or four or more components can be used for the composition. A biasing magnet may also be included as part of a stator core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned stator cores for a magnetic bearing and the method of manufacturing them offer the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> 1. Since the laminated steel sheets of a cut core are bonded satisfactorily, protrusions of a magnetic pole can also be fabricated in a laminated structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> 2. Protrusions are joined together magnetically but are isolated electrically, so losses can be reduced without degrading the characteristics of the bearing. That is, using cut cores, the protrusions of magnetic poles can also be made of laminated steel sheets, resulting in a reduction of iron losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> 3. A wider selection of types of electromagnetic steel sheets becomes possible, and amorphous materials that are difficult to laminate can also be used for the magnetic poles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the stator core for a magnetic bearing and the method of manufacturing it according to the present invention can be composed of laminated steel sheets even if the stator cores are provided with protrusions extending in the circumferential direction; in addition, laminated steel sheets can be prevented from becoming detached, crushed or peeled, so they can be efficiently cut and machined; furthermore, an amorphous material that is difficult to laminate can be used as a raw material; consequently, the cost of manufacturing and machining the stator cores can be reduced, while the eddy currents generated in the stator unit can also be greatly reduced, which are excellent advantages in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, stator cores for a homo-polar magnetic bearing that supports a rotating body provide the following effects due to the configuration thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Since the first yoke, stem unit and second yoke are integrated into a U shape and the stem unit is made of a magnetic material powder solidified in resin, when magnetic flux is passed through them, the flux passes in a closed path through the first yoke, the moving body, the second yoke and the stem unit, whereby magnetic pole surfaces at one end of each of the first and second yokes support the rotor at the supporting surfaces; because the magnetic material powder solidified in resin does not generate eddy currents, the stem unit produces little eddy current loss, so a magnetic bearing with low losses can be offered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the first pole body and the second pole body are laminated bodies that are composed of magnetic steel sheets interleaved with a non-conducting substance and laminated in a direction orthogonal to a line normal to the aforementioned magnetic pole surfaces, when magnetic flux passes through the yokes, eddy current losses are suppressed and a magnetic bearing with still lower losses can be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the first pole body and the second pole body are laminated bodies made of magnetic steel sheets interleaved with a non-conducting material and laminated in the lateral direction, eddy current losses produced when magnetic flux is passed through the yokes are suppressed, so a magnetic bearing with even lower losses can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the present invention as described above, stator cores for a magnetic bearing used to support a rotor with a magnetic supporting surface are provided with a N-pole magnetic pole surface and S-pole magnetic pole surface facing the supporting surface, therefore when magnetic flux is passed through the stator cores of the magnetic bearing, N-pole and S-pole magnetic pole surfaces support the supporting surface of the rotor; because the magnetic material powder solidified in resin produces low eddy current losses, the losses are suppressed, so a magnetic bearing with low losses can be presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Also, when stator cores for a magnetic bearing according to the present invention support a rotating body, eddy current losses are suppressed and a low loss magnetic bearing for a rotor can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, the present invention provides stator cores for a magnetic bearing constructed in such a way that the utilization of materials is high, the work pieces can be machined with a high accuracy, and eddy currents are reduced to a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described referring to a number of preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the scope of rights included in the present invention is not restricted only to these embodiments. Conversely, the scope of rights of the present invention should include all improvements, modifications and equivalent entities that belong to the scope of the attached claims. </paragraph>
