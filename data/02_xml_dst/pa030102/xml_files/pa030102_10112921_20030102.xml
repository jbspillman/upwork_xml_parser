<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to compositions and methods for treating cancer and other angiogenic-dependent diseases, and more specifically, to compositions comprising anti-angiogenic factors and polymeric carriers, stents which have been coated with such compositions, as well as method for utilizing these stents and compositions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Angiogenesis-dependent diseases (i.e., those diseases which require or induce vascular growth) represent a significant portion of all diseases for which medical treatment is sought. For example, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and accounts for over one-fifth of the total mortality. Briefly, cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled division of a population of cells which, most typically, leads to the formation of one or more tumors. Such tumors are also characterized by the ingrowth of vasculature which provide various factors that permit continued tumor growth. Although cancer is generally more readily diagnosed than in the past, many forms, even if detected early, are still incurable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods are presently utilized to treat cancer, including for example, various surgical procedures. If treated with surgery alone however, many patients (particularly those with certain types of cancer, such as breast, brain, colon and hepatic cancer) will experience recurrence of the cancer. Therefore, in addition to surgery, many cancers are also treated with a combination of therapies involving cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-FU, etc.) and/or radiation therapy. One difficulty with this approach, however, is that radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents are toxic to normal tissues, and often create life-threatening side effects. In addition, these approaches often have extremely high failure/remission rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to surgical, chemo- and radiation therapies, others have attempted to utilize an individual&apos;s own immune system in order to eliminate cancerous cells. For example, some have suggested the use of bacterial or viral components as adjuvants in order to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. (See generally &ldquo;Principles of Cancer Biotherapy,&rdquo; Oldham (ed.), Raven Press, New York, 1987.) Such agents have generally been useful as adjuvants and as nonspecific stimulants in animal tumor models, but have not as of yet proved to be generally effective in humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Lymphokines have also been utilized in the treatment of cancer. Briefly, lymphokines are secreted by a variety of cells, and generally have an effect on specific cells in the generation of an immune response. Examples of lymphokines include Interleukins (IL)-1, -2, -3, and -4, as well as colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF. Recently, one group has utilized &lsqb;IL-2 to stimulate peripheral blood cells in order to expand and produce large quantities of cells which are cytotoxic to tumor cells (Rosenberg et al., <highlight><italic>N Engl. J Med. </italic></highlight>313:1485-1492, 1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Others have suggested the use of antibodies in the treatment of cancer. Briefly, antibodies may be developed which recognize certain cell surface antigens that are either unique, or more prevalent on cancer cells compared to normal cells. These antibodies, or &ldquo;magic bullets,&rdquo; may be utilized either alone or conjugated with a toxin in order to specifically target and kill tumor cells (Dillman, &ldquo;Antibody Therapy,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Principles of Cancer Biotherapy, </italic></highlight>Oldham (ed.), Raven Press, Ltd., New York, 1987). However, one difficulty is that most monoclonal antibodies are of murine origin, and thus hypersensitivity against the murine antibody may limit its efficacy, particularly after repeated therapies. Common side effects include fever, sweats and chills, skin rashes, arthritis, and nerve palsies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One additional difficulty of present methods is that local recurrence and local disease control remains a major challenge in the treatment of malignancy. In particular, a total of 630,000 patients annually (in the U.S.) have localized disease (no evidence of distant metastatic spread) at the time of presentation; this represents 64% of al those patients diagnosed with malignancy (this does not include nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ). For the vast majority of these patients, surgical resection of the disease represents the greatest chance for a cure and indeed 428,000 will be cured after the initial treatment&mdash;428,000. Unfortunately, 202,000 (or 32% of all patients with localized disease) will relapse after the initial treatment. Of those who relapse, the number who will relapse due to local recurrence of the disease amounts to 133,000 patients annually (or 21% of all those with localized disease). The number who will relapse due to distant metastases of the disease is 68,000 patients annually (11% of all those with localized disease). Another 102,139 patients annually will die as a direct result of an inability to control the local growth of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Nowhere is this problem more evident than in breast cancer, which affects 186,000 women annually in the U.S. and whose mortality rate has remained unchanged for 50 years. Surgical resection of the disease through radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, or lumpectomy remains the mainstay of treatment for this condition. Unfortunately, 39% of those treated with lumpectomy alone will develop a recurrence of the disease, and surprisingly, so will 25% of those in which the resection margin is found to be clear of tumor histologically. As many as 90% of these local recurrences will occur within 2 cm of the previous excision site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in 1991, over 113,000 deaths and 238,600 new cases of liver metastasis were reported in North America alone. The mean survival time for patients with liver metastases is only 6.6 months once liver lesions have developed. Non-surgical treatment for hepatic metastases include systemic chemotherapy, radiation, chemoembolization, hepatic arterial chemotherapy, and intraarterial radiation. However, despite evidence that such treatments can transiently decrease the size of the hepatic lesions (e.g., systemic chemotherapy and hepatic arterial chemotherapy initially reduces lesions in 15-20%, and 80% of patients, respectively), the lesions invariably reoccur. Surgical resection of liver metastases represents the only possibility for a cure, but such a procedure is possible in only 5% of patients with metastases, and in only 15-20% of patients with primary hepatic cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One method that has been attempted for the treatment of tumors with limited success is therapeutic embolization. Briefly, blood vessels which nourish a tumor are deliberately blocked by injection of an embolic material into the vessels. A variety of materials have been attempted in this regard, including autologous substances such as fat, blood clot, and chopped muscle fragments, as well as artificial materials such as wool, cotton, steel balls, plastic or glass beads, tantalum powder, silicone compounds, radioactive particles, sterile absorbable gelatin sponge (Sterispon, Gelfoam), oxidized cellulose (Oxycel), steel coils, alcohol, lyophilized human dura mater (Lyodura), microfibrillar collagen (Avitene), collagen fibrils (Tachotop), polyvinyl alcohol sponge (PVA; Ivalon), Barium-impregnated silicon spheres (Biss) and detachable balloons. The size of liver metastases may be temporarily decreased utilizing such methods, but tumors typically respond by causing the growth of new blood vessels into the tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A related problem to tumor formation is the development of cancerous blockages which inhibit the flow of material through body passageways, such as the bile ducts, trachea, esophagus, vasculature and urethra. One device, the stent, has been developed in order to hold open passageways which have been blocked by tumors or other substances. Representative examples of common stents include the Wallstent, Strecker stent, Gianturco stent, and the Palmaz stent. The major problem with stents, however, is that they do not prevent the ingrowth of tumor or inflammatory material through the interstices of the stent. If this material reaches the inside of a stent and compromises the stent lumen, it may result in blockage of the body passageway into which it has been inserted. In addition, presence of a stent in the body may induce reactive or inflammatory tissue (e.g., blood vessels, fibroblasts, white blood cells) to enter the stent lumen, resulting in partial or complete closure of the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides compositions and methods suitable for treating cancers, as well as other non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent diseases, and further provides other related advantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention provides methods and compositions which utilize anti-angiogenic factors. Briefly, within the context of the present invention, anti-angiogenic factors should be understood to include any protein, peptide, chemical, or other molecule, which acts to inhibit vascular growth. A variety of methods may be readily utilized to determine the anti-angiogenic activity of a given factor, including for example, chick chorioallantoic membrane (&ldquo;CAM&rdquo;) assays. Briefly, as described in more detail below in Examples 2A and 2C, a portion of the shell from a freshly fertilized chicken egg is removed, and a methyl cellulose disk containing a sample of the anti-angiogenic factor to be tested is placed on the membrane. After several days (e.g., 48 hours), inhibition of vascular growth by the sample to be tested may be readily determined by visualization of the chick chorioallantoic membrane in the region surrounding the methyl cellulose disk. Inhibition of vascular growth may also be determined quantitatively, for example, by determining the number and size of blood vessels surrounding the methyl cellulose disk, as compared to a control methyl cellulose disk. Although anti-angiogenic factors as described herein are considered to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels if they do so in merely a statistically significant manner, as compared to a control, within preferred aspects such anti-angiogenic factors will completely inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, as well as reduce the size and number of previously existing vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In addition to the CAM assay described above, a variety of other assays may also be utilized to determine the efficacy of anti-angiogenic factors in vivo, including for example, mouse models which have been developed for this purpose (see Roberston et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer. Res. </italic></highlight>51:1339-1344, 1991). In addition, a variety of representative in vivo assays relating to various aspects of the inventions described herein have also been described in more detail below in Examples 5 to 7, and 17 to 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention provides compositions comprising an anti-angiogenic factor, and a polymeric carrier. Briefly, a wide variety of anti-angiogenic factors may be readily utilized within the context of the present invention. Representative examples include Anti-Invasive Factor, retinoic acid and derivatives thereof, paclitaxel, Suramin, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-2, and various forms of the lighter &ldquo;d group&rdquo; transition metals. These and other anti-angiogenic factors will be discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>

Within alternative embodiments, hydrophobic compounds may be contained within a hydrophobic core, and this core contained within a hydrophilic shell. For example, as described in Example 38, paclitaxel may be incorporated into a hydrophobic core (e.g., of the poly D,L lactic acid-PEG or MePEG aggregate) which has a hydrophilic shell. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Arterial Embolization </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In addition to the compositions described above, the present invention also provides a variety of methods which utilize the above-described anti-angiogenic compositions. In particular, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for embolizing a blood vessel, comprising the step of delivering into the vessel a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic composition (as described above), such that the blood vessel is effectively occluded. Therapeutically effective amounts suitable for occluding blood vessels may be readily determined given the disclosure provided below, and as described in Example 6. Within a particularly preferred embodiment, the anti-angiogenic composition is delivered to a blood vessel which nourishes a tumor (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Briefly, there are a number of clinical situations (e.g., bleeding, tumor development) where it is desirable to reduce or abolish the blood supply to an organ or region. As described in greater detail below, this may be accomplished by injecting anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention into a desired blood vessel through a selectively positioned catheter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The composition travels via the blood stream until it becomes wedged in the vasculature, thereby physically (or chemically) occluding the blood vessel. The reduced or abolished blood flow to the selected area results in infarction (cell death due to an inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients) or reduced blood loss from a damaged vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For use in embolization therapy, anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention are preferably non-toxic, thrombogenic, easy to inject down vascular catheters, radio-opaque, rapid and permanent in effect, sterile, and readily available in different shapes or sizes at the time of the procedure. In addition, the compositions preferably result in the slow (ideally, over a period of several weeks to months) release of an anti-angiogenic factor. Particularly preferred anti-angiogenic compositions should have a predictable size of 15-200 &mgr;m after being injected into the vascular system. Preferably, they should not clump into larger particles either in solution or once injected. In addition, preferable compositions should not change shape or physical properties during storage prior to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Embolization therapy may be utilized in at least three principal ways to assist in the management of neoplasms: (1) definitive treatment of tumors (usually benign); (2) for preoperative embolization; and (3) for palliative embolization. Briefly, benign tumors may sometimes be successfully treated by embolization therapy alone. Examples of such tumors include simple tumors of vascular origin (e.g., haemangiomas), endocrine tumors such as parathyroid adenomas, and benign bone tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> For other tumors, (e.g., renal adenocarcinoma), preoperative embolization may be employed hours or days before surgical resection in order to reduce operative blood loss, shorten the duration of the operation, and reduce the risk of dissemination of viable malignant cells by surgical manipulation of the tumor. Many tumors may be successfully embolized preoperatively, including for example nasopharyngeal tumors, glomus jugular tumors, meningiomas, chemodectomas, and vagal neuromas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Embolization may also be utilized as a primary mode of treatment for inoperable malignancies, in order to extend the survival time of patients with advanced disease. Embolization may produce a marked improvement in the quality of life of patients with malignant tumors by alleviating unpleasant symptoms such as bleeding, venous obstruction and tracheal compression. The greatest benefit from palliative tumor embolization, however, may be seen in patients suffering from the humoral effects of malignant endocrine tumors, wherein metastases from carcinoid tumors and other endocrine neoplasms such as insulinomas and glucagonomas may be slow growing, and yet cause great distress by virtue of the endocrine syndromes which they produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In general, embolization therapy utilizing anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention is typically performed in a similar manner, regardless of the site. Briefly, angiography (a road map of the blood vessels) of the area to be embolized is first performed by injecting radiopaque contrast through a catheter inserted into an artery or vein (depending on the site to be embolized) as an X-ray is taken. The catheter may be inserted either percutaneously or by surgery. The blood vessel is then embolized by refluxing anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention through the catheter, until flow is observed to cease. Occlusion may be confirmed by repeating the angiogram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Embolization therapy generally results in the distribution of compositions containing anti-angiogenic factors throughout the interstices of the tumor or vascular mass to be treated. The physical bulk of the embolic particles clogging the arterial lumen results in the occlusion of the blood supply. In addition to this effect, the presence of an anti-angiogenic factor(s) prevents the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor or vascular mass, enhancing the devitalizing effect of cutting off the blood supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it should be evident that a wide variety of tumors may be embolized utilizing the compositions of the present invention. Briefly, tumors are typically divided into two classes: benign and malignant. In a benign tumor the cells retain their differentiated features and do not divide in a completely uncontrolled manner. In addition, the tumor is localized and nonmetastatic. In a malignant tumor, the cells become undifferentiated, do not respond to the body&apos;s growth and hormonal signals, and multiply in an uncontrolled manner; the tumor is invasive and capable of spreading to distant sites (metastasizing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Within one aspect of the present invention, metastases (secondary tumors) of the liver may be treated utilizing embolization therapy. Briefly, a catheter is inserted via the femoral or brachial artery and advanced into the hepatic artery by steering it through the arterial system under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter is advanced into the hepatic arterial tree as far as necessary to allow complete blockage of the blood vessels supplying the tumor(s), while sparing as many of the arterial branches supplying normal structures as possible. Ideally this will be a segmental branch of the hepatic artery, but it could be that the entire hepatic artery distal to the origin of the gastroduodenal artery, or even multiple separate arteries, will need to be blocked depending on the extent of tumor and its individual blood supply. Once the desired catheter position is achieved, the artery is embolized by injecting anti-angiogenic compositions (as described above) through the arterial catheter until flow in the artery to be blocked ceases, preferably even after observation for 5 minutes. Occlusion of the artery may be confirmed by injecting radiopaque contrast through the catheter and demonstrating by fluoroscopy or X-ray film that the vessel which previously filled with contrast no longer does so. The same procedure may be repeated with each feeding artery to be occluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As noted above, both benign and malignant tumors may be embolized utilizing compositions of the present invention. Representative examples of benign hepatic tumors include Hepatocellular Adenoma, Cavernous Haemangioma, and Focal Nodular Hyperplasia. Other benign tumors, which are more rare and often do not have clinical manifestations, may also be treated. These include Bile Duct Adenomas, Bile Duct Cystadenomas, Fibromas, Lipomas, Leiomyomas, Mesotheliomas, Teratomas, Myxomas, and Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Malignant Hepatic Tumors are generally subdivided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary tumors arise directly from the tissue in which they are found. Thus, a primary liver tumor is derived originally from the cells which make up the liver tissue (such as hepatocytes and biliary cells). Representative examples of primary hepatic malignancies which may be treated by arterial embolization include Hepatocellularcarcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Angiosarcoma, Cystadenocarcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Hepatoblastoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> A secondary tumor, or metastasis, is a tumor which originated elsewhere in the body but has now spread to a distant organ. The common routes for metastasis are direct growth into adjacent structures, spread through the vascular or lymphatic systems, and tracking along tissue planes and body spaces (peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). Secondary hepatic tumors are one of the most common causes of death in the cancer patient and are by far and away the most common form of liver tumor. Although virtually any malignancy can metastasize to the liver, tumors which are most likely to spread to the liver include: cancer of the stomach, colon, and pancreas; melanoma; tumors of the lung, oropharynx, and bladder; Hodgkin&apos;s and non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma; tumors of the breast, ovary, and prostate. Each one of the above-named primary tumors has numerous different tumor types which may be treated by arterial embolization (for example, there are over 32 different types of ovarian cancer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As noted above, embolization therapy utilizing anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may also be applied to a variety of other clinical situations where it is desired to occlude blood vessels. Within one aspect of the present invention, arteriovenous malformation may be treated by administration of one of the above-described compositions. Briefly, arteriovenous malformations (vascular malformations) refers to a group of diseases wherein at least one (and most typically, many) abnormal communications between arteries and veins occur, resulting in a local tumor-like mass composed predominantly of blood vessels. Such disease may be either congenital or acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment of the invention, an arteriovenous malformation may be treated by inserting a catheter via the femoral or brachial artery, and advancing it into the feeding artery under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter is preferably advanced as far as necessary to allow complete blockage of the blood vessels supplying the vascular malformation, while sparing as many of the arterial branches supplying normal structures as possible (ideally this will be a single artery, but most often multiple separate arteries may need to be occluded, depending on the extent of the vascular malformation and its individual blood supply). Once the desired catheter position is achieved, each artery may be embolized utilizing anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Within another aspect of the invention, embolization may be accomplished in order to treat conditions of excessive bleeding. For example, menorrhagia (excessive bleeding with menstruation) may be readily treated by embolization of uterine arteries. Briefly, the uterine arteries are branches of the internal iliac arteries bilaterally. Within one embodiment of the invention, a catheter may be inserted via the femoral or brachial artery, and advanced into each uterine artery by steering it through the arterial system under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter should be advanced as far as necessary to allow complete blockage of the blood vessels to the uterus, while sparing as many arterial branches that arise from the uterine artery and supply normal structures as possible. Ideally a single uterine artery on each side may be embolized, but occasionally multiple separate arteries may need to be blocked depending on the individual blood supply. Once the desired catheter position is achieved, each artery may be embolized by administration of the anti-angiogenic compositions as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In a like manner, arterial embolization may be accomplished in a variety of other conditions, including for example, for acute bleeding, vascular abnormalities, central nervous system disorders, and hypersplenism. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Use of Anti-Angiogenic Compositions as Coatings for Stents </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention also provides stents, comprising a generally tubular structure (which includes for example, spiral shapes), the surface of which is coated with a composition as described above. Briefly, a stent is a scaffolding, usually cylindrical in shape, that may be inserted into a body passageway (e.g., bile ducts) or a portion of a body passageway, which has been narrowed, irregularly contured, obstructed, or occluded by a disease process (e.g., ingrowth by a tumor) in order to prevent closure or reclosure of the passageway. Stents act by physically holding open the walls of the body passage into which they are inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A variety of stents may be utilized within the context of the present invention, including for example, esophageal stents, vascular stents, biliary stents, pancreatic stents, ureteric and urethral stents, lacrimal stents, Eustachian tube stents, fallopian tube stents and tracheal/bronchial stents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Stents may be readily obtained from commercial sources, or constructed in accordance with well-known techniques. Representative examples of stents include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,523, entitled &ldquo;Hydrogel Adhesive;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,337, entitled &ldquo;Expandable Intraluminal Graft, and Method and Apparatus for Implanting and Expandable Intraluminal Graft;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,126 entitled &ldquo;Endovascular Stent and Delivery System;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,998 entitled &ldquo;Indwelling Stent and Method of Use;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,435 entitled &ldquo;Self-Expanding Prosthesis Having Stable Axial Length;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,606, entitled &ldquo;Water-insoluble Polysaccharide Hydrogel Foam for Medical Applications;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,370, entitled &ldquo;Nitinol Stent for Hollow Body Conduits;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,626, entitled &ldquo;Indwelling Stent;&rdquo; U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,580, entitled &ldquo;Biodegradable polymeric Endoluminal Sealing Process;&rdquo; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,471, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Treatment of Focal Disease in Hollow Tubular Organs and Other Tissue Lumens.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Stents may be coated with anti-angiogenic compositions or anti-angiogenic factors of the present invention in a variety of manners, including for example: (a) by directly affixing to the stent an anti-angiogenic composition (e.g., by either spraying the stent with a polymer/drug film, or by dipping the stent into a polymer/drug solution), (b) by coating the stent with a substance such as a hydrogel which will in turn absorb the anti-angiogenic composition (or anti-angiogenic factor above), (c) by interweaving anti-angiogenic composition coated thread (or the polymer itself formed into a thread) into the stent structure, (d) by inserting the stent into a sleeve or mesh which is comprised of or coated with an anti-angiogenic composition, or (e) constructing the stent itself with an anti-angiogenic composition. Within preferred embodiments of the invention, the composition should firmly adhere to the stent during storage and at the time of insertion, and should not be dislodged from the stent when the diameter is expanded from its collapsed size to its full expansion size. The anti-angiogenic composition should also preferably not degrade during storage, prior to insertion, or when warmed to body temperature after expansion inside the body. In addition, it should preferably coat the stent smoothly and evenly, with a uniform distribution of angiogenesis inhibitor, while not changing the stent contour. Within preferred embodiments of the invention, the anti-angiogenic composition should provide a uniform, predictable, prolonged release of the anti-angiogenic factor into the tissue surrounding the stent once it has been deployed. For vascular stents, in addition to the above properties, the composition should not render the stent thrombogenic (causing blood clots to form), or cause significant turbulence in blood flow (more than the stent itself would be expected to cause if it was uncoated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for expanding the lumen of a body passageway, comprising inserting a stent into the passageway, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with an anti-angiogenic composition (or, an anti-angiogenic factor alone), such that the passageway is expanded. A variety of embodiments are described below wherein the lumen of a body passageway is expanded in order to eliminate a biliary, esophageal, tracheal/bronchial, urethral or vascular obstruction. In addition, a representative example is described in more detail below in Example 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Generally, stents are inserted in a similar fashion regardless of the site or the disease being treated. Briefly, a preinsertion examination, usually a diagnostic imaging procedure, endoscopy, or direct visualization at the time of surgery, is generally first performed in order to determine the appropriate positioning for stent insertion. A guidewire is then advanced through the lesion or proposed site of insertion, and over this is passed a delivery catheter which allows a stent in its collapsed form to be inserted. Typically, stents are capable of being compressed, so that they can be inserted through tiny cavities via small catheters, and then expanded to a larger diameter once they are at the desired location. Once expanded, the stent physically forces the walls of the passageway apart and holds them open. As such, they are capable of insertion via a small opening, and yet are still able to hold open a large diameter cavity or passageway. The stent may be self-expanding (e.g., the Wallstent and Gianturco stents), balloon expandable (e.g., the Palmaz stent and Strecker stent), or implanted by a change in temperature (e.g. the Nitinol stent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Stents are typically maneuvered into place under radiologic or direct visual control, taking particular care to place the stent precisely across the narrowing in the organ being treated. The delivery catheter is then removed, leaving the stent standing on its own as a scaffold. A post insertion examination, usually an x-ray, is often utilized to confirm appropriate positioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Within a preferred embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for eliminating biliary obstructions, comprising inserting a biliary stent into a biliary passageway, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with a composition as described above, such that the biliary obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, tumor overgrowth of the common bile duct results in progressive cholestatic jaundice which is incompatible with life. Generally, the biliary system which drains bile from the liver into the duodenum is most often obstructed by (1) a tumor composed of bile duct cells (cholangiocarcinoma), (2) a tumor which invades the bile duct (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma), or (3) a tumor which exerts extrinsic pressure and compresses the bile duct (e.g., enlarged lymph nodes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Both primary biliary tumors, as well as other tumors which cause compression of the biliary tree may be treated utilizing the stents described herein. One example of primary biliary tumors are adenocarcinomas (which are also called Klatskin tumors when found at the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct). These tumors are also referred to as biliary carcinomas, choledocholangiocarcinomas, or adenocarcinomas of the biliary system. Benign tumors which affect the bile duct (e.g., adenoma of the biliary system), and, in rare cases, squamous cell carcinomas of the bile duct and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder, may also cause compression of the biliary tree and therefore, result in biliary obstruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Compression of the biliary tree is most commonly due to tumors of the liver and pancreas which compress and therefore obstruct the ducts. Most of the tumors from the pancreas arise from cells of the pancreatic ducts. This is a highly fatal form of cancer (5% of all cancer deaths; 26,000 new cases per year in the U.S.) with an average of 6 months survival and a 1 year survival rate of only 10%. When these tumors are located in the head of the pancreas they frequently cause biliary obstruction, and this detracts significantly from the quality of life of the patient. While all types of pancreatic tumors are generally referred to as &ldquo;carcinoma of the pancreas&rdquo; there are histologic subtypes including: adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, cystadeno-carcinoma, and acinar cell carcinoma. Hepatic tumors, as discussed above, may also cause compression of the biliary tree, and therefore cause obstruction of the biliary ducts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment of the invention, a biliary stent is first inserted into a biliary passageway in one of several ways: from the top end by inserting a needle through the abdominal wall and through the liver (a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram or &ldquo;PTC&rdquo;); from the bottom end by cannulating the bile duct through an endoscope inserted through the mouth, stomach, and duodenum (an endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram or &ldquo;ERCP&rdquo;); or by direct incision during a surgical procedure. A preinsertion examination, PTC, ERCP, or direct visualization at the time of surgery should generally be performed to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion. A guidewire is then advanced through the lesion, and over this a delivery catheter is passed to allow the stent to be inserted in its collapsed form. If the diagnostic exam was a PTC, the guidewire and delivery catheter is inserted via the abdominal wall, while if the original exam was an ERCP the stent may be placed via the mouth. The stent is then positioned under radiologic, endoscopic, or direct visual control taking particular care to place it precisely across the narrowing in the bile duct. The delivery catheter is then removed leaving the stent standing as a scaffolding which holds the bile duct open. A further cholangiogram may be performed to document that the stent is appropriately positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Within yet another embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for eliminating esophageal obstructions, comprising inserting an esophageal stent into an esophagus, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with an anti-angiogenic composition as described above, such that the esophageal obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the esophagus is the hollow tube which transports food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. Cancer of the esophagus or invasion by cancer arising in adjacent organs (e.g. cancer of the stomach or lung) results in the inability to swallow food or saliva. Within this embodiment, a preinsertion examination, usually a barium swallow or endoscopy should generally be performed in order to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion. A catheter or endoscope may then be positioned through the mouth, and a guidewire is advanced through the blockage. A stent delivery catheter is passed over the guidewire under radiologic or endoscopic control, and a stent is placed precisely across the narrowing in the esophagus. A post insertion examination, usually a barium swallow x-ray, may be utilized to confirm appropriate positioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Within other embodiments of the invention, methods are provided for eliminating tracheal/bronchial obstructions, comprising inserting a tracheal/bronchial stent into the trachea or bronchi, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of which is coated with an anti-angiogenic composition as described above, such that the tracheal/bronchial obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the trachea and bronchi are tubes which carry air from the mouth and nose to the lungs. Blockage of the trachea by cancer, invasion by cancer arising in adjacent organs (e.g., cancer of the lung), or collapse of the trachea or bronchi due to chondromalacia (weakening of the cartilage rings) results in inability to breathe. Within this embodiment of the invention, preinsertion examination, usually an endoscopy, should generally be performed in order to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion. A catheter or endoscope is then positioned through the mouth, and a guidewire advanced through the blockage. A delivery catheter is then passed over the guidewire in order to allow a collapsed stent to be inserted. The stent is placed under radiologic or endoscopic control in order to place it precisely across the narrowing. The delivery catheter may then be removed leaving the stent standing as a scaffold on its own. A post insertion examination, usually a bronchoscopy may be utilized to confirm appropriate positioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Within another embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for eliminating urethral obstructions, comprising inserting a urethral stent into a urethra, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with an anti-angiogenic composition as described above, such that the urethral obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the urethra is the tube which drains the bladder through the penis. Extrinsic narrowing of the urethra as it passes through the prostate, due to hypertrophy of the prostate, occurs in virtually every man over the age of 60 and causes progressive difficulty with urination. Within this embodiment, a preinsertion examination, usually an endoscopy or urethrogram should generally first be performed in order to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion, which is above the external urinary sphincter at the lower end, and close to flush with the bladder neck at the upper end. An endoscope or catheter is then positioned through the penile opening and a guidewire advanced into the bladder. A delivery catheter is then passed over the guidewire in order to allow stent insertion. The delivery catheter is then removed, and the stent expanded into place. A post insertion examination, usually endoscopy or retrograde urethrogram, may be utilized to confirm appropriate position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Within another embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for eliminating vascular obstructions, comprising inserting a vascular stent into a blood vessel, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with an anti-angiogenic composition as described above, such that the vascular obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, stents may be placed in a wide array of blood vessels, both arteries and veins, to prevent recurrent stenosis at the site of failed angioplasties, to treat narrowings that would likely fail if treated with angioplasty, and to treat post surgical narrowings (e.g., dialysis graft stenosis). Representative examples of suitable sites include the iliac, renal, and coronary arteries, the superior vena cava, and in dialysis grafts. Within one embodiment, angiography is first performed in order to localize the site for placement of the stent. This is typically accomplished by injecting radiopaque contrast through a catheter inserted into an artery or vein as an x-ray is taken. A catheter may then be inserted either percutaneously or by surgery into the femoral artery, brachial artery, femoral vein, or brachial vein, and advanced into the appropriate blood vessel by steering it through the vascular system under fluoroscopic guidance. A stent may then be positioned across the vascular stenosis. A post insertion angiogram may also be utilized in order to confirm appropriate positioning. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Use of Anti-Angiogenic Compositions in Surgical Procedures </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As noted above, anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized in a wide variety of surgical procedures. For example, within one aspect of the present invention an anti-angiogenic compositions (in the form of, for example, a spray or film) may be utilized to coat or spray an area prior to removal of a tumor, in order to isolate normal surrounding tissues from malignant tissue, and/or to prevent the spread Of disease to surrounding tissues. Within other aspects of the present invention, anti-angiogenic compositions (e.g., in the form of a spray) may be delivered via endoscopic procedures in order to coat tumors, or inhibit angiogenesis in a desired locale. Within yet other aspects of the present invention, surgical meshes which have been coated with anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may be utilized in any procedure wherein a surgical mesh might be utilized. For example, within one embodiment of the invention a surgical mesh ladened with an anti-angiogenic composition may be utilized during abdominal cancer resection surgery (e.g., subsequent to colon resection) in order to provide support to the structure, and to release an amount of the anti-angiogenic factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Within further aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for treating tumor excision sites, comprising administering an anti-angiogenic composition as described above to the resection margins of a tumor subsequent to excision, such that the local recurrence of cancer and the formation of new blood vessels at the site is inhibited. Within one embodiment of the invention, the anti-angiogenic composition(s) (or anti-angiogenic factor(s) alone) are administered directly to the tumor excision site (e.g., applied by swabbing, brushing or otherwise coating the resection margins of the tumor with the anti-angiogenic composition(s) or factor(s)). Alternatively, the anti-angiogenic composition(s) or factor(s) may be incorporated into known surgical pastes prior to administration. Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the anti-angiogenic compositions are applied after hepatic resections for malignancy, and after neurosurgical operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Within one aspect of the present invention, anti-angiogenic compositions (as described above) may be administered to the resection margin of a wide variety of tumors, including for example, breast, colon, brain and hepatic tumors. For example, within one embodiment of the invention, anti-angiogenic compositions may be administered to the site of a neurological tumor subsequent to excision, such that the formation of new blood vessels at the site are inhibited. Briefly, the brain is highly functionally localized; i.e., each specific anatomical region is specialized to carry out a specific function. Therefore it is the location of brain pathology that is often more important than the type. A relatively small lesion in a key area can be far more devastating than a much larger lesion in a less important area. Similarly, a lesion on the surface of the brain may be easy to resect surgically, while the same tumor located deep in the brain may not (one would have to cut through too many vital structures to reach it). Also, even benign tumors can be dangerous for several reasons: they may grow in a key area and cause significant damage; even though they would be cured by surgical resection this may not be possible; and finally, if left unchecked they can cause increased intracranial pressure. The skull is an enclosed space incapable of expansion. Therefore, if something is growing in one location, something else must be being compressed in another location&mdash;the result is increased pressure m the skull or increased intracranial pressure. If such a condition is left untreated, vital structures can be compressed, resulting in death. The incidence of CNS (central nervous system) malignancies is 8-16 per 100,000. The prognosis of primary malignancy of the brain is dismal, with a median survival of less than one year, even following surgical resection. These tumors, especially gliomas, are predominantly a local disease which recur within 2 centimeters of the original focus of disease after surgical removal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Inflammatory Arthritis </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Inflammatory arthritis is a serious health problems in developed countries, particularly given the increasing number of aged individuals. For example, one form of inflammatory arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of unknown cause. Although many organs can be affected, RA is basically a severe form of chronic synovitis that sometimes leads to destruction and ankylosis of affected joints (taken from <highlight><italic>Robbins Pathological Basis of Disease, </italic></highlight>by R. S. Cotran, V. Kumar, and S. L. Robbins, W. B. Saunders Co., 1989). Pathologically the disease is characterized by a marked thickening of the synovial membrane which forms villous projections that extend into the joint space, multilayering of the synoviocyte lining (synoviocyte proliferation), infiltration of the synovial membrane with white blood cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and lymphoid follicles; called an &ldquo;inflammatory synovitis&rdquo;), and deposition of fibrin with cellular necrosis within the synovium. The tissue formed as a result of this process is called pannus and eventually the pannus grows to fill the joint space. The pannus develops an extensive network of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis which is essential to the evolution of the synovitis. Release of digestive enzymes &lsqb;matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., collagenase, stromelysin)&rsqb; and other mediators of the inflammatory process (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, superoxides, lysosomal enzymes, and products of arachadonic acid metabolism) from the cells of the pannus tissue leads to the progressive destruction of the cartilage tissue. The pannus invades the articular cartilage leading to erosions and fragmentation of the cartilage tissue. Eventually there is erosion of the subchondral bone with fibrous ankylosis and ultimately bony ankylosis, of the involved joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> It is generally believed, but not conclusively proven, that RA is an autoimmune disease, and that many different arthriogenic stimuli activate the immune response in the immunogenetically susceptible host. Both exogenous infectious agents (Ebstein-Barr Virus, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Virus, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus, Mycoplasma, and others) and endogenous proteins (collagen, proteoglycans, altered immunoglobulins) have been implicated as the causative agent which triggers an inappropriate host immune response. Regardless of the inciting agent, autoimmunity plays a role in the progression of the disease. In particular, the relevant antigen is ingested by antigen-presenting cells (macrophages or dendritic cells in the synovial membrane), processed, and presented to T lymphocytes. The T cells initiate a cellular immune response and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells. The end result is the production of an excessive inappropriate immune response directed against the host tissues &lsqb;e.g., antibodies directed against Type II collagen, antibodies directed against the Fc portion of autologous IgG (called &ldquo;Rheumatoid Factor&rdquo;)&rsqb;. This further amplifies the immune response and hastens the destruction of the cartilage tissue. Once this cascade is initiated numerous mediators of cartilage destruction are responsible for the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Thus, within one aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating or preventing inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic factor or anti-angiogenic composition to a joint. Within a preferred embodiment of the invention, anti-angiogenic factors (including anti-angiogenic compositions, as described above) may be administered directly by intra-articular injection, as a surgical paste, or as an oral agent (e.g. containing the anti-angiogenic factor thalidomide). One representative example of such a method is set forth in more detail below in Example 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As utilized within the context of the present invention, it should be understood that efficatious administration of the anti-angiogenic factors and compositions described herein may be assessed in several ways, including: (1) by preventing or lessening the pathological and/or clinical symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis; (2) by downregulating the white blood cell response which initiates the inflammatory cascade and results in synovitis, swelling, pain, and tissue destruction; (3) by inhibiting the &ldquo;tumor-like&rdquo; proliferation of synoviocytes that leads to the development of a locally invasive and destructive pannus tissue; (4) by decreasing the production/activity of matrix metalloproteinases produced by white blood cells, synoviocytes, chondrocytes, and endothelial cells, which degrade the cartilage matrix and result in irreversible destruction of the articular cartilage; and (5) by inhibiting blood vessel formation which provides the framework and nutrients necessary for the growth and development of the pannus tissue. Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic factors or compositions should not be toxic to normal chondrocytes at therapeutic levels. Each of these aspects will be discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> A. Inflammatory Response </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Neutrophils are found in abundance in the synovial fluid, but only in small numbers in the synovial membrane itself It is estimated that more than 1 billion neutrophils enter a moderately inflamed rheumatoid knee joint each day (Hollingsworth et al., 1967) and remain there because no pathway exists by which they can leave the joint. These cells release reactive free radicals and lysosomal enzymes which degrade the cartilage tissue. Other PMN products such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes augment the inflammatory response and recruit more inflammatory cells into the joint tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Lymphocytes, particularly T cells, are present in abundance in the diseased synovial tissue. Activated T cells produce a variety of lymphokines and cooperate with B cells to produce autoantibodies. T cells products result in the activation macrophages, a cell which is thought to have an important role in the pathology of the disease. The macrophages produce a variety destructive lysosomal enzymes, prostaglandins, and monokines and are also capable of stimulating angiogenesis. One of the more important monokines secreted by macrophages is IL-1. Briefly, IL-1 is known to: stimulate synthesis and release of collagenase by synoviocytes and synovial fibroblasts, inhibit proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes, activate osteoclasts, induce changes in the endothelium of the synovial vasculature &lsqb;stimulation of endothelial production of plasminogen activator and colony stimulating factor, expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, promotion of procoagulant activity (Wider et al., 1991)&rsqb;, and act as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes and neutrophils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment, downregulation of the white blood cell response, or inhibition of the inflammatory response, may be assessed by determination of the effect of the anti-angiogenic factor or anti-angiogenic composition on the response of neutrophils stimulated with opsonized CPPD crystals or opsonized zyrosan. Such methods are illustrated in more detail below in Example 22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> B. Synoviocyte Hyperplasia </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> During the development of RA, the synovial lining cells become activated by products of inflammation or through phagocytosis of immune complexes. Several subtypes of synovial lining cells have been identified and all of them become intensely activated and undergo excessive hyperplasia and growth when stimulated. As the synovial tissue organizes to form a pannus, the number of synoviocytes, blood vessels, connective tissue elements, and inflammatory cells increases to form a mass 100 times its original size. In many ways, the synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis behaves much like a localized neoplasia (Harris, 1990). In fact, cultured rheumatoid synovial cells develop the phenotypic characteristics of anchorage-independent growth usually associated with neoplastic cells if they given sufficient plateletderived growth factor (Lafyatis et al., 1989). In addition, the synoviocytes also produce large amounts of collagenase, stromelysin, prostaglandins, and Interleukin-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The tumor-like proliferation of the cells of the synovial connective tissue stroma (synoviocytes, fibroblast-like cells and neovascular tissue) produces a pannus with many features of a localized malignancy. Supporting this tumor analogy are several findings: the pannus expresses high levels of oncoproteins such as c-myc and c-fos, produces metalloproteinases to facilitate surrounding tissue invasion, express cytoskeletal markers characteristic of poorly differentiated mesenchymal tissue (e.g., vimentin); synoviocytes in vitro grow rapidly, do not contact inhibit, form foci, and can be grown under anchorage-independent conditions in soft agarose; and pannus tissue is capable of inducing the growth of a supporting vasculature (i.e. angiogenesis). All these findings are suggestive of a tissue in which normal growth regulation as been lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment, inhibition of synoviocyte proliferation may be determined by, for example, analysis of <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-thymidine incorporation into synoviocytes, or in vitro synoviocyte proliferation. Such methods are illustrated in more detail below in Example 23. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> C. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Irreparable degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix is believed to be largely due to the enzymatic action of matrix metalloproteinases on the components of the cartilage matrix. Although numerous other enzymes are likely involved in the development of RA, collagenase (MMP-1) and stromelysin (MMP-3) play an important role (Vincetti et al., 1994) in disease progression. These enzymes are capable of degrading type 11 collagen and proteoglycans respectively; the 2 major extracellular components of cartilage tissue. Cytokines such as IL-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor are all potent stimulators of collagenase and stromelysin production. As described above, numerous cell types found in the arthritic joint (white blood cells, synoviocytes, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes) are capable of synthesizing and secreting MMPS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In proliferating rheumatoid synovial tissue, collagenase and stromelysin become the major gene products of the pannus and may comprise as much as 2% of the messenger RNAs produced by the synovial fibroblasts (Brinkerhoff and Auble, 1990). Increased levels of collagenase and stromelysin are present in the cartilage of patients with RA and the level of enzyme activity in the joint correlates well with the severity of the lesion (Martel-Pelletier et al., 1993; Walakovitis et al., 1992). Because these enzymes are fundamental to the pathology of RA and result in irreversible cartilage damage, many therapeutic strategies have been devised to inhibit their effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Numerous naturally present inhibitors of MMP activity have been identified and named &ldquo;TIMPS&rdquo; for Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases. Many of these protein inhibitors bind with the active MMPs to form 1:1 noncovalent complexes which inactivate the MMP enzymes. The TIMPs are produced locally by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts and are likely responsible for the normal regulation of connective tissue degradation. It is thought that much of the damage to the cartilage matrix is due to a local imbalance between MMP and TIMP activity. This is probably due to increased production of metalloproteinases while the production of TIMPs remains at a normal or constant level (Vincetti et al., 1994). To overcome this, therapeutic strategies have been designed to add exogenous TIMPs (e.g., the chemically modified tetracycline molecules, collagen substrate analogues) or to upregulate TIMP production (retinoids, transforming growth factor &bgr;, IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M) in an effort to restore the enzymatic balance. However this approach has yet to translate into significant clinical results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach is to inhibit or downregulate the production of the MMPs to restore a normal balance of activity. Naturally occurring compounds (TNF&bgr;, all-trans retinoic acid) and synthetic compounds (retinoids, glucocorticoid hormones) have been demonstrated to inhibit MMP activity by suppressing transcription and synthesis of these proteins. A post-transcriptional method of blocking MMP release could also be expected to result in a decrease in the amount of MMP produced and an improved balance between MMP and TIMP activity in the joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment, a decrease in the production or activity of MMP&apos;s may be determined by, for example, analysis of IL-1 induced collagenase expression. One such method is illustrated in more detail below in Example 24. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> D. Angiogenesis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The development of an extensive network of new blood vessels is essential to the development of the synovitis present in rheumatoid arthritis (Harris, 1990; Folkman et al., 1989; Sano et al., 1990). Several local mediators such as plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-&bgr;, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are likely responsible for the induction and perpetuation of neovascularization within the synovium. Pannus tissue composed of new capillaries and synovial connective tissue invades and destroys the articular cartilage. The migrating angiogenic vessels themselves produce and secrete increased levels of metalloproteinases such as collagenase and stromelysin capable of degrading the cartilage matrix (Case et al., 1989). The newly formed vessels are also quite &ldquo;leaky&rdquo; with gaps present between the microvascular endothelial cells. This facilitates the exudation of plasma proteins into the synovium (which increases swelling), enhances WBCs movement from the circulation into the pannus tissue (which increases inflammation), and leads to the perivascular accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells (Wilder et al., 1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In summary, the endothelial tissue plays an important role in the development of this disease by expressing the necessary surface receptors to allow inflammatory cells to leave the circulation and enter the developing pannus, secreting proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading the cartilage matrix, and proliferating to form the new vessels (angiogenesis) required for the pannus tissue to increase in size and invade adjacent tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Within one embodiment, inhibition of new blood vessel formation may be readily determined in a variety of asays, including the CAM assay described above and within Example 2. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Neovascular Diseases of the Eye </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention also provides methods for treating neovascular diseases of the eye, including for example, corneal neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroblasia and macular degeneration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Briefly, corneal neovascularization as a result of injury to the anterior segment is a significant cause of decreased visual acuity and blindness, and a major risk factor for rejection of corneal allografts. As described by Burger et al., <highlight><italic>Lab. Invest. </italic></highlight>48:169-180, 1983, corneal angiogenesis involves three phases: a pre-vascular latent period, active neovascularization, and vascular maturation and regression. The identity and mechanism of various angiogenic factors, including elements of the inflammatory response, such as leukocytes, platelets, cytokines, and eicosanoids, or unidentified plasma constituents have yet to be revealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Currently no clinically satisfactory therapy exists for inhibition of corneal neovascularization or regression of existing corneal new vessels. Topical corticosteroids appear to have some clinical utility, presumably by limiting stromal inflammation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Thus, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating neovascular diseases of the eye such as corneal neovascularization (including corneal graft neovascularization), comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic composition (as described above) to the cornea, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. Briefly, the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however, capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized, it also becomes clouded, resulting in a decline in the patient&apos;s visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Blood vessels can enter the cornea in a variety of patterns and depths, depending upon the process which incites the neovascularization. These patterns have been traditionally defined by ophthalmologists in the following types: pannus trachomatosus, pannus leprosus, pannus phylctenulosus, pannus degenerativus, and glaucomatous pannus. The corneal stroma may also be invaded by branches of the anterior ciliary artery (called interstitial vascularization) which causes several distinct clinical lesions: terminal loops, a &ldquo;brush-like&rdquo; pattern, an umbel form, a lattice form, interstitial arcades (from episcleral vessels), and aberrant irregular vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of disorders can result in corneal neovascularization, including for example, corneal infections (e.g., trachoma, herpes simplex keratitis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis), immunological processes (e.g., graft rejection and Stevens-Johnson&apos;s syndrome), alkali burns, trauma, inflammation (of any cause), toxic and nutritional deficiency states, and as a complication of wearing contact lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> While the cause of corneal neovascularization may vary, the response of the cornea to the insult and the subsequent vascular ingrowth is similar regardless of the cause. Briefly, the location of the injury appears to be of importance as only those lesions situated within a critical distance of the limbus will incite an angiogenic response. This is likely due to the fact that the angiogenic factors responsible for eliciting the vascular invasion are created at the site of the lesion, and must diffuse to the site of the nearest blood vessels (the limbus) in order to exert their effect. Past a certain distance from the limbus, this would no longer be possible and the limbic endothelium would not be induced to grow into the cornea. Several angiogenic factors are likely involved in this process, many of which are products of the inflammatory response. Indeed, neovascularization of the cornea appears to only occur in association with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, and the degree of angiogenesis is proportional to the extent of the inflammatory reaction. Corneal edema further facilitates blood vessel ingrowth by loosening the corneal stromal framework and providing a pathway of &ldquo;least resistance&rdquo; through which the capillaries can grow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Following the initial inflammatory reaction, capillary growth into the cornea proceeds in the same manner as it occurs in other tissues. The normally quiescent endothelial cells of the limbic capillaries and venules are stimulated to divide and migrate. The endothelial cells project away from their vessels of origin, digest the surrounding basement membrane and the tissue through which they will travel, and migrate towards the source of the angiogenic stimulus. The blind ended sprouts acquire a lumen and then anastomose together to form capillary loops. The end result is the establishment of a vascular plexus within the corneal stroma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Anti-angiogenic factors and compositions of the present invention are useful by blocking the stimulatory effects of angiogenesis promoters, reducing endothelial cell division, decreasing endothelial cell migration, and impairing the activity of the proteolytic enzymes secreted by the endothelium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, an anti-angiogenic factor may be prepared for topical administration in saline (combined with any of the preservatives and antimicrobial agents commonly used in ocular preparations), and administered in eyedrop form. The anti-angiogenic factor solution or suspension may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively, anti-angiogenic compositions, prepared as described above, may also be administered directly to the cornea. Within preferred embodiments, the anti-angiogenic composition is prepared with a muco-adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. Within further embodiments, the anti-angiogenic factors or anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response (such as chemical burns). In these instances the treatment, likely in combination with steroids, may be instituted immediately to help prevent subsequent complications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Within other embodiments, the anti-angiogenic compositions described above may be injected directly into the corneal stroma by an ophthalmologist under microscopic guidance. The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion, but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature (i.e., interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea). In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained-release form injections might only be required 2-3 times per year. A steroid could also be added to the injection solution to reduce inflammation resulting from the injection itself Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating neovascular glaucoma, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic composition to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Briefly, neovascular glaucoma is a pathological condition wherein new capillaries develop in the iris of the eye. The angiogenesis usually originates from vessels located at the pupillary margin, and progresses across the root of the iris and into the trabecular meshwork. Fibroblasts and other connective tissue elements are associated with the capillary growth and a fibrovascular membrane develops which spreads across the anterior surface of the iris. Eventually this tissue reaches the anterior chamber angle where it forms synechiae. These synechiae in turn coalesce, scar, and contract to ultimately close off the anterior chamber angle. The scar formation prevents adequate drainage of aqueous humor through the angle and into the trabecular meshwork, resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure that may result in blindness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Neovascular glaucoma generally occurs as a complication of diseases in which retinal ischemia is predominant. In particular, about one third of the patients with this disorder have diabetic retinopathy and 28% have central retinal vein occlusion. Other causes include chronic retinal detachment, end-stage glaucoma, carotid artery obstructive disease, retrolental fibroplasia, sickle-cell anemia, intraocular tumors, and carotid cavernous fistulas. In its early stages, neovascular glaucoma may be diagnosed by high magnification slitlamp biomicroscopy, where it reveals small, dilated, disorganized capillaries (which leak fluorescein) on the surface of the iris. Later gonioscopy demonstrates progressive obliteration of the anterior chamber angle by fibrovascular bands. While the anterior chamber angle is still open, conservative therapies may be of assistance. However, once the angle closes surgical intervention is required in order to alleviate the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Therefore, within one embodiment of the invention anti-angiogenic factors (either alone or in an anti-angiogenic composition, as described above) may be administered topically to the eye in order to treat early forms of neovascular glaucoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Within other embodiments of the invention, anti-angiogenic compositions may be implanted by injection of the composition into the region of the anterior chamber angle. This provides a sustained localized increase of anti-angiogenic factor, and prevents blood vessel growth into the area. Implanted or injected anti-angiogenic compositions which are placed between the advancing capillaries of the iris and the anterior chamber angle can &ldquo;defend&rdquo; the open angle from neovascularization. As capillaries will not grow within a significant radius of the anti-angiogenic composition, patency of the angle could be maintained. Within other embodiments, the anti-angiogenic composition may also be placed in any location such that the anti-angiogenic factor is continuously released into the aqueous humor. This would increase the anti-angiogenic factor concentration within the humor, which in turn bathes the surface of the iris and its abnormal capillaries, thereby providing another mechanism by which to deliver the medication. These therapeutic modalities may also be useful prophylactically and in combination with existing treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic composition to the eyes, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the pathology of diabetic retinopathy is thought to be similar to that described above for neovascular glaucoma. In particular, background diabetic retinopathy is believed to convert to proliferative diabetic retinopathy under the influence of retinal hypoxia. Generally, neovascular tissue sprouts from the optic nerve (usually within 10 mm of the edge), and from the surface of the retina in regions where tissue perfusion is poor. Initially the capillaries grow between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the posterior surface of the vitreous. Eventually, the vessels grow into the vitreous and through the inner limiting membrane. As the vitreous contracts, traction is applied to the vessels, often resulting in shearing of the vessels and blinding of the vitreous due to hemorrhage. Fibrous traction from scarring in the retina may also produce retinal detachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The conventional therapy of choice is panretinal photocoagulation to decrease retinal tissue, and thereby decrease retinal oxygen demands. Although initially effective, there is a high relapse rate with new lesions forming in other parts of the retina. Complications of this therapy include a decrease in peripheral vision of up to 50% of patients, mechanical abrasions of the cornea, laser-induced cataract formation, acute glaucoma, and stimulation of subretinal neovascular growth (which can result in loss of vision). As a result, this procedure is performed only when several risk factors are present, and the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favor of intervention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Therefore, within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be treated by injection of an anti-angiogenic factor(s) (or anti-angiogenic composition) into the aqueous humor or the vitreous, in order to increase the local concentration of anti-angiogenic factor in the retina. Preferably, this treatment should be initiated prior to the acquisition of severe disease requiring photocoagulation. Within other embodiments of the invention, arteries which feed the neovascular lesions may be embolized (utilizing anti-angiogenic compositions, as described above) Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating retrolental fibroblasia, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-angiogenic factor (or anti-angiogenic composition) to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Briefly, retrolental fibroblasia is a condition occurring in premature infants who receive oxygen therapy. The peripheral retinal vasculature, particularly on the temporal side, does not become fully formed until the end of fetal life. Excessive oxygen (even levels which would be physiologic at term) and the formation of oxygen free radicals are thought to be important by causing damage to the blood vessels of the immature retina. These vessels constrict, and then become structurally obliterated on exposure to oxygen. As a result, the peripheral retina fails to vascularize and retinal ischemia ensues. In response to the ischemia, neovascularization is induced at the junction of the normal and the ischemic retina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In 75% of the cases these vessels regress spontaneously. However, in the remaining 25% there is continued capillary growth, contraction of the fibrovascular component, and traction on both the vessels and the retina. This results in vitreous hemorrhage and/or retinal detachment which can lead to blindness. Neovascular angle-closure glaucoma is also a complication of this condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> As it is often impossible to determine which cases will spontaneously resolve and which will progress in severity, conventional treatment (i.e., surgery) is generally initiated only in patients with established disease and a well developed pathology. This &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach precludes early intervention, and allows the progression of disease in the 25% who follow a complicated course. Therefore, within one embodiment of the invention, topical administration of anti-angiogenic factors (or anti-angiogenic compositions, as described above) may be accomplished in infants which are at high risk for developing this condition in an attempt to cut down on the incidence of progression of retrolental fibroplasia. Within other embodiments, intravitreous injections and/or intraocular implants of an anti-angiogenic composition may be utilized. Such methods are particularly preferred in cases of established disease, in order to reduce the need for surgery. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Other Therapeutic Uses of Anti-Angiogenic Compositions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Anti-angiogenic factors and compositions of the present invention may be utilized in a variety of additional methods in order to therapeutically treat a cancer or tumor. For example, anti-angiogenic factors or compositions described herein may be formulated for topical delivery, in order to treat cancers such as skin cancer, head and neck tumors, breast tumors, and Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma. Within yet other aspects, the anti-angiogenic factors or compositions provided herein may be utilized to treat superficial forms of bladder cancer by, for example, intravesical administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In addition to cancer, however, numerous other non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent diseases which are characterized by the abnormal growth of blood vessels may also be treated with the anti-angiogenic factors or compositions of the present invention. Representative examples of such non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent diseases include hypertrophic scars and keloids, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (discussed above), rheumatoid arthritis (discussed above), arteriovenous malformations (discussed above), atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, hemophilic joints, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, psoriasis, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, tracoma, menorrhagia (discussed above) and vascular adhesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> For example, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids, comprising the step of administering one of the above-described anti-angiogenic compositions to a hypertrophic scar or keloid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Briefly, healing of wounds and scar formation occurs in three phases: inflammation, proliferation, and maturation. The first phase, inflammation, occurs in response to an injury which is severe enough to break the skin. During this phase, which lasts 3 to 4 days, blood and tissue fluid form an adhesive coagulum and fibrinous network which serves to bind the wound surfaces together. This is then followed by a proliferative phase in which there is ingrowth of capillaries and connective tissue from the wound edges, and closure of the skin defect. Finally, once capillary and fibroblastic proliferation has ceased, the maturation process begins wherein the scar contracts and becomes less cellular, less vascular, and appears flat and white. This final phase may take between 6 and 12 months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> If too much connective tissue is produced and the wound remains persistently cellular, the scar may become red and raised. If the scar remains within the boundaries of the original wound it is referred to as a hypertrophic scar, but if it extends beyond the original scar and into the surrounding tissue, the lesion is referred to as a keloid. Hypertrophic scars and keloids are produced during the second and third phases of scar formation. Several wounds are particularly prone to excessive endothelial and fibroblastic proliferation, including burns, open wounds, and infected wounds. With hypertrophic scars, some degree of maturation occurs and gradual improvement occurs. In the case of keloids however, an actual tumor is produced which can become quite large. Spontaneous improvement in such cases rarely occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Therefore, within one embodiment of the present invention either anti-angiogenic factors alone, or anti-angiogenic compositions as described above, are directly injected into a hypertrophic scar or keloid, in order to prevent the progression of these lesions. The frequency of injections will depend upon the release kinetics of the polymer used (if present), and the clinical response. This therapy is of particular value in the prophylactic treatment of conditions which are known to result in the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids (e.g., burns), and is preferably initiated after the proliferative phase has had time to progress (approximately 14 days after the initial injury), but before hypertrophic scar or keloid development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> As noted above, within yet another aspect of the present invention, vascular grafts are provided comprising a synthetic tube, the surface of which is coated with an anti-angiogenic composition as described above. Briefly, vascular grafts are synthetic tubes, usually made of Dacron or Gortex, inserted surgically to bypass arterial blockages, most frequently from the aorta to the femoral, or the femoral to the popliteal artery. A major problem which particularly complicates femoral-popliteal bypass grafts is the formation of a subendothelial scar-like reaction in the blood vessel wall called neointimal hyperplasia, which narrows the lumen within and adjacent to either end of the graft, and which can be progressive. A graft coated with or containing anti-angiogenic factors (or anti-angiogenic compositions, as described above) may be utilized to limit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia at either end of the graft. The graft may then be surgically placed by conventional bypass techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may also be utilized in a variety of other manners. For example, they may be incorporated into surgical sutures in order to prevent stitch granulomas, implanted in the uterus (in the same manner as an IUD) for the treatment of menorrhagia or as a form of female birth control, administered as either a peritoneal lavage fluid or for peritoneal implantation in the treatment of endometriosis, attached to a monoclonal antibody directed against activated endothelial cells as a form of systemic chemotherapy, or utilized in diagnostic imaging when attached to a radioactively labeled monoclonal antibody which recognizes activated endothelial cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Formulation and Administration </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> As noted above, anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a variety of forms (e.g., microspheres, pastes, films or sprays). Further, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated to contain more than one anti-angiogenic factor, to contain a variety of additional compounds, to have certain physical properties (e.g., elasticity, a particular melting point, or a specified release rate). Within certain embodiments of the invention, compositions may be combined in order to achieve a desired effect (e.g., several preparations of microspheres may be combined in order to achieve both a quick and a slow or prolonged release of one or more anti-angiogenic factor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Anti-angiogenic factors and compositions of the present invention may be administered either alone, or in combination with pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier, excipients or diluents. Generally, such carriers should be nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Ordinarily, the preparation of such compositions entails combining the therapeutic agent with buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including glucose, sucrose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other stabilizers and excipients. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with nonspecific serum albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> As noted above, anti-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic compositions, or pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be prepared for administration by a variety of different routes, including for example intrarticularly, intraocularly, intranasally, intradermally, sublingually, orally, topically, intravesically, intrathecally, topically, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intracranially, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or even directly into a tumor or disease site. Other representative routes of administration include gastroscopy, ECRP and colonoscopy, which do not require full operating procedures and hospitalization, but may require the presence of medical personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The anti-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic compositions and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be placed within containers, along with packaging material which provides instructions regarding the use of such materials. Generally, such instructions will include a tangible expression describing the reagent concentration, as well as within certain embodiments, relative amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents (e.g., water, saline or PBS) which may be necessary to reconstitute the anti-angiogenic factor, anti-angiogenic composition, or pharmaceutical composition. </paragraph>

The cartilage is then homogenized with a tissue grinder, and extracted by continuous stirring at room temperature for 2 to 5 days in a solution containing 2.0 M guanidium hydrochloride and 0.02 M MES at pH 6.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> After 2 to 5 days, the cartilage extract is passed through gauze netting in order to remove the larger constituents. The filtrate is then passed through an Amicon ultrafiltration unit which utilizes spiral-wound cartridges, with a molecular weight cutoff of 100,000. The filtrate (containing proteins with a molecular weight of less than 100,000 daltons) is then dialyzed against 0.02 M MES buffer (pH 6) with an Amicon ultrafiltration unit which retains proteins with a molecular weight of greater than 3,000 daltons. Utilizing this method, low molecular weight proteins and constituents are removed, as well as excessive amounts of guanidium HCl. The dialysate is concentrated to a final concentration 9 mg/ml. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Fertilized, domestic chick embryos were incubated for 3 days prior to shell-less culturing. In this procedure, the egg contents were emptied by removing the shell located around the air space. The interior shell membrane was then severed and the opposite end of the shell was perforated to allow the contents of the egg to gently slide out from the blunted end. The egg contents were emptied into round-bottom sterilized glass bowls and covered with petri dish covers. These were then placed into an incubator at 90% relative humidity and 3% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and incubated for 3 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel (Sigma, St. Louis, Mich.) was mixed at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 30 &mgr;g per 10 ml aliquot of 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose. Since paclitaxel is insoluble in water, glass beads were used to produce fine particles. Ten microliter aliquots of this solution were dried on parafilm for 1 hour forming disks 2 mm in diameter. The dried disks containing paclitaxel were then carefully placed at the growing edge of each CAM at day 6 of incubation. Controls were obtained by placing paclitaxel-free methylcellulose disks on the CAMs over the same time course. After a 2 day exposure (day 8 of incubation) the vasculature was examined with the aid of a stereomicroscope. Liposyn II, a white opaque solution, was injected into the CAM to increase the visibility of the vascular details. The vasculature of unstained, living embryos were imaged using a Zeiss stereomicroscope which was interfaced with a video camera (Dage-MTI Inc., Michigan City, Ind.). These video signals were then displayed at 160 times magnification and captured using an image analysis system (Vidas, Kontron; Etching, Germany). Image negatives were then made on a graphics recorder (Model 3000; Matrix Instruments, Orangeburg, N.Y.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The membranes of the 8 day-old shell-less embryo were flooded with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer; additional fixative was injected under the CAM. After 10 minutes in situ, the CAM was removed and placed into fresh fixative for 2 hours at room temperature. The tissue was then washed overnight in cacodylate buffer containing 6% sucrose. The areas of interest were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 hours at 4&deg; C. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols, solvent exchanged with propylene oxide, and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife, placed on copper grids, stained, and examined in a Joel 1200EX electron microscope. Similarly, 0.5 mm sections were cut and stained with toluene blue for light microscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> At day 11 of development, chick embryos were used for the corrosion casting technique. Mercox resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, Calif.) was injected into the CAM vasculature using a 30-gauge hypodermic needle. The casting material consisted of 2.5 grams of Mercox CL-2B polymer and 0.05 grams of catalyst (55% benzoyl peroxide) having a 5 minute polymerization time. After injection, the plastic was allowed to sit in situ for an hour at room temperature and then overnight in an oven at 65&deg; C. The CAM was then placed in 50% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to digest all organic components. The plastic casts were washed extensively in distilled water, air-dried, coated with gold/palladium, and viewed with the Philips 501B scanning electron microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Results of the above experiments are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Briefly, the general features of the normal chick shell-less egg culture are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. At day 6 of incubation, the embryo is centrally positioned to a radially expanding network of blood vessels; the CAM develops adjacent to the embryo. These growing vessels lie close to the surface and are readily visible malting this system an idealized model for the study of angiogenesis. Living, unstained capillary networks of the CAM can be imaged noninvasively with a stereomicroscope. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates such a vascular area in which the cellular blood elements within capillaries were recorded with the use of a video/computer interface. The 3-dimensional architecture of such CAM capillary networks is shown by the corrosion casting method and viewed in the scanning electron microscope (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). These castings revealed underlying vessels which project toward the CAM surface where they form a single layer of anastomotic capillaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Transverse sections through the CAM show an outer ectoderm consisting of a double cell layer, a broader mesodermal layer containing capillaries which lie subjacent to the ectoderm, adventitial cells, and an inner, single endodermal cell layer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>). At the electron microscopic level, the typical structural details of the CAM capillaries are demonstrated. Typically, these vessels lie in close association with the inner cell layer of ectoderm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference>) After 48 hours exposure to paclitaxel at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, or 30 ug, each CAM was examined under living conditions with a stereomicroscope equipped with a video/computer interface in order to evaluate the effects on angiogenesis. This imaging setup was used at a magnification of 160 times which permitted the direct visualization of blood cells within the capillaries; thereby blood flow in areas of interest could be easily assessed and recorded. For this study, the inhibition of angiogenesis was defined as an area of the CAM lacking a capillary network and vascular blood flow. Throughout the experiments, avascular zones were assessed on a 4 point avascular gradient (Table I). This scale represents the degree of overall inhibition with maximal inhibition represented as a 3 on the avascular gradient scale. Paclitaxel was very consistent and induced a maximal avascular zone (6 mm in diameter or a 3 on the avasculare gradient scale) within 48 hours depending on its concentration.

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Typical paclitaxel-treated CAMs are also shown with the transparent methylcellulose disk centrally positioned over the avascular zone measuring 6 mm in diameter. At a slightly higher magnification, the periphery of such avascular zones is clearly evident (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C); the surrounding functional vessels were often redirected away from the source of paclitaxel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</cross-reference>). Such angular redirecting of blood flow was never observed under normal conditions. Another feature of the effects of paclitaxel was the formation of blood islands within the avascular zone representing the aggregation of blood cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The associated morphological alterations of the paclitaxel-treated CAM are readily apparent at both the light and electron microscopic levels. For the convenience of presentation, three distinct phases of general transition from the normal to the avascular state are shown. Near the periphery of the avascular zone the CAM is hallmarked by an abundance of mitotic cells within all three germ layers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</cross-reference>). This enhanced mitotic division was also a consistent observation for capillary endothelial cells. However, the endothelial cells remained junctionally intact with no extravasation of blood cells. With further degradation, the CAM is characterized by the breakdown and dissolution of capillaries (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4B</cross-reference>). The presumptive endothelial cells, typically arrested in mitosis, still maintain a close spatial relationship with blood cells and lie subjacent to the ectoderm; however, these cells are not junctionally linked. The most central portion of the avascular zone was characterized by a thickened ectodermal and endodermal layer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 4C</cross-reference>). Although these layers were thickened, the cellular junctions remained intact and the layers maintained their structural characteristics. Within the mesoderm, scattered mitotically arrested cells were abundant; these cells did not exhibit the endothelial cell polarization observed in the former phase. Also, throughout this avascular region, degenerating cells were common as noted by the electron dense vacuoles and cellular debris (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> In summary, this study demonstrated that 48 hours after paclitaxel application to the CAM, angiogenesis was inhibited. The blood vessel inhibition formed an avascular zone which was represented by three transitional phases of paclitaxel&apos;s effect. The central, most affected area of the avascular zone contained disrupted capillaries with extravasated red blood cells; this indicated that intercellular junctions between endothelial cells were absent. The cells of the endoderm and ectoderm maintained their intercellular junctions and therefore these germ layers remained intact; however, they were slightly thickened. As the normal vascular area was approached, the blood vessels retained their junctional complexes and therefore also remained intact. At the periphery of the paclitaxel-treated zone, further blood vessel growth was inhibited which was evident by the typical redirecting or &ldquo;elbowing&rdquo; effect of the blood vessels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel-treated avascular zones also revealed an abundance of cells arrested in mitosis in all three germ layers of the CAM; this was unique to paclitaxel since no previous study has illustrated such an event. By being arrested in mitosis, endothelial cells could not undergo their normal metabolic functions involved in angiogenesis. In comparison, the avascular zone formed by suramin and cortisone acetate do not produce mitotically arrested cells in the CAM; they only prevented further blood vessel growth into the treated area. Therefore, even though these agents are anti-angiogenic, there are many points in which the angiogenesis process may be targeted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The effects of paclitaxel over the 48 hour duration were also observed. During this period of observation it was noticed that inhibition of angiogenesis occurs as early as 9 hours after application. Histological sections revealed a similar morphology as seen in the first transition phase of the avascular zone at 48 hours illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</cross-reference>. Also, we observed in the revascularization process into the avascular zone previously observed. It has been found that the avascular zone formed by heparin and angiostatic steroids became revascularized 60 hours after application. In one study, paclitaxel-treated avascular zones did not revascularize for at least 7 days after application implying a more potent long-term effect. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> One milliliter of 5% ELVAX (poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) cross-linked with 5% vinyl acetate) in dichloromethane (&ldquo;DCM&rdquo;) is mixed with a fixed weight of sub-micron ground sodium suramin. This mixture is injected into 5 ml of 5% Polyvinyl Alcohol (&ldquo;PVA&rdquo;) in water in a 30 ml flat bottomed test tube. Tubes containing different weights of the drug are then suspended in a multi-sample water bath at 40&deg; for 90 minutes with automated stirring. The mixtures are removed, and microsphere samples taken for size analysis. Tubes are centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. The PVA supernatant is removed and saved for analysis (nonencapsulated drug). The microspheres are then washed (vortexed) in 5 ml of water and recentrifuged. The 5 ml wash is saved for analysis (surface bound drug). Microspheres are then wetted in 50 ul of methanol, and vortexed in 1 ml of DCM to dissolve the ELVAX. The microspheres are then warmed to 40&deg; C., and 5 ml of 50&deg; C. water is slowly added with stirring. This procedure results in the immediate evaporation of DCM, thereby causing the release of sodium suramin into the 5 ml of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> All samples were assayed for drug content by quantification of fluorescence. Briefly, sodium suramin absorbs uv/vis with a lambda max of 312 nm. This absorption is linear in the 0 to 100 ug/ml range in both water and 5% PVA. Sodium suramin also fluoresces strongly with an excitation maximum at 312 nm, and emission maximum at 400 nm. This fluorescence is quantifiable in the 0 to 25 ug/ml range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The results of these experiments is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Results are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Briefly, the size distribution of microspheres by number (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) or by weight (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) appears to be unaffected by inclusion of the drug in the DCM. Good yields of microspheres in the 20 to 60 &mgr;m range may be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation of suramin is very low (&lt;1%) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). However as the weight of drug is increased in the DCM the total amount of drug encapsulated increased although the % encapsulation decreased. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, </cross-reference>50 ug of drug may be encapsulated in 50 mg of ELVAX. Encapsulation of sodium suramin in 2.5% PVA containing 10% NaCl is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (size distribution by weight). Encapsulation of sodium suramin in 5% PVA containing 10% NaCl is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> (size distribution by weight, and number, respectively). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> To assess suramin and cortisone acetate as potential anti-angiogenic agents, each agent was mixed with 0.5% methylcellulose and applied the dried disks containing the agent onto the developing blood vessels of the 6-day old CAM. A combination treatment of suramin (70 &mgr;g) with cortisone acetate (20 g) was successful in inhibiting angiogenesis when tested on the CAM for 48 hours. The resulting avascular region measured 6 mm in diameter and revealed an absence of blood flow and the appearance of sparse blood islands (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Encapsulation of Paclitaxel </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Five hundred micrograms of either paclitaxel or baccatin (a paclitaxel analog, available from Inflazyme Pharmaceuticals Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) are dissolved in 1 ml of a 50:50 ELVAX:poly-1-lactic acid mixture in dcm. Microspheres are then prepared in a dissolution machine (Six-spindle dissolution tester, VanderKanp, Van Kell Industries Inc., U.S.A.) in triplicate at 200 rpm, 42&deg; C., for 3 hours. Microspheres so prepared are washed twice in water and sized on the microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Determination of paclitaxel encapsulation is undertaken in a uv/vis assay (uv/vis lambda max. at 237 nm, fluorescence assay at excitation 237, emission at 325 nm; Fluorescence results are presented in square brackets &lsqb;&rsqb;). Utilizing the procedures described above, 58 &mgr;g (&plus;/&minus;12 &mgr;g) &lsqb;75 &mgr;g (&plus;/&minus;25 &mgr;g)&rsqb; of paclitaxel may be encapsulated from a total 500 &mgr;g of starting material.

<heading lvl="1">Embolization of Rat Arteries </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Fisher rats weighing approximately 300 grams are anesthetized. Utilizing aseptic procedures, a 1 cm transverse upper abdominal incision is made, and the liver identified. Two-tenths of a milliliter of saline containing 1 million live 9L gliosarcoma cells (eluted immediately prior from tissue culture) is injected into each of the 5 hepatic lobes by piercing a 27 gauge needle 1 cm through the liver capsule. One-tenth of a milliliter of normal saline is injected into the needle as it is withdrawn to ensure that there is no spillage of cells into the peritoneal cavity. A pledget of gelfoam is placed on each of the puncture sites to ensure hemostasis. The abdominal wound is closed with 6.0 resorptible suture with skin clips, and the anesthetic terminated. The rat is returned to the animal care facility to have a standard diet for 14 days, at which time each tumor deposit will measure 1 cm in diameter. The same procedure is repeated using Westar rats and a Colon Cancer cell line (Radiologic Oncology Lab, M. D. Anderson, Houston, Tex.). In this instance, 3 weeks are required post-injection for the tumor deposits to measure 1 cm in diameter each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> After 2 or 3 weeks, depending on the rat species, the same general anesthetic procedure is followed and a midline abdominal incision is performed. The duodenum is flipped and the gastroduodenal artery is identified and mobilized. Ties are placed above and below a cutdown site on the midportion of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and 0.038 inch polyethylene tubing is introduced in a retrograde fashion into the artery using an operating microscope. The tie below the insertion point will ligate the artery, while the one above will fix the catheter in place. Angiography is performed by injecting 0.5 ml of 60% radiopaque contrast material through the catheter as an x-ray is taken. The hepatic artery is then embolized by refluxing particles measuring 15-200 &mgr;m through the gastroduodenal artery catheter until flow, observed via the operating microscope, is seen to cease for at least 30 seconds. Occlusion of the hepatic artery is confirmed by repeating an angiogram through the GDA catheter. Utilizing this procedure, one-half of the rats receive 15-200 &mgr;m particles of polymer alone, and the other half receive 15-200 &mgr;m particles of the polymer-anti-angiogenic factor composition. The upper GDA ligature is tightened to occlude the GDA as the catheter is withdrawn to ensure hemostasis, and the hepatic artery (although embolized) is left intact. The abdomen is closed with 6.0 absorbable suture and surgical clips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The rats are subsequently sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 21 and 84 days post-embolization in order to determine efficacy of the anti-angiogenic factor. Briefly, general anesthetic is given, and utilizing aseptic precautions, a midline incision performed. The GDA is mobilized again, and after placing a ligature near the junction of the GDA and the hepatic artery (i.e., well above the site of the previous cutdown), a 0.038-inch polyethylene tubing is inserted via cutdown of the vessel and angiography is performed. The rat is then euthanized by injecting Euthanyl into the dorsal vein of the tail. Once euthanasia is confirmed, the liver is removed en bloc along with the stomach, spleen and both lungs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Histologic analysis is performed on a prepared slide stained with hematoxylin and eosin (&ldquo;H and E&rdquo;) stain. Briefly, the lungs are sectioned at 1 cm intervals to assess passage of embolic material through the hepatic veins and into the right side of circulation. The stomach and spleen are also sectioned in order to assess inadvertent immobilization from reflux of particles into the celiac access of the collateral circulation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> General anesthetic is administered to 300 gram Fisher rats. A 1 cm transverse incision is then made in the upper abdomen, and the liver identified. In the most superficial lobe, 0.2 ml of saline containing 1 million cells of 9L gliosarcoma cells (eluted from tissue culture immediately prior to use) is injected via a 27 gauge needle to a depth of 1 cm into the liver capsule. Hemostasis is achieved after removal of the needle by placing a pledget of gelfoam at the puncture sites. Saline is injected as the needle is removed to ensure no spillage of cells into the peritoneal cavity or along the needle track. The general anesthetic is terminated, and the animal returned to the animal care center and placed on a normal diet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Two weeks later, general anesthetic is administered, and utilizing aseptic precautions, the hepatic lobe containing the tumor is identified through a midline incision. A 16 gauge angiographic needle is then inserted through the hepatic capsule into the tumor, a 0.038-inch guidewire passed through the needle, and the needle withdrawn over the guidewire. A number 5 French dilator is passed over the guide into the tumor and withdrawn. A number 5 French delivery catheter is then passed over the wire containing a self-expanding stainless steel Wallstent (5 mm in diameter and 1 cm long). The stent is deployed into the tumor and the guidewire delivery catheter is removed. One-third of the rats have a conventional stainless steel stent inserted into the tumor, one-third a stainless steel stent coated with polymer, and one third a stent coated with the polymer-anti-angiogenic factor compound. The general anesthetic is terminated and the rat returned to the animal care facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> A plain abdominal X-ray is performed at 2 days in order to assess the degree of stent opening. Rats are sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days post-stent insertion by injecting Euthanyl, and their livers removed en bloc once euthanasia is confirmed. After fixation in formaldehyde for 48 hours, the liver is sectioned at 0.5 mm intervals; including severing the stent transversely using a fresh blade for each slice. Histologic sections stained with H and E are then analyzed to assess the degree of tumor ingrowth into the stent lumen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Depending on the polymer solution being prepared, 1.00 g of PCL or PLA, or 0.50 g each of PLA and washed EVA is weighed directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial. Twenty milliliters of DCM is then added, and the vial tightly capped. The vial is stored at room temperature (25&deg; C.) for one hour (occasional shaking may be used), or until all the polymer has dissolved (the solution should be clear). The solution may be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Twenty-five grams of PVA is weighed directly into a 600 ml glass beaker. Five hundred milliliters of distilled water is added, along with a 3 inch Teflon coated stir bar. The beaker is covered with glass to decrease evaporation losses, and placed into a 2000 ml glass beaker containing 300 ml of water (which acts as a water bath). The PVA is stirred at 300 rpm at 85&deg; C. (Corning hot plate/stirrer) for 2 hours or until fully dissolved. Dissolution of the PVA may be determined by a visual check; the solution should be clear. The solution is then transferred to a glass screw top storage container and stored at 4&deg; C. for a maximum of two months. The solution, however should be warmed to room temperature before use or dilution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> C. Procedure for Producing Microspheres </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Based on the size of microspheres being made (see Table 1), 100 ml of the PVA solution (concentrations given in Table IV) is placed into the 200 ml water jacketed beaker. Haake circulating water bath is connected to this beaker and the contents are allowed to equilibrate at 27&deg; C. (&plus;/&minus;10&deg; C.) for 10 minutes. Based on the size of microspheres being made (see Table IV), the start speed of the overhead stirrer is set, and the blade of the overhead stirrer placed half way down in the PVA solution. The stirrer is then started, and 10 ml of polymer solution (polymer solution used based on type of microspheres being produced) is then dripped into the stirring PVA over a period of 2 minutes using a 5 ml automatic pipetter. After 3 minutes the stir speed is adjusted (see Table IV), and the solution stirred for an additional 2.5 hours. The stirring blade is then removed from the microsphere preparation, and rinsed with 10 ml of distilled water so that the rinse solution drains into the microsphere preparation. The microsphere preparation is then poured into a 500 ml beaker, and the jacketed water bath washed with 70 ml of distilled water, which is also allowed to drain into the microsphere preparation. The 180 ml microsphere preparation is then stirred with a glass rod, and equal amounts are poured into four polypropylene 50 ml centrifuge tubes. The tubes are then capped, and centrifuged for 10 minutes (force given in Table III). A 5 ml automatic pipetter or vacuum suction is then utilized to draw 45 ml of the PVA solution off of each microsphere pellet.

The four microsphere suspensions are then pooled into one centrifuge tube along with 20 ml of distilled water, and centrifuged for another 10 minutes (force given in Table 1). This process is repeated two additional times for a total of three washes. The microspheres are then centrifuged a final time, and resuspended in 10 ml of distilled water. After the final wash, the microsphere preparation is transferred into a preweighed glass scintillation vial. The vial is capped, and left overnight at room temperature (25&deg; C.) in order to allow the microspheres to sediment out under gravity. Microspheres which fall in the size range of 0.1 um to 3 um do not sediment out under gravity, so they are left in the 10 ml suspension. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> After the microspheres have sat at room temperature overnight, a 5 ml automatic pipetter or vacuum suction is used to draw the supernatant off of the sedimented microspheres. The microspheres are allowed to dry in the uncapped vial in a drawer for a period of one week or until they are fully dry (vial at constant weight). Faster drying may be accomplished by leaving the uncapped vial under a slow stream of nitrogen gas (flow approx. 10 ml/min.) in the fume hood. When fully dry (vial at constant weight), the vial is weighed and capped. The labeled, capped vial is stored at room temperature in a drawer. Microspheres are normally stored no longer than 3 months. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> A. Procedure for Sprayed Stents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The following describes a typical method using a 3 mm crimped diameter interleaving metal wire stent of approximately 3 cm length. For larger diameter stents, larger volumes of polymer/drug solution are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Briefly, a sufficient quantity of polymer is weighed directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial, and sufficient DCM added in order to achieve a 2% w/v solution. The vial is then capped and mixed by hand in order to dissolve the polymer. The stent is then assembled in a vertical orientation, tying the stent to a retort stand with nylon. Position this stent holding apparatus 6 to 12 inches above the fume hood floor on a suitable support (e.g., inverted 2000 ml glass beaker) to enable horizontal spraying. Using an automatic pipette, a suitable volume (minimum 5 ml) of the 2% polymer solution is transferred to a separate 20 ml glass scintillation vial. An appropriate amount of paclitaxel is then added to the solution and dissolved by hand shaking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> To prepare for spraying, remove the cap of this vial and dip the barrel (only) of an TLC atomizer into the polymer solution. Note that the reservoir of the atomizer need not be used in this procedure: the 20 ml glass vial acts as a reservoir. Connect the nitrogen tank to the gas inlet of the atomizer. Gradually increase the pressure until atomization and spraying begins. Note the pressure and use this pressure throughout the procedure. To spray the stent use 5 second oscillating sprays with a 15 second dry time between sprays. After 5 sprays, rotate the stent 90&deg; and spray that portion of the stent. Repeat until all sides of the stent have been sprayed. During the dry time, finger crimp the gas line to avoid wastage of the spray. Spraying is continued until a suitable amount of polymer is deposited on the stents. The amount may be based on the specific stent application in vivo. To determine the amount, weigh the stent after spraying has been completed and the stent has dried. Subtract the original weight of the stent from the finished weight and this produces the amount of polymer (plus paclitaxel) applied to the stent. Store the coated stent in a sealed container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> B. Procedure for Dipped Stents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The following describes a typical method using a 3 mm crimped diameter interleaving metal wire stent of approximately 3 cm length. For larger diameter stents, larger volumes of polymer/drug solution are used in larger sized test tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Weigh 2 g of EVA into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and add 20 ml of DCM. Cap the vial and leave it for 2 hours to dissolve (hand shake the vial frequently to assist the dissolving process). Weigh a known weight of paclitaxel directly into a 1 ml glass test tube and add 0.5 ml of the polymer solution. Using a glass Pasteur pipette, dissolve the paclitaxel by gently pumping the polymer solution. Once the paclitaxel is dissolved, hold the test tube in a near horizontal position (the sticky polymer solution will not flow out). Using tweezers, insert the stent into the tube all the way to the bottom. Allow the polymer solution to flow almost to the mouth of the test tube by angling the mouth below horizontal and then restoring the test tube to an angle slightly above the horizontal. While slowly rotating the stent in the tube, slowly remove the stent (approximately 30 seconds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Hold the stent in a vertical position to dry. Some of the sealed perforations may pop so that a hole exists in the continuous sheet of polymer. This may be remedied by repeating the previous dipping procedure, however repetition of the procedure can also lead to further popping and a general uneven build up of polymer. Generally, it is better to dip the stent just once and to cut out a section of stent that has no popped perforations. Store the dipped stent in a sealed container. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Manufacture of Surgical &ldquo;Pastes&rdquo;</heading>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention provides a variety of polymeric-containing drug compositions that may be utilized within a variety of clinical situations. For example, compositions may be produced: (1) as a &ldquo;thermopaste&rdquo; that is applied to a desired site as a fluid, and hardens to a solid of the desired shape at a specified temperature (e.g., body temperature); (2) as a spray (i.e., &ldquo;nanospray&rdquo;) which may delivered to a desired site either directly or through a specialized apparatus (e.g., endoscopy), and which subsequently hardens to a solid which adheres to the tissue to which it is applied; (3) as an adherent, pliable, resilient, angiogeneis inhibitor-polymer film applied to a desired site either directly or through a specialized apparatus, and which preferably adheres to the site to which it is applied; and (4) as a fluid composed of a suspension of microspheres in an appropriate carrier medium, which is applied to a desired site either directly or via a specialized apparatus, and which leaves a layer of microspheres at the application site. Representative examples of each of the above embodiments is set forth in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> A. Procedure for Producing Thermopaste </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Reagents and equipment which are utilized within the following experiments include a sterile glass syringe (1 ml), Corning hot plate/stirrer, 20 ml glass scintillation vial, moulds (e.g., 50 &mgr;l DSC pan or 50 ml centrifuge tube cap inner portion), scalpel and tweezers, Polycaprolactone (&ldquo;PCL&rdquo;&mdash;mol wt 10,000 to 20,000; Polysciences, Warrington, Pa. USA), and Paclitaxel (Sigma grade 95% purity minimum). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Weigh 5.00 g of polycaprolactone directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial. Place the vial in a 600 ml beaker containing 50 ml of water. Gently heat the beaker to 65&deg; C. and hold it at that temperature for 20 minutes. This allows the polymer to melt. Thoroughly mix a known weight of paclitaxel, or other angiogenesis inhibitor into the melted polymer at 65&deg; C. Pour the melted polymer into a prewarmed (60&deg; C. oven) mould. Use a spatula to assist with the pouring process. Allow the mould to cool so the polymer solidifies. Cut or break the polymer into small pieces (approximately 2 mm by 2 mm in size). These pieces must fit into a 1 ml glass syringe. Remove the plunger from the 1 ml glass syringe (do not remove the cap from the tip) and place it on a balance. Zero the balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Weigh 0.5 g of the pieces directly into the open end of the syringe. Place the glass syringe upright (capped tip downwards) into a 500 ml glass beaker containing distilled water at 65&deg; C. (corning hot plate) so that no water enters the barrel. The polymer melts completely within 10 minutes in this apparatus. When the polymer pieces have melted, remove the barrel from the water bath, hold it horizontally and remove the cap. Insert the plunger into the barrel and compress the melted polymer into a sticky mass at the tip end of the barrel. Cap the syringe and allow it to cool to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> For application, the syringe may be reheated to 60&deg; C. and administered as a liquid which solidifies when cooled to body temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> B. Procedure for Producing Nanospray </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Nanospray is a suspension of small microspheres in saline. If the microspheres are very small (i.e., under 1 &mgr;m in diameter) they form a colloid so that the suspension will not sediment under gravity. As is described in more detail below, a suspension of 0.1 &mgr;m to 1 &mgr;m microparticles may be created suitable for deposition onto tissue through a finger pumped aerosol. Equipment and materials which may be utilized to produce nanospray include 200 ml water jacketed beaker (Kimax or Pyrex), Haake circulating water bath, overhead stirrer and controller with 2 inch diameter (4 blade, propeller type stainless steel stirrer; Fisher brand), 500 ml glass beaker, hot plate/stirrer (Corning brand), 4&times;50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes (Nalgene), glass scintillation vials with plastic insert caps, table top centrifuge (Beckman), high speed centrifuge&mdash;floor model (JS 21 Beckman), Mettler analytical balance (AJ 100, 0.1 mg), Mettler digital top loading balance (AE 163, 0.01 mg), automatic pipetter (Gilson), sterile pipette tips, pump action aerosol (Pfeiffer pharmaceuticals) 20 ml, laminar flow hood, Polycaprolactone (&ldquo;PCL&rdquo;&mdash;mol wt 10,000 to 20,000; Polysciences, Warrington, Pa. USA), &ldquo;washed&rdquo; (see previous) Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (&ldquo;EVA&rdquo;), Poly(DL)lactic acid (&ldquo;PLA&rdquo; mol wt 15,000 to 25,000; Polysciences), Polyvinyl Alcohol (&ldquo;PVA&rdquo;&mdash;mol wt 124,000 to 186,000; 99% hydrolyzed; Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. USA), Dichloromethane (&ldquo;DCM&rdquo; or &ldquo;methylene chloride;&rdquo; HPLC grade Fisher scientific), Distilled water, sterile saline (Becton and Dickenson or equivalent) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> 1. Preparation of 5% (w/v) Polymer Solutions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Depending on the polymer solution being prepared, weigh 1.00 g of PCL or PLA or 0.50 g each of PLA and washed EVA directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial. Using a measuring cylinder, add 20 ml of DCM and tightly cap the vial. Leave the vial at room temperature (25&deg; C.) for one hour or until all the polymer has dissolved (occasional hand shaking may be used). Dissolving of the polymer can be determined by a visual check; the solution should be clear. Label the vial with the name of the solution and the date it was produced. Store the solutions at room temperature and use within two weeks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> 2. Preparation of 3.5% (w/v) Stock Solution of PVA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The solution can be prepared by following the procedure given below, or by diluting the 5% (w/v) PVA stock solution prepared for production of microspheres (see Example 8). Briefly, 17.5 g of PVA is weighed directly into a 600 ml glass beaker, and 500 ml of distilled water is added. Place a 3 inch Teflon coated stir bar in the beaker. Cover the beaker with a cover glass to reduce evaporation losses. Place the beaker in a 2000 ml glass beaker containing 300 ml of water. This will act as a water bath. Stir the PVA at 300 rpm at 85&deg; C. (Coming hot plate/stirrer) for 2 hours or until fully dissolved. Dissolving of the PVA can be determined by a visual check; the solution should be clear. Use a pipette to transfer the solution to a glass screw top storage container and store at 4&deg; C. for a maximum of two months. This solution should be warmed to room temperature before use or dilution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> 3. Procedure for Producing Nanospray </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Place the stirring assembly in a fume hood. Place 100 ml of the 3.5% PVA solution in the 200 ml water jacketed beaker. Connect the Haake water bath to this beaker and allow the contents to equilibrate at 27&deg; C. (&plus;/&minus;1&deg; C.) for 10 minutes. Set the start speed of the overhead stirrer at 3000 rpm (&plus;/&minus;200 rpm). Place the blade of the overhead stirrer half way down in the PVA solution and start the stirrer. Drip 10 ml of polymer solution (polymer solution used based on type of nanospray being produced) into the stirring PVA over a period of 2 minutes using a 5 ml automatic pipetter. After 3 minutes, adjust the stir speed to 2500 rpm (&plus;/&minus;200 rpm) and leave the assembly for 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours, remove the stirring blade from the nanospray preparation and rinse with 10 ml of distilled water. Allow the rinse solution to go into the nanospray preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Pour the microsphere preparation into a 500 ml beaker. Wash the jacketed water bath with 70 ml of distilled water. Allow the 70 ml rinse solution to go into the microsphere preparation. Stir the 180 ml microsphere preparation with a glass rod and pour equal amounts of it into four polypropylene 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Cap the tubes. Centrifuge the capped tubes at 10000 g (&plus;/&minus;1000 g) for 10 minutes. Using a 5 ml automatic pipetter or vacuum suction, draw 45 ml of the PVA solution off of each microsphere pellet and discard it. Add 5 ml of distilled water to each centrifuge tube and use a vortex to resuspend the microspheres in each tube. Using 20 ml of distilled water, pool the four microsphere suspensions into one centrifuge tube. To wash the microspheres, centrifuge the nanospray preparation for 10 minutes at 10 000 g (&plus;/&minus;1000 g). Draw the supernatant off of the microsphere pellet. Add 40 ml of distilled water and use a vortex to resuspend the microspheres. Repeat this process two more times for a total of three washes. Do a fourth wash but use only 10 ml (not 40 ml) of distilled water when resuspending the microspheres. After the fourth wash, transfer the microsphere preparation into a preweighed glass scintillation vial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Cap the vial and let it to sit for 1 hour at room temperature (25&deg; C.) to allow the 2 &mgr;m and 3 &mgr;m diameter microspheres to sediment out under gravity. After 1 hour, draw off the top 9 ml of suspension using a 5 ml automatic pipetter. Place the 9 ml into a sterile capped 50 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the suspension at 10000 g (&plus;/&minus;1000 g) for 10 minutes. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 ml of sterile saline. Centrifuge the suspension at 10000 g (&plus;/&minus;1000 g) for 10 minutes. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in sterile saline. The quantity of saline used is dependent on the final required suspension concentration (usually 10% w/v). Thoroughly rinse the aerosol apparatus in sterile saline and add the nanospray suspension to the aerosol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> C. Manufacture of Paclitaxel Loaded Nanospray </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> To manufacture nanospray containing paclitaxel, use Paclitaxel (Sigma grade 95% purity). To prepare the polymer drug stock solution, weigh the appropriate amount of paclitaxel directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial. The appropriate amount is determined based on the percentage of paclitaxel to be in the nanospray. For example, if nanospray containing 5% paclitaxel was required, then the amount of paclitaxel weighed would be 25 mg since the amount of polymer added is 10 ml of a 5% polymer in DCM solution (see next step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Add 10 ml of the appropriate 5% polymer solution to the vial containing the paclitaxel. Cap the vial and vortex or hand swirl it to dissolve the paclitaxel (visual check to ensure paclitaxel dissolved). Label the vial with the date it was produced. This is to be used the day it is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Follow the procedures as described above, except that polymer/drug (e.g., paclitaxel) stock solution is substituted for the polymer solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> D. Procedure for Producing Film </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The term film refers to a polymer formed into one of many geometric shapes. The film may be a thin, elastic sheet of polymer or a 2 mm thick disc of polymer. This film is designed to be placed on exposed tissue so that any encapsulated drug is released from the polymer over a long period of time at the tissue site. Films may be made by several processes, including for example, by casting, and by spraying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> In the casting technique, polymer is either melted and poured into a shape or dissolved in dichloromethane and poured into a shape. The polymer then either solidifies as it cools or solidifies as the solvent evaporates, respectively. In the spraying technique, the polymer is dissolved in solvent and sprayed onto glass, as the solvent evaporates the polymer solidifies on the glass. Repeated spraying enables a build up of polymer into a film that can be peeled from the glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Reagents and equipment which were utilized within these experiments include a small beaker, Corning hot plate stirrer, casting moulds (e.g., 50 ml centrifuge tube caps) and mould holding apparatus, 20 ml glass scintillation vial with cap (Plastic insert type), TLC atomizer, Nitrogen gas tank, Polycaprolactone (&ldquo;PCL&rdquo;&mdash;mol wt 10,000 to 20,000; Polysciences), Paclitaxel (Sigma 95% purity), Ethanol, &ldquo;washed&rdquo; (see previous) Ethylene vinyl acetate (&ldquo;EVA&rdquo;), Poly(DL)lactic acid (&ldquo;PLA&rdquo;&mdash;mol wt 15,000 to 25,000; Polysciences), Dichloromethane (HPLC grade Fisher Scientific). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> 1. Procedure for Producing Films&mdash;Melt Casting </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Weigh a known weight of PCL directly into a small glass beaker. Place the beaker in a larger beaker containing water (to act as a water bath) and put it on the hot plate at 70&deg; C. for 15 minutes or until the polymer has fully melted. Add a known weight of drug to the melted polymer and stir the mixture thoroughly. To aid dispersion of the drug in the melted PCL, the drug may be suspended/dissolved in a small volume (&lt;10% of the volume of the melted PCL) of 100% ethanol. This ethanol suspension is then mixed into the melted polymer. Pour the melted polymer into a mould and let it to cool. After cooling, store the film in a container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> 2. Procedure for Producing Films&mdash;Solvent Casting </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Weigh a known weight of PCL directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and add sufficient DCM to achieve a 10% w/v solution. Cap the vial and mix the solution. Add sufficient paclitaxel to the solution to achieve the desired final paclitaxel concentration. Use hand shaking or vortexing to dissolve the paclitaxel in the solution. Let the solution sit for one hour (to diminish the presence of air bubbles) and then pour it slowly into a mould. The mould used is based on the shape required. Place the mould in the fume hood overnight. This will allow the DCM to evaporate. Either leave the film in the mould to store it or peel it out and store it in a sealed container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> 3. Procedure for Producing Films&mdash;Sprayed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Weigh sufficient polymer directly into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and add sufficient DCM to achieve a 2% w/v solution. Cap the vial and mix the solution to dissolve the polymer (hand shaking). Assemble the moulds in a vertical orientation in a suitable mould holding apparatus in the fume hood. Position this mould holding apparatus 6 to 12 inches above the fume hood floor on a suitable support (e.g., inverted 2000 ml glass beaker) to enable horizontal spraying. Using an automatic pipette, transfer a suitable volume (minimum 5 ml) of the 2% polymer solution to a separate 20 ml glass scintillation vial. Add sufficient paclitaxel to the solution and dissolve it by hand shaking the capped vial. To prepare for spraying, remove the cap of this vial and dip the barrel (only) of an TLC atomizer into the polymer solution. Note: the reservoir of the atomizer is not used in this procedure&mdash;the 20 ml glass vial acts as a reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Connect the nitrogen tank to the gas inlet of the atomizer. Gradually increase the pressure until atomization and spraying begins. Note the pressure and use this pressure throughout the procedure. To spray the moulds use 5 second oscillating sprays with a 15 second dry time between sprays. During the dry time, finger crimp the gas line to avoid wastage of the spray. Spraying is continued until a suitable thickness of polymer is deposited on the mould. The thickness is based on the request. Leave the sprayed films attached to the moulds and store in sealed containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> E. Procedure for Producing Nanopaste </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Nanopaste is a suspension of microspheres suspended in a hydrophilic gel. Within one aspect of the invention, the gel or paste can be smeared over tissue as a method of locating drug loaded microspheres close to the target tissue. Being water based, the paste will soon become diluted with bodily fluids causing a decrease in the stickiness of the paste and a tendency of the microspheres to be deposited on nearby tissue. A pool of microsphere encapsulated drug is thereby located close to the target tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Reagents and equipment which were utilized within these experiments include glass beakers, Carbopol 925 (pharmaceutical grade, Goodyear Chemical Co.), distilled water, sodium hydroxide (1 M) in water solution, sodium hydroxide solution (5 M) in water solution, microspheres in the 0.1 lm to 3 lm size range suspended in water at 20% w/v (See previous). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> 1. Preparation of 5% w/v Carbopol Gel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Add a sufficient amount of carbopol to 1 M sodium hydroxide to achieve a 5% w/v solution. To dissolve the carbopol in the 1 M sodium hydroxide, allow the mixture to sit for approximately one hour. During this time period, stir the mixture using a glass rod. After one hour, take the pH of the mixture. A low pH indicates that the carbopol is not fully dissolved. The pH you want to achieve is 7.4. Use 5 M sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. This is accomplished by slowly adding drops of 5 M sodium hydroxide to the mixture, stirring the mixture and taking the pH of the mixture. It usually takes approximately one hour to adjust the pH to 7.4. Once a pH of 7.4 is achieved, cover the gel and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours. After this time period, check the pH to ensure it is still at 7.4. If it has changed, adjust back to pH 7.4 using 5 M sodium hydroxide. Allow the gel to sit for a few hours to ensure the pH is stable at 7.4. Repeat the process until the desired pH is achieved and is stable. Label the container with the name of the gel and the date. The gel is to be used to make nanopaste within the next week. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Add sufficient 0.1 &mgr;m to 3 &mgr;m microspheres to water to produce a 20% suspension of the microspheres. Put 8 ml of the 5% w/v carbopol gel in a glass beaker. Add 2 ml of the 20% microsphere suspension to the beaker. Using a glass rod or a mixing spatula, stir the mixture to thoroughly disperse the microspheres throughout the gel. This usually takes 30 minutes. Once the microspheres are dispersed in the gel, place the mixture in a storage jar. Store the jar at 4&deg; C. It must be used within a one month period. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Controlled Delivery of Paclitaxel from Microspheres Composed of a Blend of Ethylene-Vinyl-Acetate Copolymer and Poly (D,L Lactic Acid). In Vivo Testing of the Microspheres on the Cam Assay </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> This example describes the preparation of paclitaxel-loaded microspheres composed of a blend of biodegradable poly (d,l-lactic acid) (PLA) polymer and nondegradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer. In addition, the in vitro release rate and anti-angiogenic activity of paclitaxel released from microspheres placed on a CAM are demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Reagents which were utilized in these experiments include paclitaxel, which is purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.); PLA (molecular weight 15,000-25,000) and EVA (60% vinyl acetate) (purchased from Polysciences (Warrington, Pa.); polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (molecular weight 124,000-186,000, 99% hydrolysed, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.)) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (HPLC grade, obtained from Fisher Scientific Co). Distilled water is used throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> A. Preparation of Microspheres </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Microspheres are prepared essentially as described in Example 8 utilizing the solvent evaporation method. Briefly, 5% w/v polymer solutions in 20 mL DCM are prepared using blends of EVA:PLA between 35:65 to 90:10. To 5 mL of 2.5% w/v PVA in water in a 20 mL glass vial is added 1 mL of the polymer solution dropwise with stirring. Six similar vials are assembled in a six position overhead stirrer, dissolution testing apparatus (Vanderkarnp) and stirred at 200 rpm. The temperature of the vials is increased from room temperature to 40&deg; C. over 15 min and held at 40&deg; C. for 2 hours. Vials are centrifuged at 500&times; g and the microspheres washed three times in water. At some EVA:PLA polymer blends, the microsphere samples aggregated during the washing stage due to the removal of the dispersing or emulsifying agent, PVA. This aggregation effect could be analyzed semi-quantitatively since aggregated microspheres fused and the fused polymer mass floated on the surface of the wash water. This surface polymer layer is discarded during the wash treatments and the remaining, pelleted microspheres are weighed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> The % aggregation is determined from </paragraph>

The polymer blend used is 50:50 EVA:PLA. A &ldquo;large&rdquo; size fraction and &ldquo;small&rdquo; size fraction of microspheres are produced by adding the paclitaxel/polymer solution dropwise into 2.5% w/v PVA and 5% w/v PVA, respectively. The dispersions are stirred at 40&deg; C. at 200 rpm for 2 hours, centrifuged and washed 3 times in water as described previously.

A 50:50 blend of EVA:PLA formed microspheres with good physical stability, that is the microspheres remained discrete and well suspended with negligible aggregation and coalescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> The size range for the &ldquo;small&rdquo; size fraction microspheres is determined to be&gt;95% of the microsphere sample (by weight) between 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;30 </superscript></highlight>mm and for the &ldquo;large&rdquo; size fraction, &gt;95% of the sample (by weight) between 30-100 mm.

The microspheres are spherical with a smooth surface and with no evidence of solid drug on the surface of the microspheres. The efficiency of loading 50:50 EVA:PLA microspheres with paclitaxel is between 95-100% at initial paclitaxel concentrations of between 100-1000 mg paclitaxel per 50 mg polymer. There is no significant difference (Student t-test, p&lt;0.05) between the encapsulation efficiencies for either &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;large&rdquo; microspheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> The time course of paclitaxel release from 0.6% w/v loaded 50:50 EVA:PLA microspheres is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</cross-reference> for &ldquo;small&rdquo; size (open circles) and &ldquo;large&rdquo; size (closed circles) microspheres. The release rate studies are carried out in triplicate tubes in 3 separate experiments. The release profiles are biphasic with an initial rapid release of paclitaxel or &ldquo;burst&rdquo; phase occurring over the first 4 days from both size range microspheres. This is followed by a phase of much slower release. There is no significant difference between the release rates from &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;large&rdquo; microspheres. Between 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;13</superscript></highlight>% of the total paclitaxel content of the microspheres is released in 50 days. </paragraph>

The paclitaxel microspheres released sufficient drug to produce a zone of avascularity in the surrounding tissue (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</cross-reference>). Note that immediately adjacent to the microspheres (&ldquo;MS&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15E and 15F</cross-reference>) is an area in which blood vessels are completely absent (Zone 1); further from the microspheres is an area of disrupted, non-functioning capillaries (Zone 2); it is only at a distance of approximately 6 mm from the microspheres that the capillaries return to normal. In CAMs treated with control microspheres (paclitaxel absent) there is a normal capillary network architecture (figure not shown.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Discussion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Arterial chemoembolization is an invasive surgical technique. Therefore, ideally, a chemoembolic formulation of an anti-angiogenic drug such as paclitaxel would release the drug at the tumor site at concentrations sufficient for activity for a prolonged period of time, of the order of several months. EVA is a tissue compatible nondegradable polymer which has been used extensively for the controlled delivery of macromolecules over long time periods (&gt;100 days). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> EVA is initially selected as a polymeric biomaterial for preparing microspheres with paclitaxel dispersed in the polymer matrix. However, microspheres prepared with 100% EVA aggregated and coalesced almost completely during the washing procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Polymers and copolymers based on lactic acid and glycolic acid are physiologically inert and biocompatible and degrade by hydrolysis to toxicologically acceptable products. Copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acids have faster degradation rates than PLA and drug loaded microspheres prepared using these copolymers are unsuitable for prolonged, controlled release over several months. Dollinger and Sawan blended PLA with EVA and showed that the degradation lifetime of PLA is increased as the proportion of EVA in the blend is increased. They suggested that blends of EVA and PLA should provide a polymer matrix with better mechanical stability and control of drug release rates than PLA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> shows that increasing the proportion of PLA in a EVA:PLA blend decreased the extent of aggregation of the microsphere suspensions. Blends of 50% or less EVA in the EVA:PLA matrix produced physically stable microsphere suspensions in water or PBS. A blend of 50:50 EVA:PLA is selected for all subsequent studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> Different size range fractions of microspheres could be prepared by changing the concentration of the emulsifier, PVA, in the aqueous phase. &ldquo;Small&rdquo; microspheres are produced at the higher PVA concentration of 5% w/v whereas &ldquo;large&rdquo; microspheres are produced at 2.5% w/v PVA All other production variables are the same for both microsphere size fractions. The higher concentration of emulsifier gave a more viscous aqueous dispersion medium and produced smaller droplets of polymer/paclitaxel/DCM emulsified in the aqueous phase and thus smaller microspheres. The paclitaxel loaded microspheres contained between 95-100% of the initial paclitaxel added to the organic phase encapsulated within the solid microspheres. The low water solubility of paclitaxel favoured partitioning into the organic phase containing the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Release rates of paclitaxel from the 50:50 EVA:PLA microspheres are very slow with less than 15% of the loaded paclitaxel being released in 50 days. The initial burst phase of drug release may be due to diffusion of drug from the superficial region of the microspheres (close to the microsphere surface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> The mechanism of drug release from nondegradable polymeric matrices such as EVA is thought to involve the diffusion of water through the dispersed drug phase within the polymer, dissolution of the drug and diffusion of solute through a series of interconnecting, fluid filled pores. Blends of EVA and PLA have been shown to be immiscible or bicontinuous over a range of 30 to 70% EVA in PLA. In degradation studies in PBS buffer at 37&deg; C., following an induction or lag period, PLA hydrolytically degraded and eroded from the EVA:PLA polymer blend matrix leaving an inactive sponge-like skeleton. Although the induction period and rate of PLA degradation and erosion from the blended matrices depended on the proportion of PLA in the matrix and on process history, there is consistently little or no loss of PLA until after 40-50 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Although some erosion of PLA from the 50:50 EVA:PLA microspheres may have occurred within the 50 days of the in vitro release rate study (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference>), it is likely that the primary mechanism of drug release from the polymer blend is diffusion of solute through a pore network in the polymer matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> At the conclusion of the release rate study, the microspheres are analyzed from the amount of drug remaining. The values for the percent of paclitaxel remaining in the 50 day incubation microsphere samples are 94% &plus;/&minus;9% and 89% &plus;/&minus;12% for &ldquo;large&rdquo; and &ldquo;small&rdquo; size fraction microspheres, respectively. </paragraph>

The initial phase of rapid release is followed by a phase of significantly slower drug release. For microspheres containing 1% or 2% paclitaxel there is no further drug release after 21 days. At 5% paclitaxel loading, the microspheres had released about 20% of the total drug content after 21 days. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> G. Discussion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> The solvent evaporation method of manufacturing paclitaxel-loaded microspheres produced very high paclitaxel encapsulation efficiencies of between 95-100%. This is due to the poor water solubility of paclitaxel and its hydrophobic nature favouring partitioning in the organic solvent phase containing the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> The biphasic release profile for paclitaxel is typical of the release pattern for many drugs from biodegradable polymer matrices. Poly(e-caprolactone) is an aliphatic polyester which can be degraded by hydrolysis under physiological conditions and it is non-toxic and tissue compatible. The degradation of PCL is significantly slower than that of the extensively investigated polymers and copolymers of lactic and glycolic acids and is therefore suitable for the design of long-term drug delivery systems. The initial rapid or burst phase of paclitaxel release is thought to be due to diffusional release of the drug from the superficial region of the microspheres (close to the microsphere surface). Release of paclitaxel in the second (slower) phase of the release profiles is not likely due to degradation or erosion of PCL because studies have shown that under in vitro conditions in water there is no significant weight loss or surface erosion of PCL over a 7.5-week period. The slower phase of paclitaxel release is probably due to dissolution of the drug within fluid-filled pores in the polymer matrix and diffusion through the pores. The greater release rate at higher paclitaxel loading is probably a result of a more extensive pore network within the polymer matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel microspheres with 5% loading have been shown to release sufficient drug to produce extensive inhibition of angiogenesis when placed on the CAM.

<heading lvl="1">Paclitaxel-Loaded Polymeric Films Composed of Ethylene Vinyl Acetate and a Surfactant </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> Two types of films are investigated within this example: pure EVA films loaded with paclitaxel and EVA/surfactant blend films loaded with paclitaxel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> The surfactants being examined are two hydrophobic surfactants (Span 80 and Pluronic L101) and one hydrophilic surfactant (Pluronic F127). The pluronic surfactants are themselves polymers, which is an attractive property since they can be blended with EVA to optimize various drug delivery properties. Span 80 is a smaller molecule which is in some manner dispersed in the polymer matrix, and does not form a blend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Surfactants is useful in modulating the release rates of paclitaxel from films and optimizing certain physical parameters of the films. One aspect of the surfactant blend films which indicates that drug release rates can be controlled is the ability to vary the rate and extent to which the compound will swell in water. Diffusion of water into a polymer-drug matrix is critical to the release of drug from the carrier. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</cross-reference> show the degree of swelling of the films as the level of surfactant in the blend is altered. Pure EVA films do not swell to any significant extent in over 2 months. However, by increasing the level of surfactant added to the EVA it is possible to increase the degree of swelling of the compound, and by increasing hydrophilicity swelling can also be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> Results of experiments with these films are shown below in FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A-E. Briefly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> shows paclitaxel release (in mg) over time from pure EVA films. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference> shows the percentage of drug remaining for the same films. As can be seen from these two figures, as paclitaxel loading increases (i.e., percentage of paclitaxel by weight is increased), drug release rates increase, showing the expected concentration dependence. As paclitaxel loading is increased, the percent paclitaxel remaining in the film also increases, indicating that higher loading may be more attractive for long-term release formulations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Physical strength and elasticity of the films is assessed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</cross-reference>. Briefly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</cross-reference> shows stress/strain curves for pure EVA and EVA-Surfactant blend films. This crude measurement of stress demonstrates that the elasticity of films is increased with the addition of Pluronic F127, and that the tensile strength (stress on breaking) is increased in a concentration dependent manner with the addition of Pluronic F127. Elasticity and strength are important considerations in designing a film which can be manipulated for particular clinical applications without causing permanent deformation of the compound. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> The melting point of PCL/MePEG polymer blends may be determined by differential scanning calorimetry from 30&deg; C. to 70&deg; C. at a heating rate of 2.5&deg; C. per minute. Results of this experiment are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>. Briefly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> the melting point of the polymer blend (as determined by thermal analysis) is decreased by MePEG in a concentration dependent manner. The melting point of the polymer blends as a function of MePEG concentration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference>. This lower melting point also translates into an increased time for the polymer blends to solidify from melt as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference>. A 30:70 blend of MePEG:PCL takes more than twice as long to solidify from the fluid melt than does PCL alone. </paragraph>

As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>D, the amount of weight lost increases with the concentration of MePEG originally present in the blend. It is likely that this weight loss is due to the release of MePEG from the polymer matrix into the incubating fluid. This would indicate that paclitaxel will readily be released from a MePEG/PCL blend since paclitaxel is first dissolved in MePEG before incorporation into PCL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> E. Effect of Varying Quantities of MePEG on Paclitaxel Release </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Thermopastes are made up containing between 0.8% and 20% MePEG in PCL. These are loaded with 1% paclitaxel. The release of paclitaxel over time from 10 mg pellets in PBS buffer at 37&deg; C. is monitored using HPLC. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>E, the amount of MePEG in the formulation does not affect the amount of paclitaxel that is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> F. Effect of Varying Quantities of Paclitaxel on the Total Amount of Paclitaxel Released From a 20% MePEG/PCL Blend </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> Thermopastes are made up containing 20% MePEG in PCL and loaded with between 0.2% and 10% paclitaxel. The release of paclitaxel over time is measured as described above. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>F, the amount of paclitaxel released over time increases with increased paclitaxel loading. When plotted as the percent total paclitaxel released, however, the order is reversed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18G</cross-reference>). This gives information about the residual paclitaxel remaining in the paste and allows for a projection of the period of time over which paclitaxel may be released from the 20% MePEG Thermopaste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> G. Strength Analysis of Various MePEG/PCL Blends </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> A CT-40 mechanical strength tester is used to measure the strength of solid polymer &ldquo;tablets&rdquo; of diameter 0.88 cm and an average thickness of 0.560 cm. The polymer tablets are blends of MePEG at concentrations of 0%, 5%, 10% or 20% in PCL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> Results of this test are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>H, where both the tensile strength and the time to failure are plotted as a function of % MePEG in the blend. Single variable ANOVA indicated that the tablet thicknesses within each group are not different. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>H, the addition of MePEG into PCL decreased the hardness of the resulting solid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Fertilized, domestic chick embryos were incubated for 4 days prior to shell-less culturing as described in Example 2. The egg contents are removed from the shell and emptied into roundbottom sterilized glass bowls and covered with petri dish covers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel is incorporated into thermopaste at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% (w/v) essentially as described above (see Example 10), and used in the following experiments on the CAM. Dried thermopaste disks weighing 3 mg were made by heating the paste to 60&deg; C., forming drop size aliquots, and then allowing it to cool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> In addition, unloaded thermopaste and thermopaste containing 20% paclitaxel were also heated to 60&deg; C. and placed directly on the growing edge of each CAM at day 6 of incubation; two animals each were treated in this manner. There was no observable difference in the results obtained using the different methods of administration indicating that the temperature of the paste at the time of application was not a factor in the outcome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> Each concentration of paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) was tested on 4 to 9 embryos at day 6 of development (see Table III). After a 2 day exposure (day 8 of incubation) the vasculature was examined with the aid of a stereomicroscope. Liposyn II, a white opaque solution, was injected into the CAM which increases the visibility of the vascular details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> The 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste induced an extensive area of avascularity (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference>) in all 6 of the CAMs receiving this treatment. The highest degree of inhibition was defined as a region of avascularity covering an area of 6 mm in diameter. All of the CAMs treated with 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste displayed this degree of angiogenesis inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> In the animals treated with 5% paclitaxel-loaded paste, 4 animals demonstrated maximum inhibition of angiogenesis. Of the animals treated with 10% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste, only 5 illustrated maximal inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> The results of this study also show that paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste, as low as 0.25%, can release a significant amount of drug to induce angiogenesis inhibition on the CAM. (Table IV, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19C and 19D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> By comparison, the control (unloaded) thermopaste did not inhibit angiogenesis on the CAM (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>A); this higher magnification view (note that the edge of the paste is seen at the top of the image) demonstrates that the vessels adjacent to the paste are unaffected by the thermopaste. This suggests that the avascular effect observed is due to the sustained release of paclitaxel and is not due to the polymer itself or due to a secondary pressure effect of the paste on the developing vasculature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> This study also demonstrates that thermopaste releases sufficient quantities of angiogenesis inhibitor (in this case paclitaxel) to inhibit the normal development of the CAM vasculature.

<heading lvl="1">Effect of Paclitaxel-Loaded Thermopaste on Tumor Growth and Tumor Angiogenesis in vivo </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> Fertilized domestic chick embryos are incubated for 3 days prior to having their shells removed. The egg contents are emptied by removing the shell located around the airspace, severing the interior shell membrane, perforating the opposite end of the shell and allowing the egg contents to gently slide out from the blunted end. The contents are emptied into round-bottom sterilized glass bowls, covered with petri dish covers and incubated at 90% relative humidity and 3% carbon dioxide (see Example 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> MDAY-D2 cells (a murine lymphoid tumor) is injected into mice and allowed to grow into tumors weighing 0.5-1.0 g. The mice are sacrificed, the tumor sites wiped with alcohol, excised, placed in sterile tissue culture media, and diced into 1 mm pieces under a laminar flow hood. Prior to placing the dissected tumors onto the 9-day old chick embryos, CAM surfaces are gently scraped with a 30 gauge needle to insure tumor implantation. The tumors are then placed on the CAMs after 8 days of incubation (4 days after deshelling), and allowed to grow on the CAM for four days to establish a vascular supply. Four embryos are prepared utilizing this method, each embryo receiving 3 tumors. For these embryos, one tumor receives 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste, the second tumor unloaded thermopaste, and the third tumor no treatment. The treatments are continued for two days before the results were recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> The explanted MDAY-D2 tumors secrete angiogenic factors which induce the ingrowth of capillaries (derived from the CAM) into the tumor mass and allow it to continue to grow in size. Since all the vessels of the tumor are derived from the CAM, while all the tumor cells are derived from the explant, it is possible to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions on these two processes independently. This assay has been used to determine the effectiveness of paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste on: (a) inhibiting the vascularization of the tumor and (b) inhibiting the growth of the tumor cells themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> Direct in vivo stereomicroscopic evaluation and histological examination of fixed tissues from this study demonstrated the following. In the tumors treated with 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste, there was a reduction in the number of the blood vessels which supplied the tumor (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20C and 20D</cross-reference>), a reduction in the number of blood vessels within the tumor, and a reduction in the number of blood vessels in the periphery of the tumor (the area which is typically the most highly vascularized in a solid tumor) when compared to control tumors. The tumors began to decrease in size and mass during the two days the study was conducted. Additionally, numerous endothelial cells were seen to be arrested in cell division indicating that endothelial cell proliferation had been affected. Tumor cells were also frequently seen arrested in mitosis. All 4 embryos showed a consistent pattern with the 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste suppressing tumor vascularity while the unloaded thermopaste had no effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> By comparison, in CAMs treated with unloaded thermopaste, the tumors were well vascularized with an increase in the number and density of vessels when compared to that of the normal surrounding tissue, and dramatically more vessels than were observed in the tumors treated with paclitaxel-loaded paste. The newly formed vessels entered the tumor from all angles appearing like spokes attached to the center of a wheel (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</cross-reference>). The control tumors continued to increase in size and mass during the course of the study. Histologically, numerous dilated thin-walled capillaries were seen in the periphery of the tumor and few endothelial were seen to be in cell division. The tumor tissue was well vascularized and viable throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> As an example, in two similarly-sized (initially, at the time of explantation) tumors placed on the same CAM the following data was obtained. For the tumor treated with 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste the tumor measured 330 mm&times;597 mm; the immediate periphery of the tumor has 14 blood vessels, while the tumor mass has only 34 small capillaries. For the tumor treated with unloaded thermopaste the tumor size was 623 mm&times;678 mm; the immediate periphery of the tumor has 54 blood vessels, while the tumor mass has 12-14 small blood vessels. In addition, the surrounding CAM itself contained many more blood vessels as compared to the area surrounding the paclitaxel-treated tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> This study demonstrates that thermopaste releases sufficient quantities of angiogenesis inhibitor (in this case paclitaxel) to inhibit the pathological angiogenesis which accompanies tumor growth and development. Under these conditions angiogenesis is maximally stimulated by the tumor cells which produce angiogenic factors capable of inducing the ingrowth of capillaries from the surrounding tissue into the tumor mass. The 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste is capable of blocking this process and limiting the ability of the tumor tissue to maintain an adequate blood supply. This results in a decrease in the tumor mass both through a cytotoxic effect of the drug on the tumor cells themselves and by depriving the tissue of the nutrients required for growth and expansion. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> The murine MDAY-D2 tumor model may be used to examine the effect of local slow release of the chemotherapeutic and anti-angiogenic compounds such as paclitaxel on tumor growth, tumor metastasis, and animal survival. The MDAY-D2 tumor cell line is grown in a cell suspension consisting of 5% Fetal Calf Serum in alpha mem media. The cells are incubated at 37&deg; C. in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% carbon dioxide, and are diluted by a factor of 15 every 3 days until a sufficient number of cells are obtained. Following the incubation period the cells are examined by light microscopy for viability and then are centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. PBS is added to the cells to achieve a dilution of 1,000,000 cells per ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> Ten week old DBA/2 j female mice are acclimatized for 34 days after arrival. Each mouse is then injected subcutaneously in the posteriolateral flank with 100,000 MDAY-D2 cells in 100 ml of PBS. Previous studies have shown that this procedure produces a visible tumor at the injection site in 3-4 days, reach a size of 1.0-1.7 g by 14 days, and produces visible metastases in the liver 19-25 days post-injection. Depending upon the objective of the study a therapeutic intervention can be instituted at any point in the progression of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> Using the above animal model, 20 mice are injected with 140,000 MDAY-D2 cells s.c. and the tumors allowed to grow. On day 5 the mice are divided into groups of 5. The tumor site was surgically opened under anesthesia, the local region treated with the drug-loaded thermopaste or control thermopaste without disturbing the existing tumor tissue, and the wound was closed. The groups of 5 received either no treatment (wound merely closed), polymer (PCL) alone, 10% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste, or 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste (only 4 animals injected) implanted adjacent to the tumor site. On day 16, the mice were sacrificed, the tumors were dissected and examined (grossly and histologically) for tumor growth, tumor metastasis, local and systemic toxicity resulting from the treatment, effect on wound healing, effect on tumor vascularity, and condition of the paste remaining at the incision site. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> Thermopaste loaded with 20% paclitaxel reduced tumor growth by over 85% (average weight 0.105) as compared to control animals (average weight 0.681). Animals treated with thermopaste alone or thermopaste containing 10% paclitaxel had only modest effects on tumor growth; tumor weights were reduced by only 10% and 35% respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference>). Therefore, thermopaste containing 20% paclitaxel was more effective in reducing tumor growth than thermopaste containing 10% paclitaxel (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</cross-reference>; see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> Thermopaste was detected in some of the animals at the site of administration. Polymer varying in weight between 0.026 g to 0.078 g was detected in 8 of 15 mice. Every animal in the group containing 20% paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste contained some residual polymer suggesting that it was less susceptible to dissolution. Histologically, the tumors treated with paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste contained lower cellularity and more tissue necrosis than control tumors. The vasculature was reduced and endothelial cells were frequently seen to be arrested in cell division. The paclitaxel-loaded thermopaste did not appear to affect the integrity or cellularity of the skin or tissues surrounding the tumor. Grossly, wound healing was unaffected. </paragraph>

A concentration of 1 million live 9L Glioma tumor cells (eluted from tissue culture immediately prior to the procedure) suspended in 100 ml of phosphate buffered saline are deposited onto the cut liver edge with a 30 gauge needle. The surgical is then placed over the cut liver edge containing the tumor cells and affixed in place with Gelfoam. Two animals received PCL films containing 5% paclitaxel and two animals received films containing PCL alone. The abdominal wall is closed with 3.0 Dexon and skin clips.

<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> Articular damage in arthritis is due to a combination of inflammation (including WBCs and WBC products) and pannus tissue development (a tissue composed on neovascular tissue, connective tissue, and inflammatory cells). Paclitaxel has been chosen for the initial studies because it is a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. In this manner, paclitaxel in high local concentrations will prove to be a disease modifying agent in arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> In order to determine whether microspheres have a deleterious effect on joints, the following experiments are conducted.

<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> The rabbit inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis models may be utilized in order to evaluate the use of microspheres in reducing synovitis and cartilage degradation. Briefly, degenerative arthritis is induced by a partial tear of the cruciate ligament and meniscus of the knee. After 4 to 6 weeks, the rabbits develop erosions in the cartilage similar to that observed in human osteoarthritis. Inflammatory-arthritis is induced by immunizing rabbits with bovine serum albumen (BSA) in Complete Freund&apos;s Adjuvant (CFA). After 3 weeks, rabbits containing a high titer of anti-BSA antibody receive an intra-articular injection of BSA (5 mg). Joint swelling and pronounced synovitis is apparent by seven days, a proteoglycan depletion is observed by 7 to 14 days, and cartilage erosions are observed by 4 to 6 weeks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> Inflammatory arthritis is induced as described above. After 4 days, the joints are injected with microspheres containing 5% paclitaxel or vehicle. One group of animals is sacrificed on day 14 and another on day 28. The joints are examined histologically for inflammation and cartilage degradation. The experiment is designed to determine if paclitaxel microspheres can affect joint inflammation and cartilage matrix degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> Angiogenesis-inhibitor microspheres may be further examined in an osteoarthritis model. Briefly, degenerative arthritis is induced in rabbits as described above, and the joints receive an intra-articular injection of microspheres (5% paclitaxel or vehicle only) on day 4. The animals are sacrificed on day 21 and day 42 and the joints examined histologically for evidence of cartilage degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> Unloaded PCL microspheres of differing sizes (0.5-5.0 &mgr;m, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;30 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;m, or 30-80 &mgr;m) are injected intra-articularly into the rabbit knee joint. Results of these experiments are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>D. Briefly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> is a photograph of synovium from PBS injected joints. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</cross-reference> is a photograph of joints injected with microspheres. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</cross-reference> is a photograph of cartilage from joints injected with PBS, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</cross-reference> is a photograph of cartilage from joints injected with microspheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from these photographs, histologically, there is no difference between joints receiving a microsphere injection and those which did not. Clinically, there was no evidence of joint inflammation during the 14 days the experiment was conducted. Grossly, there is no evidence of joint inflammation or cartilage damage in joints where microspheres are injected, as compared to untreated normal joints. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> Microspheres can be injected intra-articularly without causing any discernible changes to the joint surface. This indicates that this method may be an effective means of delivering a targeted, sustained-release of disease-modifying agents to diseased joints, while minimizing the toxicity which could be associated with the systemic administration of such biologically active compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, microspheres can be formulated into specific sizes with defined drug release kinetics. It has also been demonstrated that paclitaxel is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and that it is released from microspheres in quantities sufficient to block neovascularization on the CAM assay. Therefore, angiogenesis-inhibitor-loaded (e.g., paclitaxel-loaded) microspheres may be administered intra-articularly in order to block the neovascularization that occurs in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In this manner the drug-loaded microspheres can act as a &ldquo;chondroprotective&rdquo; agent which protects the cartilage from irreversible destruction from invading neovascular pannus tissue. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Anti-Angiogenic Effects of Paclitaxel in an Ophthalmic Suspension </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> In order to test whether paclitaxel would inhibit the pathogenesis of corneal neovascularization, an ophthalmic suspension of 0.3% paclitaxel and a 10% paclitaxel microsphere suspension was first prepared and tested on the CAM in order to determine whether sufficient quantities of paclitaxel could be released to inhibit angiogenesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Briefly, fertilized, chick eggs were incubated for 4 days prior to shell-less culturing as described previously in Example 2. The egg contents are removed from the shell and emptied into round-bottom sterilized glass bowls and covered with petri dish covers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> On day 6 of development, the ophthalmic drops were tested on the CAM. To deliver the ophthalmic suspensions, a 0.5 mL syringe was sliced into rings measuring 1 mm thick. These rings, which formed wells when placed onto the CAM were used to localize a 15 &mgr;L aliquot of ophthalmic suspension to the CAMs blood vessels. The paclitaxel (0.3%) suspension was tested on 11 embryos, whereas the 10% paclitaxel-loaded microsphere suspension was tested on 4 other embryos. The control (unloaded) ophthalmic suspension was tested on the remaining 5 CAMs. After a 48 hour period, Liposyn II, a white opaque solution, was injected into the CAM which increased the visibility of the vascular details when observed with a stereomicroscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> Within 48 hours, the 0.3% paclitaxel suspension inhibited angiogenesis on 11/11 CAMs tested and the 10% paclitaxel-loaded microsphere suspension inhibited angiogenesis on 4/4 of the embryos tested. This was evident by the presence of avascular zones measuring 6 mm in diameter in the vicinity of the treated area (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>A); in many cases the avascular zone exceeded the size of the application ring. This avascular zone was defined as a region containing disrupted blood vessel fragments and discontinuous blood flow. The functional vessels adjacent to the avascular zone were modified in such a way to redirect the blood flow away from the drug source; these vessels possessed an angular architecture which was not evident in the control (unloaded) thermopaste treated CAMs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> In comparison, the control (unloaded) ophthalmic vehicle did not inhibit angiogenesis on any of the 5 CAMs tested; this was evident by the functional vessels visible within the center of the application ring (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</cross-reference>). In some cases, there was some reduction in the amount of microvessels located in the control treated CAMs although this was only due to the aqueous suspension vehicle in which paclitaxel was administered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> In summary, paclitaxel was sufficiently released from the ophthalmic drop suspension to inhibit angiogenesis on the CAM. Therefore, since paclitaxel can be released from this vehicle system, it may likewise be utilized in the treatment of neovascular disease of the eye, such as corneal neovascularization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Anti-Angiogenic Effects of Paclitaxel-Loaded Stent Coating </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> A. Testing of Paclitaxel-Loaded Stents on a CAM </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> As noted above, stents are currently used for the prevention of luminal closure induced by a disease process, such as biliary tumor ingrowth. Although stents prevent tumor ingrowth temporarily, tumor ingrowth eventually recurs. In this study, strecker stents were coated with an EVA polymer containing paclitaxel at concentrations of 33%, 10%, and 2.5% and were tested for their ability to inhibit angiogenesis on the CAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> Briefly, paclitaxel-coated stent tynes (3 mm in size) were placed onto the growing vessels of the CAM at day 6 of development. Of these CAMs, 3 received 33% paclitaxel-loaded stent coating, 5 CAMs received 2.5% paclitaxel, and 1 CAM received 10% paclitaxel-loaded stent coating. In addition, control stents, coated with unloaded EVA, were tested on a total of 6 CAMs. After 48 hours, Liposyn II was injected within the CAM to increase the vascular details during observations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> All 3 different paclitaxel concentrations of the stent coating inhibited angiogenesis on the CAM within the 48 hour period. The CAMs were maximally inhibited which was characterized by the induction of avascular zones measuring 6 mm in diameter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> B. Testing of Control Stents in Tumors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Similar to above, control stents were prepared as described above and placed into established gliosarcoma tumors of the rat liver. After a 7 day period, these rats were sedated and perfused with a 2.0% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate solution. The livers were excised and the stents were dissected away from the surrounding tissue. Images of the gross anatomy revealed that the nylon stents had become incorporated into the tumor and tumor ingrowth had been established within the lumen of the stent (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows that metastasis had occurred within the lung. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Unlike the paclitaxel-loaded stent coating, the control coating did not inhibit angiogenesis and maintained its normal architecture in all of the 6 CAMs which were tested (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> In summary, since paclitaxel coated stents have the capability of releasing sufficient drug to inhibit angiogenesis on the CAM, paclitaxel coated stents may likewise be utilized for a variety of applications in order to prevent tumor ingrowth within the binary lumen. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Effect of Paclitaxel on Neutrophil Activity </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> The example describes the effect of paclitaxel on the response of neutrophils stimulated with opsonized CPPD crystals or opsonized zymosan. As shown by experiments set forth below, paclitaxel is a strong inhibitor of particulate inducted neutrophil activation as measured by chemiluminescence, superoxide anion production and degranulation in response to plasma opsonized microcrystals or zymosan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> A. Materials and Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS) pH 7.4 was used throughout this study. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis,) unless otherwise stated. All experiments were performed at 37&deg; C. unless otherwise stated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> 1. Preparation and Characterization of Crystals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> CPPD (triclinic) crystals were prepared. The size distribution of the crystals was approximately 33% less than 10 &mgr;m, 58% between 10 and 20 &mgr;m and 9% greater than 20 &mgr;m. Crystals prepared under the above conditions are pyrogen free and crystals produced under sterile, pyrogen free conditions produced the same magnitude of neutrophil response as crystals prepared under normal, non-sterile laboratory conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> 2. Opsonization of Crystals and Zymosan </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> All experiments that studied neutrophil responses to crystals or zymosan in the presence of paclitaxel were performed using plasma opsonized CPPD or zymosan. Opsonization of crystals or zymosan was done with 50% heparinized plasma at a concentration of 75 mg of CPPD or 12 mg of zymosan per ml of 50% plasma. Crystals or zymosan were incubated with plasma for 30 min. at 37&deg; C. and then washed in excess HBSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> 3. Neutrophil Preparation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> Neutrophils were prepared from freshly collected human citrated whole blood. Briefly, 400 ml of blood were mixed with 80 ml of 4% dextran T500 (Phamacia LKB, Biotechnology AB Uppsala, Sweden) in HBSS and allowed to settle for 1 h. Plasma was collected continuously and 5 ml applied to 5 ml of Ficoll Paque (Pharmacia) in 15 ml polypropylene tubes (Coming, N.Y.). Following centrifugation at 500&times; g for 30 min, the neutrophil pellets were washed free of erythrocytes by 20 s of hypotonic shock. Neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS, kept on ice and used for experiments within 3 h. Neutrophil viability and purity was always greater than 90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> 4. Incubation of Neutrophils with Paclitaxel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> A stock solution of paclitaxel at 12 mM in DMSO was freshly prepared before each experiment. This stock solution was diluted in DMSO to give solutions of paclitaxel in the 1 to 10 mM concentration range. Equal volumes of these diluted paclitaxel solutions was added to neutrophils at 5,000,000 cells per ml under mild vortexing to achieve concentrations of 0 to 50 &mgr;M with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 33&deg; C. then for 10 minutes at 37&deg; C. before addition to crystals or zymosan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> 5. Chemiluminescence Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> All chemiluminescence studies were performed at a cell concentration of 5,000,000 cells/ml in HBSS with CPPD (50 mg/ml). In all experiments 0.5 ml of cells was added to 25 mg of CPPD or 0.5 mg of zymosan in 1.5 ml capped Eppendorf tubes. 10 &mgr;l of luminol dissolved in 25% DMSO in HBSS was added to a final concentration of 1 &mgr;M and the samples were mixed to initiate neutrophil activation by the crystals or zymosan. Chemiluminescence was monitored using an LKB Luminometer (Model 1250.) at 37&deg; C. with shaking immediately prior to measurements to resuspend the crystals or zymosan. Control tubes contained cells, drug and luminol (crystals absent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> 6. Superoxide Anion Generation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> Superoxide anion concentrations were measured using the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c assay. Briefly, 25 mg of crystals or 0.5 mg of zymosan was placed in a 1.5 ml capped Eppendorf tube and warmed to 37&deg; C. 0.5 ml of cells at 37&deg; C. were added together with ferricytochrome c (final concentration 1.2 mg/ml) and the cells were activated by shaking the capped tubes. At appropriate times tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 seconds and the supernatant collected for assay be measuring the absorbance of 550 nm. Control tubes were set up under the same conditions with the inclusion of superoxide dismutase at 600 units per ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> 7. Neutrophil Degramulation Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> One and a half milliliter Eppendorf tubes containing either 25 mg of CPPD or 1 mg of zymosan were preheated to 37&deg; C. 0.5 ml of cells at 37&deg; C. were added followed by vigorous shaking to initiate the reactions. At appropriate times, tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 &times; g for 10 seconds and 0.4 ml of supernatant was stored at &minus;20&deg; C. for later assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> Lysozyme was measured by the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm of a <highlight><italic>Micrococcus lysodeikticus </italic></highlight>suspension. Briefly, <highlight><italic>Micrococcus lysodeikticus </italic></highlight>was suspended at 0.1 mg/ml in 65 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2 and the absorbance at 450 nm was adjusted to 0.7 units by dilution. The crystal (or zymosan) and cell supernatant (100 &mgr;l) was added to 2.5 ml of the Micrococcus suspension and the decrease in absorbance was monitored. Lysozyme standards (chicken egg white) in the 0 to 2000 units/ml range were prepared and a calibration graph of lyzozyme concentration against the rate of decrease in the absorbance at 450 nm was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured by the increase in absorbance at 450 nm that accompanies the oxidation of dianisidine. 7.8 mg of dianisidine was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5 at 3.2 mM by sonication. To a 1 ml cuvette, 0.89 mL of the dianisidine solution was added, followed by 50 &mgr;l of 1% Triton&times;100, 10 &mgr;l of a 0.05% hydrogen peroxide in water solution and 50 &mgr;l of crystal-cell supernatant. MPO activity was determined from the change in absorbance (450 nm) per minute, Delta A 450, using the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Dianisidine oxidation (nmol/min)&equals;50&times;Delta A 450 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> 8. Neutrophil Viability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> To determine the effect of paclitaxel on neutrophil viability the release of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured. Control tubes containing cells with drug (crystals absent) from degranulation experiments were also assayed for LDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> B. Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> In all experiments statistical significance was determined using Students&apos; t-test and significance was claimed at p&lt;0.05. Where error bars are shown they describe one standard deviation about the mean value for the n number given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> 1. Neutrophil Viability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> Neutrophils treated with paclitaxel at 46 &mgr;M for one hour at 37&deg; C. did not show any increased level of LDH release (always less than 5% of total) above controls indicating that paclitaxel did not cause cell death. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> 2. Chemiliminescence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M produced strong inhibition of both plasma opsonized CPPD and plasma opsonised zymosan induced neutrophil chemiluminescence as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A, 29B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A respectively. The inhibition of the peak chemiluminescence response was 52% (&plus;/&minus;12%) and 45% (&plus;1-11%) for CPPD and zymosan respectively. The inhibition by paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M of both plasma opsonized CPPD and plasma opsonized zymosan induced chemiluminescence was significant at all times from 3 to 16 minutes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A, 29B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</cross-reference> show the concentration dependence of paclitaxel inhibition of plasma opsonized CPPD induced neutrophil chemiluminescence. In all experiments control samples never produced chemiluminescence values of greater than 5 mV and the addition of paclitaxel at all concentrations used in this study had no effect on the chemiluminescence values of controls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> 3. Superoxide Generation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> The time course of plasma opsonised CPPD crystal induced superoxide anion production, as measured by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Treatment of the cells with paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M produced a decrease in the amount of superoxide generated at all times. This decrease was significant at all times shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</cross-reference>. The concentration dependence of this inhibition is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</cross-reference>. Stimulation of superoxide anion production by opsonised zymosan (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference>) showed a similar time course to CPPD induced activation. The inhibition of zymosan induced superoxide anion production by paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M was less dramatic than the inhibition of CPPD activation but was significant at all times shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> 4. Neutrophil Degranulation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> Neutrophil degranulation was monitored by the plasma opsonized CPPD crystal induced release of myeloperoxidase and lysozyme or the plasma opsonized zymosan induced release of myeloperoxidase. It has been shown that sufficient amounts of these two enzymes are released into the extracellular media when plasma coated CPPD crystals are used to stimulate neutrophils without the need for the addition of cytochalasin B to the cells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</cross-reference> show the time course of the release of MPO and lysozyme respectively, from neutrophils stimulated by plasma coated CPPD. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</cross-reference> shows that paclitaxel inhibits myeloperoxidase release from plasma opsonized CPPD activated neutrophils in the first 9 minutes of the crystal-cell incubation. Paclitaxel significantly inhibited CPPD induced myeloperoxidase release at all times as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</cross-reference> shows the concentration dependence of paclitaxel inhibition of CPPD induced myeloperoxidase release. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M reduced lysozyme release and this inhibition of degranulation was significant at all times as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> Only minor amounts of MPO and lysozyme were released when neutrophils were stimulated with opsonized zymosan. Despite these low levels it was possible to monitor 50% inhibition of MPO release after 9 minutes incubation in the presence of paclitaxel at 28 &mgr;M that was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> C. Discussion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> These experiments demonstrate that paclitaxel is a strong inhibitor of crystal induced neutrophil activation. In addition, by showing similar levels of inhibition in neutrophil responses to another form of particulate activator, opsonized zymozan, it is evident that the inhibitory activity of paclitaxel is not limited to neutrophil responses to crystals. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> This study demonstrated that paclitaxel at low concentrations inhibits the incorporation of 3H-thymidine (and by extension DNA synthesis) in synoviocytes at concentrations as low as 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M. At six hours there was no significant difference in the between the degree of inhibition produced by the higher versus the lower concentrations of paclitaxel (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>). However, by 24 hours some of the effect was lost at lower concentrations of the drug (10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M), but was still substantially lower than that seen in control animals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Effect of Paclitaxel on Collagenase Expression </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> As noted above, collagenase production by a variety of tissues (synovial fibroblasts, endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and white blood cells) plays an critical role in the development of the pathology of arthritis. Degradation of the cartilage matrix by proteolytic enzymes represents an irreversible step in the development of the disease resulting in irreparable damage to the articular cartilage. Numerous attempts have been made to restore the balance between the enzymes which degrade connective tissue (matrix metalloproteinases&mdash;MMPs; collagenase is an important member of this family) and those which inhibit degradation (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases&mdash;TIMPs). Evidence suggests that the imbalance of proteolytic versus inhibitory activity which results in cartilage destruction is due to an excess of MMP activity as opposed to a paucity of TIMP activity. Treatment that decreases the amount of MMP activity may thus favorably influence the outcome of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0490" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0490&rsqb;</number> C-fos is an oncogene transcription factor shown to be involved and required for the induction of genes involved in cell proliferation and collagenase expression. In cultured chondrocytes, both interleukin-1 (1L-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been shown to stimulate c-fos expression and produce all of the signals necessary to induce the expression of collagenase. When IL-1 is administered to chondrocytes in vitro there is a transient increase in fos mRNA levels which peak 30-60 minutes later, while collagenase mRNA is detected 9 hours later and continues to increase up to 12 hours (data not shown) after IL-1 stimulation. The fos and collagenase mRNA can be detected using the respective cDNA probes and analyzed by Northern blot analysis. This allows the determination of agents capable of inhibiting collagenase production and an approximation of the step in the collagenase synthetic pathway that is affected by the treatment. </paragraph>

Total RNA from bovine articular chondrocytes was isolated by the acidified guanidine isothiocyanate method and the levels of c-fos mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis. Denatured RNA samples (12 &mgr;g) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a denaturing 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), cross-linked with an ultraviolet cross-linker (Stratagene UV stratalinker 1800), and hybridized with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled rat c-fos DNA. mRNA for tubulin and total RNA were used as controls.

<paragraph id="P-0502" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0502&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel is capable of inhibiting collagenase production by chondrocytes in vitro at concentrations of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>M. This inhibition occurs downstream from the transcription factor activity of c-fos, but still represents a secondary gene response, as collagenase mRNA production is affected. As such, paclitaxel inhibition of collagenase production is not strictly due to interruption of the microtubules involved in the protein secretory pathway (which is dependent upon microtubular function for the movement of secretory granules), but acts at the level of the gene response to stimulation of collagenase production. Regardless of the mechanism of action, paclitaxel is capable of inhibiting collagenase production by at least one cell type known to produce this enzyme in the arthritic disease process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0503" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0503&rsqb;</number> While it is important that a disease modifying agent be capable of strongly inhibiting a variety of inappropriate cellular activities (proliferation, inflammation, proteolytic enzyme production) which occur in excess during the development of RA, it must not be toxic to the normal joint tissue. It is particularly critical that normal chondrocytes not be damaged, as this would hasten the destruction of the articular cartilage and lead to progression of the disease. In this example, the effect of paclitaxel on normal chondrocyte viability in vitro was examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0504" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0504&rsqb;</number> Briefly, chondrocytes were incubated in the presence (10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>M, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>M, and 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>M) or absence (control) of paclitaxel for 72 hours.

<heading lvl="1">Ophthalmic Drops Contain Ng Paclitaxel or Prednisolone Acetate </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0506" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0506&rsqb;</number> Three formulations containing 0.3% paclitaxel for ophthalmic use were prepared. The particle size distribution of paclitaxel as received from a supplier was not within acceptable limits for ophthalmic use. In particular, for ophthalmic drops at least 90% of the particles should preferably be below 10 &mgr;m, with no particle above 20 &mgr;m. Two methods were used to reduce the particle size. The first method involved precipitating paclitaxel from its solution in acetone. Briefly, 150 mg of paclitaxel was dissolved in 5 ml of acetone. This solution was added in a gentle stream, with stirring, to 20 ml of Sterile water USP to precipitate the drug. The suspension was homogenized with the Dounce homogenizer until about 90% of the drug was under 10 &mgr;m. The suspension was allowed to stand for about 1 hour. The larger particles settled and were separated from the smaller ones by decantation. The larger particles were again reduced until all particles were under 20 &mgr;m (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). This suspension was added to the one previously decanted and the acetone was evaporated by heating at 50&deg; C. for 2 hours and then in a vacuum oven at 30&deg; C. and 25 torr overnight to remove the residual acetone. Sodium chloride (0.45 g) was dissolved in 5 ml Sterile water USP. This solution and 20 ml of 5% PVA solution were mixed with the paclitaxel suspension, made up to 50 ml with sterile water and bottled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0507" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0507&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel suspension (0.3%) was also prepared by adding 150 mg of paclitaxel to 10 ml of sterile water and comminuted using the Fritsch Pulverizer for 15 minutes. It was not possible to produce particles lower than 60 &mgr;m with this method probably because the solid paclitaxel was not hard and brittle (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>). The suspension was mixed with 5 ml sterile water containing 0.45 g of NaCl and 20 ml of 5% PVA solution and made up to 50 ml with sterile water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0508" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0508&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel microspheres containing 10% paclitaxel in PCL were also prepared. Briefly, paclitaxel (60 mg) and PCL (540 mg) were dissolved in 3 ml of DCM, 20 ml of 3% PVA solution was added and homogenized with the Polytron homogenizer at point 3 setting for about 1 minute. The emulsion was poured into a 30 ml beaker and stirred until the microspheres were formed (about 3 hours). This suspension was placed in a vacuum oven, at 30&deg; C. and 25 torr, overnight to remove residual DCM. The small microsphere suspension (15 ml) was decanted and evaporated under vacuum to about 5 ml and assayed for paclitaxel. This suspension was mixed with 2 ml solution of NaCl (0.45 g) solution and made up to 10 ml with sterile water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0509" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0509&rsqb;</number> Prednisolone acetate suspension containing 1% drug was prepared by homogenizing the appropriate amount of the drug (as received) in 20 ml of 5% PVA, NaCl solution was added and made up to volume with sterile water. </paragraph>

Briefly, rabbits are anesthetized with a subcutaneous injection of 0.15 cc of a 1:1 mixture of ketamine (80 mg/ml) and xylazine (4 mg/ml), and the eyes cauterized by applying the tip of a new silver-potassium nitrate applicator (75% silver nitrate: 25% potassium nitrate; Graham-Field, Hauppage, N.Y.) 3 to 4 millimeters from the corneo-scleral limbus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0516" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0516&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, depending on the desired therapeutic effect, either quick release or slow release polymeric carriers may be desired. For example, polycaprolactone (PCL) and mixtures of PCL with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) produce compositions which release paclitaxel over a period of several months. In particular, the diffusion of paclitaxel in the polymers is very slow due to its large molecular size and extreme hydrophobicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0517" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0517&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, low molecular weight poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) gives fast degradation, ranging from one day to a few months depending on its initial molecular weight. The release of paclitaxel, in this case, is dominated by polymer degradation. Another feature of low molecular weight PDLLA is its low melting temperature, (i.e., 40&deg; C.-60&deg; C.), which makes it suitable material for making Thermopaste. As described in more detail below, several different methods can be utilized in order to control the polymer degradation rate, including, for example, by changing molecular weight of the PDLLA, and/or by mixing it with high mol wt. PCL, PDLLA, or poly(lactide-co-glyocide) (PLGA). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0533" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0533&rsqb;</number> Low molecular weight PDLLA 40 min was a soft material with light yellow color. The color is perhaps due to the oxidation during the polycondensation. Low molecular weight PDLLA 120 min (yellow) and 160 min (brown) were brittle solids at room temperature. They all become melts at 60&deg; C. Mixtures of 50:50 high molecular weight PDLLA or PLGA with low molecular weight PDLLA 40 min also melted about 60&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0534" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0534&rsqb;</number> During the release, low molecular weight PDLLA 40 min and 120 min broke up into fragments within one day, other materials were intact up to this writing (3 days). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0540" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0540&rsqb;</number> Neutrophil activation levels were determined by the generation of reactive oxygen species as determined by chemiluminescence. In particular, chemiluminescence was determined by using an LKB luminometer with 1 uM luminol enhancer.

<paragraph id="P-0541" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0541&rsqb;</number> Microspheres were then washed in 1 ml of HBSS and the centrifuged microsphere pellet added to the neutrophil suspension at 37&deg; C. at time t&equals;0.

<paragraph id="P-0543" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0543&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> shows that the untreated microspheres give chemiluminescence values less than 50 mV. These values represent low levels of neutrophil activation. By way of comparison, inflammatory microcrystals might give values close to 1000 mV, soluble chemical activators might give values close to 5000 mV. However, when the microspheres are precoated with plasma, all chemiluminescence values are amplified to the 100 to 300 mV range (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference>). These levels of neutrophil response or activation can be considered mildly inflammatory. PMMA gave the biggest response and could be regarded as the most inflammatory. PLA and PCL both become three to four times more potent in activating neutrophils after plasma pretreatment (or opsonization) but there is little difference between the two polymers in this regard. EVA:PLA is not likely to be used in angiogenesis formulations since the microspheres are difficult to dry and resuspend in aqueous buffer. This effect of plasma is termed opsonization and results from the adsorption of antibodies or complement molecules onto the surface. These adsorbed species interact with receptors on white blood cells and cause an amplified cell activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0544" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0544&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> describe the effects of plasma precoating of PCL, PMMA, PLA and EVA:PLA respectively as well as showing the effect of pluronic F127 precoating prior to plasma precoating of microspheres. These figures all show the same effect: (1) plasma precoating amplifies the response; (2) Pluronic F127 precoating has no effect on its own; (3) the amplified neutrophil response caused by plasma precoating can be strongly inhibited by pretreating the microsphere surface with 2% pluronic F127. </paragraph>

Using this method, it was shown that pretreating the polymeric surface with Pluronic F127 inhibited the adsorption of antibodies to the polymeric surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0546" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0546&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> likewise show the effect of precoating PCL, PMMA, PLA or EVA:PLA microspheres (respectively) with either IgG (2 mg/ml) or 2% pluronic F127 then IgG (2 mg/ml). As can be seen from these figures, the amplified response caused by precoating microspheres with IgG can be inhibited by treatment with pluronic F127. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0547" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0547&rsqb;</number> This result shows that by pretreating the polymeric surface of all four types of microspheres with Pluronic F127, the &ldquo;inflammatory&rdquo; response of neutrophils to microspheres may be inhibited. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0568" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0568&rsqb;</number> In summary, based on the above experiments it can be concluded that the addition of MePEG makes the polymer less brittle and more wax like, reduces the melting point and increases the solidification time of the polymer. All these factors improve the application properties of the paste. At low concentrations (20%) MePEG has no effect on the release of paclitaxel from PCL. Gamma-irradiation appears to have little effect on paclitaxel release. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Insertion of Control and Paclitaxel Coated Stents into Microswine </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0600" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0600&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, various tubes within the body can be occluded by disease processes. One method for treating such occlusion is to insert an endoluminal stent within the tube in order to relieve the obstruction. Unfortunately, the stents themselves are often overgrown by epithelial cells, thus limiting the duration and effectiveness of the treatment. As described in more detail below, stainless steel stents were coated with paclitaxel-loaded EVA polymer and placed into the biliary duct of microswine in order to assess prevention of benign epithelial overgrowth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0601" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0601&rsqb;</number> A. Materials and Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0602" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0602&rsqb;</number> Yucatan microswine were placed under general anesthetic and a 5 cm transverse upper abdominal incision performed. The gallbladder was grasped and sewn to the anterior abdominal wall and a tiny incision was made in the gallbladder fundus. A <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F catheter was inserted into the gallbladder and radiopaque contrast injected to outline the biliary tree. A hydrophilic guidewire was advanced through the cystic duct into the common bile duct, and over this a <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>F (purpose&mdash;built, reusable) delivery catheter containing a stainless steel (5 mm diameter&times;4.2 cm long) was advanced and deployed in the common bile duct. The delivery catheter was withdrawn into the gallbladder and a repeat cholangiogram performed. The gallbladder incision was closed, a radiopaque staple was fixed at the incision site, and then the abdominal incision was closed. The swine was randomized into groups of receiving uncoated stents, polymer coated stents, and paclitaxel-loaded (33%) polymer coated stents. Tantalum (strecker) stainless steel stents and stainless steel Wallstents were used for each of these studies. Swines from each group were sacrificed at 14, 28, 56, and 112 days post-stent insertion by injecting Euthanyl. After sacrifice, the gallbladder was cannulated percutaneously under X-ray by puncturing at the staple and radiopaque contrast injected to outline the biliary tree. X-rays were taken and analyzed for narrowing at or adjacent to the stent. The liver and biliary tree were removed en bloc. The portion of bile duct containing the stent was sectioned transversely at 1 cm intervals and the histologic sections were used to assess the degree of overgrowth of the stent. The liver was also examined histologically for signs of chronic obstruction or inflammation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0603" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0603&rsqb;</number> B. Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0604" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0604&rsqb;</number> Control, uncoated stainless steel stents were inserted into microswine as described above, and sacrificed at various times. At two weeks, the bile mucosa appeared normal in 2 of the sacrificed pigs, while one presented a small non-obstructive bile concretion within the biliary lumen, and a slight indentation in the bile duct mucosa at the site of the tines. At 4 weeks, of the 3 pigs which were sacrificed a small bile concretion was present on the distal stent, as well as mucosal indentations of the stent tine within the bile duct mucosa. At 8 weeks, the bile duct mucosa at the site of stent insertion in the sacrificed pigs partially overgrew the stent tines in a crescentic manner over approximately 25-30% of the radius of the stent (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 65A, 66A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>B). In addition, one pig contained thick bile containing inflammatory cells within the lumen. At 16 weeks, pigs which were sacrificed presented a stent which was completely overgrown distally by fibrous tissue, and no evidence of a lumen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65B</cross-reference>). Histologically, the tissue was uniformly fibrous. Surprisingly, the liver biopsy of all of the control treated swines were normal and there was no evidence of obstructive changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0605" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0605&rsqb;</number> In another group of microswine, stents coated with ethylene vinyl acetate and 33% paclitaxel were inserted into the biliary duct. After an 8 week exposure, one pig was sacrificed and showed a slight indentation of the bile duct mucosa at the site of the stent tines and no indication of overgrowth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66C and 66D</cross-reference>). The underlying mucosa was normal apart from some inflammatory cell infiltration. Non-obstructive bile concretions were noted in the lumen of the stent. The liver biopsy was normal, with no evidence of obstructive changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0606" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0606&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.  </paragraph>
