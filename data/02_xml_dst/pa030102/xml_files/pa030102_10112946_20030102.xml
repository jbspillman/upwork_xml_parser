<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an antenna element for use in reception or transmission of radio waves, and more particularly, to an antenna element which has conductors formed on its outer surfaces of a device substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At present, radio communication apparatuses called a mobile telephone and the like are pervasive in general users, and a reduction in size and weight is required for the radio communication apparatuses. The radio communication apparatus receives and transmits radio waves through an antenna element, where the total length of a conductive path is closely related to the wavelength of a radio wave transmitted or received thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For this reason, since a simple reduction in the length of the conductive path causes a rise in the resonant frequency, difficulties are encountered in efficiently radio communicating a radio wave at a predetermined frequency. To address this problem, a variety of techniques have been devised for reducing the shape of an overall antenna element while maintaining a required resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, an antenna element called a helical antenna has a conductive path formed in a spiral shape, while an antenna element called a meander antenna has a conductive path in a meandering shape. While these antennas do not achieve a reduction in the total length of the conductive path, the overall shape can be substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is also an antenna element called a dielectric antenna which has a conductive path formed on the surface of a dielectric material to reduce the length of the conductive path. Since the wavelength of a radio wave is reduced within a member having a high dielectric constant or permeability, the formation of the conductive path on or within a dielectric material or a magnetic material results in a reduction in the total length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Moreover, there is an antenna element called a loaded antenna which adds a reactance element, an inductance element or a capacitance element to a conductive path to reduce the length of the conductive path. It should be understood that a variety of foregoing techniques may be combined, for example, to create an antenna element which has a conductive path formed in a helical shape or in a meander shape on the surface of a dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An antenna element can be made compact by a variety of techniques as described above. However, in the helical antenna and meander antenna, a long conductive path is bent to reduce the area occupied thereby, so that adjacent portions of the conductive path are electromagnetically coupled to cause an increase in surface current and high frequency loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To solve the problem as mentioned, the present inventor invented an antenna element which has a conductive path formed in a shape different from the helical shape or meander shape on the surface of a dielectric material, and filed the invention as Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-026002. This application discloses an antenna element which has a first conductor and a second conductor, parallel to each other, connected by a short-circuit conductor to form a loaded inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the antenna element disclosed in the application will be described below in brief, as a related art which precedes the present invention and is not known. The antenna element described below was filed in Japan on Feb. 1, 2001 as Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-026002, and filed in the United States of America on Jan. 31, 2002 as U.S. Ser. No. 10/059423 by the present inventor. However, this application has not been opened in any country, so that this is not a prior art but merely a related art of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Antenna element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the aforementioned application has device substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> made of a dielectric material in rectangular solid, and conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed of a printed wire on the front surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to implement a dielectric antenna as described above. Conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is comprised of power supply conductor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, short-circuit conductor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More specifically, power supply conductor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> comprises a linear portion formed from the bottom surface to front surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, while first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a linear portion formed from an upper end or terminate end of power supply conductor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and bent at a right angle to the right in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Short-circuit conductor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> comprises a linear portion formed from a right end or terminate end of first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and bent upward at a right angle in the figure, i.e., in the opposite direction to power supply conductor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, while second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprises a linear portion formed from an upper end or terminate end of short-circuit conductor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and bent at a right angle to the left in the figure, and positioned in parallel with first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In antenna element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the structure as described, conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be reduced in length since first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, positioned in parallel with each other, act as a loaded inductance. In addition, since conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is generally bent in a U-shape (which has three straight lines forming two right angles), the overall shape can be made compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Unlike the meander antenna, helical antenna and the like, in spite of the reduction in size, first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, positioned in parallel with each other, are sufficiently spaced away from each other, so that their electromagnetic coupling is reduced, thereby making it possible to realize radio communications with high gain, high efficiency and wide band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Antenna element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the structure described above presents a rise in the resonant frequency as the overall shape is simply reduced in shape, whereas the resonant frequency is reduced as the loaded inductance is increased. In other words, when the resonant frequency is maintained constant, an increase in the loaded inductance can result in a relative reduction in the size of the overall shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The loaded inductance of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the aforementioned antenna element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be increased by spacing first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> away from each other, reducing the width of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, extending the length of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as first/second conductors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, for spacing first conductor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> away from each other, device substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> must be extended, resulting in an increased size of the overall shape. The width of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a lower limit determined by a thermal condition, and a reduction in the width of the conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will cause a reduced bandwidth and an increased high frequency loss, so that the width of conductive path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> cannot be reduced without prudence. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a antenna element which is made compact, and has a first conductor and a second conductor positioned in parallel with each other and connected through a short-circuit conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The antenna element according to the present invention has a first conductor, a short-circuit conductor, a second conductor, and a device substrate. The device substrate is made of at least one of a dielectric material and a magnetic material, and is formed with the first conductor, short-circuit conductor and second conductor on its outer surface. The first conductor is made of a linear conductor supplied with electric power at a leading end thereof, while the short-circuit conductor is connected perpendicularly to a terminate end of the first conductor. The second conductor is connected at a right angle to a terminate end of the short-circuit conductor and positioned in parallel with the first conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect of the antenna element described above, an extended portion bent in a U-shape is formed in at least one of the first conductor and the second conductor. In a second aspect, the first conductor and second conductor are formed continuously on a plurality of outer surfaces of the device substrate. In a third aspect, the first conductor and second conductor are formed continuously on a plurality of outer surfaces of the device substrate, and an extended portion bent in a U-shape is formed in at least one of the first conductor and second conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Thus, the antenna element of the present invention can extend the conductive path without increasing the size of the device substrate even though the parallel first conductor and second conductor are connected through the short-circuit conductor on the outer surface of the device substrate. It is therefore possible to reduce the size of the device substrate without relatively extending the conductive path, and reduce the size of the overall shape while ensuring a desired resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In another implementation of the antenna element as described above, a power supply conductor is also formed as part of the conductive path. The power supply conductor has a terminate end connected at a right angle to the leading end of the first conductor, and positioned on the opposite side to the short-circuit conductor. By supplying electric power to a leading end of the power supply conductor, the electric power can be supplied to the first conductor from the power supply conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Since the first conductor and second conductor are formed from the front surface to the back surface across one side surface of the device substrate formed in rectangular solid, the conductive path can be extended, effectively making use of a plurality of outer surfaces of the solid device substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Since the first conductor is formed at different positions on the front surface and rear surface of the device substrate, a portion of the first conductor positioned on the front surface of the device substrate can be spaced apart from a portion of the first conductor positioned on the back surface to reduce a distributed capacitance, thereby making it possible to prevent a reduction in the bandwidth of communication frequencies due to accumulation of unwanted electromagnetic energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Since the second conductor is formed at different positions on the front surface and rear surface of the device substrate, a portion of the second conductor positioned on the front surface of the device substrate can be spaced apart from a portion of the second conductor positioned on the back surface to reduce a distributed capacitance, thereby making it possible to prevent a reduction in the bandwidth of communication frequencies due to accumulation of unwanted electromagnetic energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also, by virtue of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> a conductive pathar connection of a leading end of the extended portion formed and connected to the leading end of the first conductor to a terminate end of the power supply conductor; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> a linear connection of a terminate end of the extended portion formed and connected to the terminate end of the first conductor to a leading end of the short-circuit conductor; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> a linear connection of the leading end of the extended portion formed and connected to the leading end of the second conductor to a terminate end of the short-circuit conductor; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> a linear connection of the terminate end of the extended portion formed and connected to the terminate end of the second conductor to a leading end of a connection conductor, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> the shape can be simplified, even though the conductive path is extended, thus making it possible to improve the productivity of the antenna element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since a capacitive conductor having a given capacitance is connected to the terminate end of the second conductor, the conductive path can be reduced in length due to a capacitance load of the capacitive conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Since the second conductor is formed integrally with a capacitive conductor of a given capacitance, the conductive path is reduced in length due to a capacitance load of the capacitive conductor. Since the capacitive conductor and second conductor need not be separately formed and connected to each other through a connection conductor, it is possible to simplify the structure to improve the productivity, and reduce the size of the overall shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Since a resonant circuit is formed of a resonant conductor formed at a predetermined position of at least one of the first conductor and second conductor to the vicinity of the other one, the resonant circuit permits the antenna element to support radio communications at a plurality of frequencies, making it possible to improve the performance of the antenna element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Since a plurality of resonant conductors are connected respectively to at least one of the first conductor and second conductor, a plurality of resonant circuits resonate at different frequencies from one another, permitting the antenna element to support radio communications at a plurality of frequencies and at frequencies in a wide band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A radio communication apparatus according to the present invention, with the provision of the antenna element of the present invention, can radio communicate a radio wave at a desired frequency through the small antenna element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from-the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In radio communication apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is mounted on an upper half of the front surface of circuit board <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> on which ground electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is not formed. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a leading end connected to a terminate end of power supply electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing structure, antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is similar to the aforementioned antenna element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in that first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, positioned in parallel with each other, act as a loaded inductance, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, so that the length of conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is reduced to make the overall shape smaller, while ensuring a desired resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Unlike the meander antenna, helical antenna and the like, however, since first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> positioned in parallel to each other are sufficiently spaced away from each other, their electromagnetic coupling is reduced, making it possible to realize radio communications with high gain, high efficiency, and wide band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Further, since capacitive conductor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is connected to a terminate end of conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, this capacitive conductor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has a large capacitance between ground electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and itself. For this reason, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, an equivalent circuit of antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is represented by an LC series circuit, with a reduced resonant frequency, so that conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be relatively reduced further in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since antenna element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this embodiment has extended portion <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> formed in first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is extended without increasing the size of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In other words, device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is made compact without relatively extending conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so that the overall shape is made compact while ensuring a desired resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As described above, since first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are sufficiently spaced away from each other, the formation of extended portion <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will not cause strong electromagnetic coupling with second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, so that antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment can provide good radio communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, in antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, extended portion <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> formed in first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is connected in linear fashion to power supply conductor <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, so that the shape of antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be simplified while extending conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, thereby making antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> highly productive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As appreciated, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment, and permits a variety of alterations without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, while antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the foregoing embodiment illustrates that extended portion <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> formed at the leading end of first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is connected in a linear fashion to power supply conductor <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the foregoing structure can be recognized as well in such a manner that an extended portion formed at the terminate end of first conductor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is connected in a linear fashion to short-circuit conductor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as antenna element <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, extended portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be formed at the terminate end of second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and connected in a linear fashion to connection conductor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and this structure can be recognized as well in such a manner that an extended portion formed at the leading end of second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is connected in a linear fashion to short-circuit conductor <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, while antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the foregoing embodiment illustrates that capacitive conductor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is formed on second conductor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by connection conductor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, second conductor <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> can be formed integral with a capacitive conductor, as antenna element <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Alternatively, antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may not be formed either with capacitive conductor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> or with connection conductor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, while antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the foregoing embodiment illustrates that conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is formed on its outer surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, some antenna element (not shown) has a dielectric material integrally laminated on the outer surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, on which conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is thus formed, to form an element member. In this structure, even though conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is positioned inside the element member made of the dielectric material, device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is still positioned inside the element member, with conductive path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> positioned on the outer surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, as is the case with antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment, though device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is formed in rectangular solid just like the aforementioned antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the like, antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> differs from the aforementioned antenna element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the like in that first conductor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> of conductive path <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are formed continuously from the front surface to one side surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing structure, antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment can extend first conductor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> without increasing the size of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, so that the overall shape can be made compact while maintaining a desired resonant frequency. Particularly, since a plurality of outer surfaces of solid device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are effectively utilized to extend first/second conductors <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, first/second conductors <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can be extended as appropriate while they are sufficiently spaced away from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As appreciated, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing second embodiment, and permits a variety of alterations without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, while antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment illustrates that first/second conductors <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are formed continuously on a plurality of outer surfaces of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the aforementioned extended portions <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be formed in first/second conductors <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> which are continuously formed on a plurality of outer surfaces of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in the foregoing manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, while antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment illustrates that first conductor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are formed continuously from the front surface to the side surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, first conductor <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and second conductor <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may be continuously formed from the front surface to the back surface across one side surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, for example, as antenna element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, to further extend first/second conductors <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to relatively reduce the size of the overall shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It should be noted however that in the foregoing antenna element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, portions of first/second conductors <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> positioned on the front surface and the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are in close proximity to and in parallel with each other, giving rise to a concern of an increased distributed capacitance to reduce the bandwidth of radio communications. Thus, if the reduction in bandwidth is unacceptable, first and second conductors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> are preferably inclined in opposite directions on one side surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to form first and second conductors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> at different positions on the front surface and rear surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, as antenna element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this structure, since the portions of first/second conductors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> positioned on the front surface and the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are spaced away from each other, the distributed capacitance can be reduced to extend the bandwidth of radio communication. Alternatively, even when first/second conductors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> are inclined in the same direction on the side surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (not shown), first/second conductors <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be formed at different positions on the front surface and the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to reduce the distributed capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Further, while antenna element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment illustrates that power supply conductor <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is also formed integrally with conductive path <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> drawn on a plurality of outer surfaces of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, no power supply conductor may be formed together with conductive path <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> drawn continuously on a plurality of outer surfaces of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, as antenna element <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Antenna element <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is formed with first/second conductors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> of conductive path <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> from the front surface to the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and connections <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> are formed at a leading end of first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and at a terminate end of second conductor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight>, positioned on the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Then, in radio communication apparatus <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> utilizing antenna element <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, a pair of connections <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> are formed for connection with respective connections <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> on the front surface of circuit board <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> opposite to the back surface of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and power supply electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is connected to one of connections <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> connected to first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Because of the elimination of the need for forming a power supply conductor in conductive path <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>, antenna element <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> as described above is simple in structure and highly productive. Moreover, since first/second conductors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> can be disposed at both ends of device substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the whole element can be further made compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as antenna element <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> may be formed at a predetermined position of at least one of first/second conductors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> to the vicinity of the other one, such that a resonant circuit is formed of this resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> to support radio communications at a plurality of frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While in antenna element <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, a terminate end of resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> having a leading end connected to second conductor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> is positioned near first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, a sufficient inductance can be generated because resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> is linear near the leading end and meandering near the terminate end. In addition, since resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> has a terminate end formed in parallel with first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, a sufficient capacitance can be generated as well, thereby providing a satisfactory resonant circuit formed of resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> and first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Also, while resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> has a leading end connected to second conductor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> and a terminate end positioned near first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> may have the leading end connected to first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and the terminate end positioned near second conductor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> (not shown), in which case the terminate ends of a pair of resonant conductors, which have the leading ends connected to first/second conductors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight>, respectively, can be placed in close proximity (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Further, while antenna element <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates resonant conductor <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> which is meandering near the terminate end and parallel with first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> near the leading end, the present invention can be implemented as well in an antenna element which has a resonant conductor (not shown) not formed in a meander shape, a resonant conductor (not shown) with a terminate end portion not in parallel with first conductor <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as antenna element <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> plurality of resonant conductors <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> can be connected one by one at a plurality of positions on second conductor <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight>. In such antenna element <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, since a plurality of resonant circuits formed of the plurality of resonant conductors <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> differ in resonant frequency from one another, antenna element <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can support radio communications at a plurality of frequencies. Further, when the plurality of frequencies are close to one another, communication frequencies can be virtually provided in a wide band. </paragraph>
