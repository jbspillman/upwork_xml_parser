<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to radio frequency (RF) switches. More specifically, the present invention relates to RF micro-magnetic latching switches with magnetic and electrostatic actuation mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Switches are typically electrically controlled two-state devices that open and close contacts to effect operation of devices in an electrical or optical circuit. Relays, for example, typically function as switches that activate or de-activate portions of electrical, optical or other devices. Relays are commonly used in many applications including telecommunications, radio frequency (RF) communications, portable electronics, consumer and industrial electronics, aerospace, and other systems. More recently, optical switches (also referred to as &ldquo;optical relays&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;relays&rdquo; herein) have been used to switch optical signals (such as those in optical communication systems) from one path to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although the earliest relays were mechanical or solid-state devices, recent developments in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies and microelectronics manufacturing have made micro-electrostatic and micro-magnetic relays possible. Such micro-magnetic relays typically include an electromagnet that energizes an armature to make or break an electrical contact. When the magnet is de-energized, a spring or other mechanical force typically restores the armature to a quiescent position. Such relays typically exhibit a number of marked disadvantages, however, in that they generally exhibit only a single stable output (i.e., the quiescent state) and they are not latching (i.e., they do not retain a constant output as power is removed from the relay). Moreover, the spring required by conventional micro-magnetic relays may degrade or break over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another micro-magnetic relay is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,631, (the &apos;631 patent) issued to Taylor et al. on Dec. 8, 1998, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The relay disclosed in this patent includes a permanent magnet and an electromagnet for generating a magnetic field that intermittently opposes the field generated by the permanent magnet. The relay must consume power in the electromagnet to maintain at least one of the output states. Moreover, the power required to generate the opposing field would be significant, thus making the relay less desirable for use in space, portable electronics, and other applications that demand low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The basic elements of a micro-magnetic latching switch include a permanent magnet, a substrate, a coil, and a cantilever at least partially made of soft magnetic materials. In its optimal configuration, the permanent magnet produces a static magnetic field that is relatively perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the cantilever. However, the magnetic field lines produced by a permanent magnet with a typical regular shape (disk, square, etc.) are not necessarily perpendicular to a plane, especially at the edge of the magnet. Then, any horizontal component of the magnetic field due to the permanent magnet can either eliminate one of the bistable states, or greatly increase the current that is needed to switch the cantilever from one state to the other. Careful alignment of the permanent magnet relative to the cantilever so as to locate the cantilever in the right spot of the permanent magnet field (usually near the center) will permit bi-stability and minimize switching current. Nevertheless, high-volume production of the switch can become difficult and costly if the alignment error tolerance is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> What is desired is a latching switch usable for RF signal applications. Such a switch should also be reliable, simple in design, low-cost and easy to manufacture, and should be useful in a variety of environments. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Micro-machined RF switches having enhanced electrical and mechanical characteristics are described. The micro-machined RF switches include a substrate, a moveable micro-machined cantilever supported by the substrate, and an actuation mechanism that causes the cantilever to switch between two or more states. In one aspect, in a first state, a conducting layer of the cantilever couples a RF transmission line to a reference signal. In a second state, the conducting layer does not couple the RF transmission line to the reference signal. In further states, the conducting layer can couple one or more additional RF transmission lines to respective reference signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a micro-machined RF switch with an electromagnetic actuation mechanism. A moveable micro-machined cantilever is supported by a substrate. The cantilever has a magnetic material and a longitudinal axis. The cantilever also has a conducting layer. A first permanent magnet produces a first magnetic field. The first magnetic field induces a magnetization in the magnetic material. The magnetization is characterized by a magnetization vector pointing in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the cantilever. The first magnetic field is approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. An electromagnet produces a second magnetic field to switch the cantilever between a first stable state and a second stable state. A temporary current through the electromagnet produces the second magnetic field such that a component of the second magnetic field parallel to the longitudinal axis changes direction of the magnetization vector, thereby causing the movable element to switch between the first stable state and the second stable state. In the first stable state, the conducting layer couples a RF transmission line to a reference signal. In the second stable state, the conducting layer does not couple the RF transmission line to the reference signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the RF switch includes a torsion spring that supports the cantilever on the substrate. The torsion spring flexes to allow the cantilever to move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, in the second stable state, the conducting layer couples a second RF transmission line to a second reference signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, in the first stable state, a first portion of the conducting layer connects the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal, and in the second stable state, a second portion of the conducting layer connects the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a first portion of the cantilever flexes to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer, and/or a second portion of the cantilever flexes to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the cantilever includes a first angled portion to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer, and/or the cantilever includes a second angled portion to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect, the present invention is directed to a micro-machined RF switch with an electrostatic actuation mechanism. A moveable micro-machined cantilever is supported by a substrate. The cantilever has a conducting layer. The cantilever is switchable to at least a first state and a second state. A gate metal is formed on a surface of the substrate proximate to the conducing layer. A voltage applied to the gate metal produces an electrostatic attraction between the gate metal and the conducting layer. The cantilever is thereby caused to switch to the first stable state. In the first state, the conducting layer couples a RF transmission line to a reference signal. In the second state, the reference signal is decoupled from the first RF transmission line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a second gate metal is formed on a surface of the substrate proximate to the conducting layer, on a side of the torsion spring opposite the first gate metal. A voltage applied to the second gate metal produces an electrostatic attraction between the second gate metal and the conducting layer. The cantilever is thereby caused to switch to a third state. In the third state, the conducting layer couples a second RF transmission line to a second reference signal. In the second state, the conducting layer is decoupled from the first and second RF transmission lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a first portion of the cantilever flexes to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer, and/or a second portion of the cantilever flexes to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the cantilever includes a first angled portion to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer, and/or the cantilever includes a second angled portion to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The micro-magnetic latching switches of the present invention can be used in a plethora of products including household and industrial appliances, consumer electronics, military hardware, medical devices and vehicles of all types, just to name a few broad categories of goods. The micro-magnetic latching switches of the present invention have the advantages of compactness, simplicity of fabrication, and have good performance at high frequencies, which lends them to many novel applications in many RF applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, advantages and features will become readily apparent in view of the following detailed description of the invention. </paragraph>

Materials such as doped polysilicon, doped single-crystal silicon (often referred to simply as diffusion, regardless of whether such doping is achieved by thermal diffusion or ion implantation), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), and refractory metal suicides are examples of other conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The terms contact and via, both refer to structures for electrical connection of conductors from different interconnect levels. These terms are sometimes used in the art to describe both an opening in an insulator in which the structure will be completed, and the completed structure itself.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> show side and top views, respectively, of a latching switch. The terms switch and device are used herein interchangeably to described the structure of the present invention. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, an exemplary latching relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> suitably includes a magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> housing a conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a cantilever (moveable element) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> positioned or supported above substrate by a staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is any type of magnet such as a permanent magnet, an electromagnet, or any other type of magnet capable of generating a magnetic field H<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as described more fully below. By way of example and not limitation, the magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be a model 59-P09213T001 magnet available from the Dexter Magnetic Technologies corporation of Fremont, Calif., although of course other types of magnets could be used. Magnetic field <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be generated in any manner and with any magnitude, such as from about 1 Oersted to 10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Oersted or more. The strength of the field depends on the force required to hold the cantilever in a given state, and thus is implementation dependent. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, magnetic field H<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be generated approximately parallel to the Z axis and with a magnitude on the order of about 370 Oersted, although other embodiments will use varying orientations and magnitudes for magnetic field <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In various embodiments, a single magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be used in conjunction with a number of relays <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> sharing a common substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed of any type of substrate material such as silicon, gallium arsenide, glass, plastic, metal or any other substrate material. In various embodiments, substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be coated with an insulating material (such as an oxide) and planarized or otherwise made flat. In various embodiments, a number of latching relays <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can share a single substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other devices (such as transistors, diodes, or other electronic devices) could be formed upon substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> along with one or more relays <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using, for example, conventional integrated circuit manufacturing techniques. Alternatively, magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> could be used as a substrate and the additional components discussed below could be formed directly on magnet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In such embodiments, a separate substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may not be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed of any material such as oxide or another insulator such as a thin-film insulator. In an exemplary embodiment, insulating layer is formed of Probimide 7510 material. Insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> suitably houses conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> to be a single conductor having two ends <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> arranged in a coil pattern. Alternate embodiments of conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> use single or multiple conducting segments arranged in any suitable pattern such as a meander pattern, a serpentine pattern, a random pattern, or any other pattern. Conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is formed of any material capable of conducting electricity such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or the like. As conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> conducts electricity, a magnetic field is generated around conductor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as discussed more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Cantilever (moveable element) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is any armature, extension, outcropping or member that is capable of being affected by magnetic force. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> suitably includes a magnetic layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and a conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Magnetic layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be formulated of permalloy (such as NiFe alloy) or any other magnetically sensitive material. Conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be formulated of gold, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or any other conducting material. In various embodiments, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> exhibits two states corresponding to whether relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed&rdquo;, as described more fully below. In many embodiments, relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is said to be &ldquo;closed&rdquo; when a conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, connects staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the relay may be said to be &ldquo;open&rdquo; when cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not in electrical contact with contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Because cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can physically move in and out of contact with contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, various embodiments of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will be made flexible so that cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can bend as appropriate. Flexibility can be created by varying the thickness of the cantilever (or its various component layers), by patterning or otherwise making holes or cuts in the cantilever, or by using increasingly flexible materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be made into a &ldquo;hinged&rdquo; arrangement. Although of course the dimensions of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can vary dramatically from implementation to implementation, an exemplary cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> suitable for use in a micro-magnetic relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be on the order of 10-1000 microns in length, 1-40 microns in thickness, and 2-600 microns in width. For example, an exemplary cantilever in accordance with the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> can have dimensions of about 600 microns&times;10 microns&times;50 microns, or 1000 microns&times;600 microns&times;25 microns, or any other suitable dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are placed on insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as appropriate. In various embodiments, staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> supports cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> above insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, creating a gap <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that can be vacuum or can become filled with air or another gas or liquid such as oil. Although the size of gap <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> varies widely with different implementations, an exemplary gap <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> can be on the order of 1-100 microns, such as about 20 microns, Contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can receive cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when relay <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in a closed state, as described below. Contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be formed of any conducting material such as gold, gold alloy, silver, copper, aluminum, metal or the like. In various embodiments, contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed of similar conducting materials, and the relay is considered to be &ldquo;closed&rdquo; when cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> completes a circuit between staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and contact <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments wherein cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> does not conduct electricity, staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be formulated of non-conducting material such as Probimide material, oxide, or any other material. Additionally, alternate embodiments may not require staging layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> if cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is otherwise supported above insulating layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Principle of Operation of a Micro-Magnetic Latching Switch </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When it is in the &ldquo;down&rdquo; position, the cantilever makes electrical contact with the bottom conductor, and the switch is &ldquo;ON&rdquo; (also called the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; state). When the contact end is &ldquo;up&rdquo;, the switch is &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; (also called the &ldquo;open&rdquo; state). These two stable states produce the switching function by the moveable cantilever element. The permanent magnet holds the cantilever in either the &ldquo;up&rdquo; or the &ldquo;down&rdquo; position after switching, making the device a latching relay. A current is passed through the coil (e.g., the coil is energized) only during a brief (temporary) period of time to transition between the two states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (i) Method to Produce Bi-Stability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The principle by which bi-stability is produced is illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the length L of a permalloy cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is much larger than its thickness t and width (w, not shown), the direction along its long axis L becomes the preferred direction for magnetization (also called the &ldquo;easy axis&rdquo;). When a major central portion of the cantilever is placed in a uniform permanent magnetic field, a torque is exerted on the cantilever. The torque can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the initial orientation of the cantilever with respect to the magnetic field. When the angle (&agr;) between the cantilever axis (&xgr;) and the external field (H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) is smaller than 90&deg;, the torque is counterclockwise; and when a is larger than 90&deg;, the torque is clockwise. The bi-directional torque arises because of the bi-directional magnetization (i.e., a magnetization vector &ldquo;m&rdquo; points one direction or the other direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the cantilever (m points from left to right when &agr;&lt;90&deg;, and from right to left when &agr;&gt;90&deg;). Due to the torque, the cantilever tends to align with the external magnetic field (H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>). However, when a mechanical force (such as the elastic torque of the cantilever, a physical stopper, etc.) preempts to the total realignment with H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, two stable positions (&ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo;) are available, which forms the basis of latching in the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (ii) Electrical Switching </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> If the bi-directional magnetization along the easy axis of the cantilever arising from H<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>can be momentarily reversed by applying a second magnetic field to overcome the influence of (H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>), then it is possible to achieve a switchable latching relay. This scenario is realized by situating a planar coil under or over the cantilever to produce the required temporary switching field. The planar coil geometry was chosen because it is relatively simple to fabricate, though other structures (such as a wrap-around, three dimensional type) are also possible. The magnetic field (Hcoil) lines generated by a short current pulse loop around the coil. It is mainly the &xgr;-component (along the cantilever, see FIG, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of this field that is used to reorient the magnetization (magnetization vector &ldquo;m&rdquo;) in the cantilever. The direction of the coil current determines whether a positive or a negative &xgr;-field component is generated. Plural coils can be used. After switching, the permanent magnetic field holds the cantilever in this state until the next switching event is encountered. Since the &xgr;-component of the coil-generated field (Hcoil-&xgr;) only needs to be momentarily larger than the &xgr;-component &lsqb;H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&xgr;&tilde;H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>cos(&agr;)&equals;H<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>sin(&phgr;), &agr;&equals;90&deg;-&phgr;&rsqb; of the permanent magnetic field and &phgr; is typically very small (e.g., &phgr;&lsim;5&deg;), switching current and power can be very low, which is an important consideration in micro relay design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The operation principle can be summarized as follows: A permalloy cantilever in a uniform (in practice, the field can be just approximately uniform) magnetic field can have a clockwise or a counterclockwise torque depending on the angle between its long axis (easy axis, L) and the field. Two bi-stable states are possible when other forces can balance die torque. A coil can generate a momentary magnetic field to switch the orientation of magnetization (vector m) along the cantilever and thus switch the cantilever between the two states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Relaxed Alignment of Magnets </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To address the issue of relaxing the magnet alignment requirement, the inventors have developed a technique to create perpendicular magnetic fields in a relatively large region around the cantilever. The invention is based on the fact that the magnetic field lines in a low permeability media (e.g., air) are basically perpendicular to the surface of a very high permeability material (e.g., materials that are easily magnetized, such as permalloy). When the cantilever is placed in proximity to such a surface and the cantilever&apos;s horizontal plane is parallel to the surface of the high permeability material, the above stated objectives can be at least partially achieved. The generic scheme is described below, followed by illustrative embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The boundary conditions for the magnetic flux density (B) and magnetic field (H) follow the following relationships: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If &mgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&gt;&gt;&mgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the normal component of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is much larger than the normal component of H<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the limit (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/&mgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&rarr;&infin;, the magnetic field H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is normal to the boundary surface, independent of the direction of H<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(barring the exceptional case of H<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>exactly parallel to the interface). If the second media is air (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;1), then B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;&mgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, so that the flux lines B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will also be perpendicular to the surface. This property is used to produce magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the cantilever in a micro-magnetic latching switch and to relax the permanent magnet alignment requirements. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, without a second magnetic layer, such as a high-permeability magnetic layer, the flux lines are less perpendicular to the horizontal plane, resulting in a large horizontal (x) component. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, when a second magnetic layer, such as a high-permeability magnetic layer, is introduced with its surface parallel to the horizontal plane, the magnetic flux lines are approximately perpendicular to the horizontal plane in a relatively large region. The region indicated by a box with dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is the preferred location of the switch, with the cantilever horizontal plane parallel to the horizontal axis (x). The features and advantages of this &ldquo;dipole&rdquo; arrangement for micro-magnetic latching switches are fully described in U.S. non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 10/051,447, filed Jan. 8, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-C show the extracted horizontal components (Bx) of the magnetic flux along cut-lines at various heights (y&equals;&minus;75 mm, &minus;25 mm, 25 mm . . . ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C correspond to case (a) single permanent magnet, (b) a permanent magnet with a high-permeability magnetic layer (thickness t&equals;100 mm), and another case where the high-permeability magnetic layer thickness is t&equals;25 mm. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, without the high-permeability magnetic layer, Bx increases rapidly away from the center. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, Bx is reduced from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, due to the use of the high-permeability magnetic layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows that a thinner high-m layer is less effective than the thicker one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This property, where the magnetic field is normal to the boundary surface of a high-permeability material, and the placement of the cantilever (i.e., soft magnetic) with its horizontal plane parallel to the surface of the high-permeability material, can be used in many different configurations to relax the permanent magnet alignment requirement. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The micro-machined RF switch of the present invention includes micro-machined cantilevers, transmission lines suitable for RF signal propagation, and various actuation mechanisms to engage the cantilever to contact the RF signal transmission lines. The cantilever is controlled to coupled and decouple the RF signal transmission lines to and from a reference signal to effectively turn the RF switch &ldquo;off&rdquo; and &ldquo;on.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C show high level views of a micro-machined RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, according to embodiments of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a top view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</cross-reference> show cross-sectional views of micro-machined RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C, micro-machined RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, and cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> bottom surface of cantilever assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, in an embodiment, co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and includes an RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> positioned between a first reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and a second reference signal <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, first reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and second reference signal <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> are ground lines, but may be coupled to other reference potential values. RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, first reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, and second reference signal <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> are preferably metal traces, or other structures that conduct RF signals, as described above. An RF signal is input to RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> at RF input <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The RF signal is conducted from RF input <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, through co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, to RF output <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, which is an RF signal output for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has two states. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows a first state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> shows a second state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> right end of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is rotated downward. Furthermore, conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> electrically couples (i.e., shorts) RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an RF signal cannot effectively propagate through RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Partial or total reflection of the RF signal from RF input <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is caused, and the first state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; state. In embodiments, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be used to couple RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to either one or both of first and second reference signals <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Note that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is bent or angled with respect the rest of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> may be preformed to have an angle with respect to the rest of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>). Alternatively, all of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or just cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, may flex or be flexible. Angling and/or flexing of cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> can be used to enhance the coupling of first reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> to RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. In this manner, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> is allowed to be more parallel to, or to conform more closely to substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> than the rest of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is situated at an angle to substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is rotated upward. Furthermore, conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not in contact with RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and/or with either of reference signals <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an RF signal can propagate through RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> with relatively little loss and reflection in RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Hence, the second state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The present invention is adaptable to numerous embodiments for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. For example, an RF signal can be conducted through RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> by a transmission medium other than co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. For instance, in an alternative embodiment, RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> can include microstrip signal lines with ground planes below and/or above the microstrip signal lines. Furthermore, various actuation mechanisms (electrostatic, electromagnetic, thermal, piezoelectric, etc.) can be used to switch cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the first and second states. Still further, in embodiments, RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> can accommodate more than two states. Embodiments for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> using electromagnetic actuation mechanisms and electrostatic actuation mechanisms are described in further detail in the following subsections. </paragraph>

Conductor or coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is also further described above with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> During operation, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> resides in one of two stable states. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a first stable state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> shows a second stable state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A current pulse through coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> produces a temporary magnetic field which can realign the magnetization in soft magnetic layers <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and switches cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the two stable states, as described above. After the current pulse through coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> ends, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> remains in the particular one of first and second stable states that it has moved or rotated into. Hence, the states are stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B, a</cross-reference> right end of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> is rotated downward. Hence, a torque was exerted on cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by the temporary magnetic field causing cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to rotate in this direction in an attempt to align with the temporary magnetic field, as described above.

Therefore, an RF signal cannot effectively propagate through RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Partial or total reflection of the RF signal from RF input <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is caused, and the first stable state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; state. </paragraph>

FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>G show additional steps, according to further embodiments of the present invention. The steps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>G do not necessarily have to occur in the order shown, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings herein. Other structural embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion. These steps are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Flowchart <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> begins in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> with step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, a cantilever is supported on a substrate, wherein the cantilever includes a magnetic material and a longitudinal axis. For example, the cantilever is cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown supported on substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The magnetic material can be one or both of soft magnetic layers <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, for example. The longitudinal axis is an axis of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in line with the long axis L shown for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, a first magnetic field is produced with a first permanent magnet, which thereby induces a magnetization in the magnetic material, the magnetization characterized by a magnetization vector pointing in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the cantilever, the first magnetic field being approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. For example, the first magnetic field is H<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 11B</cross-reference>. The magnetic field can be produced by bottom permanent magnet <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the magnetic field is produced by more than one permanent magnets, such as both of bottom and top permanent magnets <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>. A magnetization induced in the magnetic material can be characterized as a magnetization vector, such as magnetization vector &ldquo;m&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, first magnetic field H<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is approximately perpendicular to long axis L shown for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, a second magnetic field is produced to switch the cantilever between a first stable state and a second stable state, wherein only temporary application of the second magnetic field is required to change direction of the magnetization vector thereby causing the cantilever to switch between the first stable state and the second stable state. For example, the second magnetic field is produced by an electromagnet, such as coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. The second magnetic field switches cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between two stable states, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</cross-reference>. As described above, only a temporary application of the second magnetic field produced by coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is required to change direction of magnetization vector &ldquo;m&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Changing the direction of magnetization vector &ldquo;m&rdquo; causes cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to switch between the first stable state, an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, and the second stable state, an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, a RF transmission line is allowed to couple to a reference signal through a conducting layer of the cantilever when in the first stable state. For example, the RF transmission line is RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is allowed to couple to reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> through conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when in the first stable state. The portion of conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bottom of cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> couples reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> to RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> with an additional step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, the RF transmission line is decoupled from the reference signal when in the second stable state. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is decoupled from reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> when in the second stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> can include the step where the second magnetic field is produced with an electromagnet. For example, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C, the electromagnet can be conductor or coil <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or further type of electromagnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> can include the step where the first magnetic field is produced with the first permanent magnet and a second permanent magnet, wherein the cantilever is located between the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet. For example, the second permanent magnet is top permanent magnet <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, wherein cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is located in region <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> between them. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, a portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the RF transmission line to the reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. For example, the portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> flexes to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>, an angled portion is formed in the cantilever to enhance coupling of the RF transmission line to the reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. For example, in an alternative embodiment, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> is an angled portion of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> can be preformed at an angle to the remainder of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as the angle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. This angle of cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> allows conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, a second RF transmission line is coupled to a second reference signal with the conducting layer of the cantilever when in the second stable state. For example, RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may also provide an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition for a second RF transmission line when in the second stable state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. A second RF transmission line (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>) can be coupled to a second reference signal by conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> under left end cantilever portion <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> when in the second stable state, in a similar fashion to that shown for first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>, a first portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. For example, the first portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> flexes to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, a second portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>. For example, the portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> flexes to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple the second RF transmission line (not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C) to the second reference signal (also not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C). </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>, a first angled portion is formed in the cantilever to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. For example, in an alternative embodiment, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> is the first angled portion of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> can be pre-formed at an angle to the remainder of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as the angle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. This angle of cantilever portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> allows conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>, a second angled portion is formed in the cantilever to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>. For example, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is the second angled portion of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> can be preformed at an angle to the remainder of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C).

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can have three states. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> shows a first state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows a second state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a third state (not shown) for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is similar to the first state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. In the third state, however, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> rotates in the opposite direction. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> switches into the first state, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, by applying a voltage to first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> to induce an electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Similarly, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> switches into the third state by applying a voltage to second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to induce an electrostatic attraction between second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> switches into the second state, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, by removing from, or not applying the voltage to both of first and second gate metals <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The second state for cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is essentially a free standing state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C, a</cross-reference> right end of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> is rotated downward. Hence, a torque is exerted on cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by the electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> electrically couples (i.e., shorts) first RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and first reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an RF signal cannot effectively propagate through first RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>. Partial or total reflection of the RF signal from first RF input <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> is caused, and the first state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; state for first co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>, but is considered to be an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state for second co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> because second RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> and second reference signal <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are not coupled by conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the third state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> (not shown), a left end of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having cantilever portion <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight> is rotated downward. Hence, a torque is exerted on cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by the electrostatic attraction between second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> electrically couples (i.e., shorts) second RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> and second reference signal <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an RF signal cannot effectively propagate through second RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Partial or total reflection of the RF signal from second RF input <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is caused, and the third state for RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be an &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; state for second co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, but is considered to be an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state for first co-planar wave guide structure <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> because first RF signal transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and first reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> are not coupled by conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, neither end of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has substantially rotated toward substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not in contact with either of first and second RF signal transmission lines <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. In this state, both of first and second RF signal transmission lines <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> can transmit RF signals with minimum loss and reflection, and hence RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is considered to be in the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state for both signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Note that cantilever portions <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight> of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be angled and/or flexible.

FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>F show additional steps, according to further embodiments of the present invention. The steps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>F do not necessarily have to occur in the order shown, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings herein. Other structural embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the following discussion. These steps are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Flowchart <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> begins in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> with step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, a moveable micro-machined cantilever having a conducting layer is supported on a substrate, wherein the cantilever is switchable to a first state and to a second state. For example, the cantilever is cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of RF switch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown having conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and is supported on substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is switchable to a first state, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, and a second state, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, an electrostatic attraction is induced between a gate metal and the conducting layer to cause the cantilever to switch to the first state, wherein the conducting layer couples an RF transmission line to a reference signal when in the first state. For example, the electrostatic attraction is induced between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which causes cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to switch to the first state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. In this first state, conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> couples first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, the cantilever is allowed to switch to the second state when the cantilever is not in the first state, wherein the RF transmission line is not coupled to the reference signal in the second state. For example, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is allowed to switch to the second state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> when cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not in the first state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. In the second state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> is not coupled to first reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> includes the step where a voltage is applied to the gate metal to produce the electrostatic attraction between the gate metal and the conducting layer. For example, a voltage can be applied to first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> to produce the electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> includes the step where the voltage is removed from the gate metal to remove the electrostatic attraction between the gate metal and the conducting layer. For example, the voltage can be removed from first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> to sufficiently reduce or totally eliminate the electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> includes the step where the cantilever is allowed to position itself so that the conducting layer does not couple the RF transmission line to the reference signal. For example, because there is no electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is allowed to position itself (due to tension in torsion spring <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>, for instance) so that conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> does not couple first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> includes the step where the cantilever is supported on a torsion spring attached to the substrate, wherein the torsion spring flexes to allow the cantilever to rotate. For example, the torsion spring is torsion spring <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, which supports cantilever <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Torsion spring <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> flexes to allow cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to rotate right and left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> with an additional step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>, a portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the RF transmission line to the reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. For example, the portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> flexes to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> with an additional step <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, an angled portion is formed in the cantilever to enhance coupling of the RF transmission line to the reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. For example, in an alternative embodiment, cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> is an angled portion of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> can be pre-formed at an angle to the remainder of cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as the angle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. This angle of cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> allows conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the cantilever is switchable to a third state. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> with an additional step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>, a second electrostatic attraction is induced between a second gate metal and the conducting layer to cause the cantilever to switch to the third state, wherein the conducting layer couples a second RF transmission line to a second reference signal when in the third state. For example, a second electrostatic attraction can be induced between second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which causes cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to switch to the third state described above (not shown). In the third state, conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> couples second RF transmission line <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> to second reference signal <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> includes the step where a voltage is applied to the first gate metal to produce the first electrostatic attraction between the first gate metal and the conducting layer. For example, a voltage can be applied to first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> to produce the first electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> includes the step where a voltage is applied to the second gate metal to produce the second electrostatic attraction between the second gate metal and the conducting layer. For example, a voltage can be applied to second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to produce the second electrostatic attraction between second gate metal <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> includes the step where the cantilever is caused to rotate in a first direction to couple the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal with the conducting layer. Furthermore, in an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> includes the step where the cantilever is caused to rotate in a second direction to couple the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal with the conducting layer. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate right, or clockwise, to couple first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to first reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. Cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate left, or counterclockwise, to couple second RF transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to second reference signal <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>. Note that these directions are relative, and are merely provided for illustrative purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> includes the step where the cantilever is allowed to position itself so that the conducting layer does not couple the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal, and the conducting layer does not couple the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal. For example, in the second state, because there is no electrostatic attraction between first gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or between second gate metal <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, cantilever <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is allowed to position itself (due to tension in torsion spring <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>, for instance) so that conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> does not couple first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, and does not couple second RF transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to second reference signal <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>, a first portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. For example, the first portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> can flex to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple first RF transmission line <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> to first reference signal <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>, a second portion of the cantilever is allowed to flex to enhance coupling of the second RF transmission line to the second reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>. For example, the portion of the cantilever that is allowed to flex is cantilever portion <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>. Cantilever portion <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight> can flex (not shown) to allow conducting layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to more closely couple second RF transmission line <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to second reference signal <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight>, a first angled portion is formed in the cantilever to enhance coupling of the first RF transmission line to the first reference signal by the conducting layer in step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>.
