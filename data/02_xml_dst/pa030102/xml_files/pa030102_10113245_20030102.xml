The specific alkaline salts of omeprazole are disclosed in EP 124 495. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, i.e. effective in inhibiting gastric acid secretion, and is useful as an antiulcer agent. In a more general sense, omeprazole may be used for prevention and treatment of gastric-acid related diseases in mammals and especially in man. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Omeprazole is a sulfoxide and a chiral compound, wherein the sulfur atom being the stereogenic center. Thus, omeprazole is a racemic mixture of its two single enantiomers, the R and S-enantiomer of omeprazole, herein referred to as R-omeprazole and S-omeprazole. The absolute configurations of the enantiomers of omeprazole have been determined by an X-ray study of an N-alkylated derivative of the (&plus;)-enantiomer in non-salt form. The (&plus;)-enantiomer of the non-salt form and the (&minus;)-enantiomer of the non-salt form were found to have R and S configuration, respectively, and the (&plus;)-enantiomer of the magnesium salt and the (&minus;)-enantiomer of the magnesium salt were also found to have R and S configuration, respectively. The conditions for the optical rotation measurement for each of these enantiomers are described in WO 94/27988. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It has surprisingly been found that the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole occurs in a number of structurally different forms. It is an object of the present invention to provide a substantially pure magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate, hereinafter referred to as the compound of the invention. This trihydrate can be obtained as a well defined compound. The present invention also provides a process to obtain and a method of differentiating the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate from other forms of magnesium salts of S-omeprazole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention is advantageous because it is more stable than the corresponding magnesium salt compounds in prior art and is therefore easier to handle and is store. The compound of the invention is also easier to characterize because it exists in a well-defined state. Additionally, the compound of the invention is easier to synthesize in a reproducible manner and thereby easier to handle in a full scale production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate obtained according to the present invention is substantially free from magnesium salts of R-omeprazole. The magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate obtained according to the present invention is also substantially free from other forms of magnesium salts of S-omeprazole, such as the corresponding magnesium salt compounds described in prior art, and dihydrates used in the preparation of the trihydrate compound according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention is characterized by the positions and intensities of the major peaks in the X-ray powder diffractogram, but may also be characterized by conventional FT-IR spectroscopy. These characteristics are not exhibited by any other form of magnesium salt of S-omeprazole and accordingly, the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate is easily distinguishable from any other crystal form of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole disclosed in prior art. The compound of the invention is characterized by being highly crystalline, i.e. having a higher crystallinity than any other form of magnesium salt of S-omeprazole disclosed in the prior art. With the expression &ldquo;any other form&rdquo; is meant anhydrates, hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs or amorphous forms thereof disclosed in the prior art. Examples of any other forms of magnesium salt of S-omeprazole includes, but are not limited to, anhydrates, monohydrates, dihydrates, sesquihydrates, trihydrates, alcoholates, such as methanolates and ethanolates, and polymorphs or amorphous forms thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention may also be characterized by its unit cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate which comprises; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a) treating a magnesium salt of S-omeprazole of any form, for example prepared according to procedures known in the art such as Example A in WO 96/01623 which is incorporated herein by reference, with water at a suitable temperature for a suitable time. By a suitable temperature is meant a temperature, which induces the transformation of starting material to product without decomposing any of these compounds. Examples of such suitable temperatures include, but are not limited to, room temperature and above. By a suitable time is meant a time that results in high conversion of the starting material into product without causing any decomposition of either compounds, i.e. results in a good yield. This suitable time will vary depending on the temperature used in a way well known to people in the art. The higher the temperature, the shorter time is needed to give the desired conversion. The amount of water is not crucial and will depend on the process conditions used. The magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate is thereafter separated from the aqueous slurry, for example by filtration or centrifugation and thereafter dried to constant weight; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> b) oxidizing 5-methoxy-2-&lsqb;&lsqb;(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl&rsqb;thio&rsqb;-1H-benzimidazole, with an oxidizing agent and a chiral titanium complex, optionally in the presence of a base. The oxidation is carried out in an organic solvent, for example toluene or dichloromethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The crude product is converted to the corresponding potassium salt by treatment with a potassium source, such as methanolic potassium hydroxide or methanolic potassium methylate, followed by isolation of the formed salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The resulting potassium salt of S-omeprazole is thereafter converted to the corresponding magnesium salt by treatment with a magnesium source, such as magnesium sulfate in a lower alcohol, such as methanol. The solution is optionally filtered and the precipitation is initialized by addition of a non-solvent such as acetone. The product is filtered off and optionally washed with water and further processed as is described in a) above. Alternatively, the potassium salt may be treated with a magnesium source, such as magnesium sulfate in water, and isolation of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate, or any other conventional technique for transforming a potassium salt to the corresponding magnesium salt can be used and is within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> One process for obtaining esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate is described in Example 7. In this example, the aqueous solution of magnesium sulfate is added to an aqueous solution of esomeprazole potassium. However, the resulting solution is a foamy mixture. This foaming tendency of the mixture makes the process exceptionally difficult to scale up. Surprisingly, it has now have found that a reversed order of addition, i.e., adding an aqueous solution of esomeprazole potassium to an aqueous solution of magnesium sulfate, provides a method where the foaming is advantageously and substantially reduced to minor proportions. Thus, by this reversed order of addition as exemplified by Example 8, it is possible to effortlessly scale up the process for large production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Yet a further aspect of the present invention is to provide a suitable intermediate used in the preparation of the compound of the invention, as well as a process for its preparation. The potassium salt of S-omeprazole is found to be such a suitable intermediate. The potassium salt of S-omeprazole may also be used as an active component of a pharmaceutical formulation to be used in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention, i.e. the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate, prepared according to the present invention may be analyzed by XRPD, a technique which is known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The amount of water in the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate is determined by thermogravimetric analysis, a technique which is known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention is effective as a gastric acid secretion inhibitor, and is useful as an antiulcer agent. In a more general sense, it can be used for prevention and treatment of gastric-acid related conditions in mammals and especially in man, including e.g. reflux esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer. Furthermore, it may be used for treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders where gastric acid inhibitory effect is desirable e.g. in patients on NSAID therapy, in patients with Non Ulcer Dyspepsia, in patients with symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and in patients with gastrinomas. The compound of the invention may also be used in patients in intensive care situations, in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pre- and postoperatively to prevent aspiration of gastric acid and to prevent and treat stress ulceration. Further, the compound of the invention may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis as well as in the treatment of Helicobacter infections and diseases related to these. The compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of inflammatory conditions in mammals, including man. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing the patient with an effective dosage of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate, according to the invention. For example, peroral or parental formulations and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include capsules, tablets, dispersions, suspensions and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is further provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate according to the invention, as active ingredient, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. Compositions comprising other therapeutic ingredients are especially of interest in the treatment of Helicobacter infections. The invention also provides the use of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a gastric-acid related condition and a method of treating a gastric-acid related condition which method comprises administering to a subject suffering from said condition a therapeutically effective amount of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the invention include compositions suitable for peroral or parental administration. The most preferred route is the oral route. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage forms, and prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the practice of the invention, the most suitable route of administration as well as the magnitude of a therapeutic dose of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate according to the invention in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated. The dose, and dose frequency, may also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. Special requirements may be needed for patients having Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, such as a need for higher doses than the average patient. Children and patients with liver diseases generally will benefit from doses that are somewhat lower than the average. Thus, in some conditions it may be necessary to use doses outside the ranges stated below, for example long term treatments may request lower dosage. Such higher and lower doses are within the scope of the present invention. Such daily doses may vary between 5 mg to 300 mg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In general, a suitable oral dosage form of the compound of the invention may cover a dose range from 5 mg to 300 mg total daily dose, administered in one single dose or equally divided doses. A preferred dosage range is from 10 mg to 80 mg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The compound of the invention may be combined as the active component in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional techniques, such as the oral formulations described in WO 96/01623 and EP 247 983, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated as a whole by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Combination preparations comprising the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole trihydrate and other active ingredients may also be used. Examples of such active ingredients include, but are not limited to anti-bacterial compounds, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antacid agents, alginates and prokinetic agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The examples which follow will further illustrate the preparation of the compound of the invention, according to different process routes and including new intermediates. These examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined hereinabove or as claimed below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Magnesium (0.1 &mgr;g, 4.5 mmol) was dissolved and reacted with methanol (50 ml) at 40&deg; C. with a catalytic amount of methylene chloride. The reaction was run under nitrogen and was finished after five hours. At room temperature a mixture of the two enantiomers &lsqb;90% (&minus;)-isomer and 10% (&plus;)-isomer&rsqb; of 5-methoxy-2-&lsqb;&lsqb;(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl&rsqb;sulfinyl&rsqb;-1H-benzimidazole (2.84 g, 8.2 mmol) was added to the magnesium methoxide solution. The mixture was stirred for 12 hours whereupon a small amount of water (0.1 ml) was added in order to precipitate inorganic magnesium salts. After 30 minutes stirring, these inorganic salts were filtered off and the solution was concentrated on a rotavapor. The residue was now a concentrated methanolic solution of the enantiomeric mixture (i.e. the title compound contaminated with the (&plus;)-isomer), with an optical purity (enantiomeric excess, e.e.) of 80%. This mixture was diluted with acetone (100 ml) and after stirring at room temperature for 15 minutes, a white precipitate was obtained. Additional stirring for 15 minutes and thereafter filtration afforded 1.3 g (50%) of the title compound as white crystals. Chiral analyses of the crystals and mother liquor were performed by chromatography on an analytical chiral column. The optical purity of the crystals and mother liquor was found to be 98.4 e.e. and 64.4% e.e., respectively. Thus, the optical purity (e.e.) has been enhanced from 80% to 98.4% simply by crystallizing the Mg-salt from a mixture of acetone and methanol. The product was crystalline as shown by powder X-ray diffraction and the magnesium content was 3.44% as shown by atomic absorption spectroscopy. </paragraph>
