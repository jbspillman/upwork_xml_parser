<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of stabilizing metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves during storage and handling, to stabilized metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves and metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve containing catalysts and to their use in adsorption and conversion processes, especially the conversion of oxygenates to olefins. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Olefins are traditionally produced from petroleum feedstock by catalytic or steam cracking processes. These cracking processes, especially steam cracking, produce light olefin(s) such as ethylene and/or propylene from a variety of hydrocarbon feedstock. It has been known for some time that oxygenates, especially alcohols, are convertible into light olefin(s). Methanol, the preferred alcohol for light olefin production, is typically synthesized from the catalytic reaction of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide in a methanol reactor in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst. The preferred methanol conversion process is generally referred to as a methanol-to-olefin(s) process, where methanol is converted to primarily ethylene and/or propylene in the presence of a molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One of the most useful molecular sieves for converting methanol to olefin(s) are the metalloaluminophosphates such as the silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO&apos;s) and the aluminophosphates (ALPO&apos;s). SAPO synthesis is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,871, which is herein fully incorporated by reference. SAPO is generally synthesized by the hydrothermal crystallization of a reaction mixture of silicon-, aluminum- and phosphorus-sources and at least one templating agent. Synthesis of a SAPO molecular sieve, its formulation into a SAPO catalyst, and its use in converting a hydrocarbon feedstock into olefin(s), particularly where the feedstock is methanol, is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,499,327, 4,677,242, 4,677,243, 4,873,390, 5,095,163, 5,714,662 and 6,166,282, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered that metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves, especially silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieves, and aluminophosphate (ALPO) molecular sieves are relatively unstable to moisture containing atmospheres such as ambient air when in the calcined or partially calcined state; this state is sometimes referred to as the activated state. It has also been observed that the relative stability is in part related to the nature of the organic templating agent used in the manufacture of the SAPO molecular sieve. Briend et al., J.Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 8270-8276, teaches that SAPO-34 loses its crystallinity when the template has been removed from the sieve and the detemplated, activated sieve has been exposed to air. Data is presented, however, which suggest that over at least the short term, crystallinity loss is reversible. Even over a period of a couple years, the data suggest that crystallinity loss is reversible when certain templates are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,681,864 to Edwards et al. discusses the use of SAPO-37 molecular sieve as a commercial cracking catalyst. It is disclosed that activated SAPO-37 molecular sieve has poor stability. However, stability can be improved by using a particular activation process. According to the process, retained organic template present from the synthesis of the SAPO-37 is removed from the core structure of the sieve just prior to contacting with feed to be cracked. The process calls for subjecting the sieve to a temperature of 400-800&deg; C. within the catalytic cracking unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,310 to Degnan et al. discloses another method of activating silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve compositions. The method calls for contacting a crystalline silicoaluminophosphate with gel alumina and water, and thereafter heating the mixture to at least 425&deg; C. The heating process is first carried out in the presence of an oxygen-depleted gas, and then in the presence of an oxidizing gas. The objective of the heating process is to enhance the acid activity of the catalyst. The acid activity is enhanced as a result of the intimate contact between the alumina and the molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,746 to Sun et.al. discloses a process for the conversion of oxygenated organic materials to olefins using a modified small pore molecular sieve catalyst. The molecular sieve catalyst is modified with polynuclear aromatic heterocyclic compounds in which at least three interconnected ring structures are present having at least one nitrogen atom as a ring substituent, and with each ring having at least five ring members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> European Published Application EP-A2-0,203,005 discusses the use of SAPO-37 molecular sieve in a zeolite catalyst composite as a commercial cracking catalyst. According to the document, if organic template is retained in the SAPO-37 molecular sieve until a catalyst composite containing zeolite and the SAPO-37 molecular sieve is activated during use, and if thereafter the catalyst is maintained under conditions wherein exposure to moisture is minimized, the crystalline structure of the SAPO-37 zeolite composite remains stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> PCT Publication No. WO 00/74848 to Janssen et.al. discloses a method of protecting the catalytic activity of silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves by covering the catalytic sites with a shield prior to contacting with an oxygenate feedstock. The shielding may be achieved by retaining template within the pores of the molecular sieve, by using carbonaceous materials, or by using an anhydrous gas or liquid environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> PCT Publication No. WO 00/75072 to Fung et.al. discloses a method for addressing the problems relating to protecting molecular sieves from damage due to contact with moisture and damage due to physical contact. The method requires the heat treatment of a molecular sieve containing a template under conditions effective to remove a portion of the template from the microporous structure and cooling the heated molecular sieve to leave an amount of template or degradation product thereof effective to cover catalytic sites within the microporous structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> PCT Publication No. WO 00/74846 to Janssen et.al. discloses a method for preserving the catalytic activity of silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves which comprises the heating of template-containing silicoaluminophosphate in an oxygen depleted environment under conditions effective to provide an integrated catalyst life which is greater than that obtained using a non-oxygen depleted environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,745 to Wu et.al. is concerned with overcoming the problem of the excessive production of coke, which occurs when some silicoaluminophosphates are used as catalysts in the conversion of oxygenated hydrocarbons to olefins. The solution proposed is the use of nitrided silicoaluminophosphates. Nitridation is achieved by the reaction of the silicoaluminophosphate with ammonia at elevated temperatures, typically in excess of 700&deg; C. The nitridation reaction is essentially irreversible and destroys irreversibly the acidic sites of the molecular sieve, as the acidic OH groups are converted to NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups during the nitridation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,938 to Lewis et.al describes a process for converting feedstocks. Matrix material used in the manufacture of the catalyst for the process may be conditioned prior to catalyst manufacture by exposure to ammonia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,647 to Barger describes a process for the hydrothermal treatment of silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves. The process requires the treatment to be undertaken at temperatures in excess of 700&deg; C. to destroy a large proportion of the acid sites whilst at the same time retaining a significant proportion of the original crystallinity. Also disclosed in this document is a test method for determining the molecular sieve acidity. This test method requires the adsorption of ammonia onto the molecular sieve, followed by desorption within the temperature range of 300 to 600&deg; C. and titration of the desorbed ammonia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As seen from the disclosures described herein, many metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves will exhibit a shortened catalytic life when exposed to a moisture-containing environment. This loss of catalytic life is, in some instances, irreversible, and can occur over a very short period of time. In essence, this loss of catalytic life is due to a loss in the number of acid catalytic sites. In addition there may be irreversible loss of molecular sieve crystallinity and porosity on ageing during storage and handling after manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is desirable therefore to develop methods for the treatment of metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves and catalysts containing these molecular sieves, which ensure that the catalytic properties and physical properties of these materials, such as porosity and crystallinity, are retained after storage and handling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for the preparation of stabilized metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves and metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve containing catalysts, and to their use in conversion processes. The resultant stabilized molecular sieve retains its catalytic activity and its physical properties even after extensive periods of aging in the presence of moisture. It has been found that if metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves are treated after activation with specific types of compounds then the molecular sieve is stabilized against hydrolytic attack during storage. Importantly the treatment is reversible so that after periods of storage the compounds may be easily removed to re-generate the activated molecular sieve. The process of the present invention utilizes specific nitrogen containing compounds, which may be chemisorbed and/or physisorbed onto the activated molecular sieve. Importantly the nitrogen containing compounds are not irreversibly chemically reacted with the activated molecular sieves so that they may be easily removed. Without being bound by any theory it is believed that the compounds as used in the present invention are chemisorbed and/or physisorbed onto acid sites on the activated molecular sieves. An important sub-class of nitrogen-containing compounds, which may be used and are preferably used in the present invention, are those that have a kinetic diameter greater than the pore size of the activated molecular sieve. Such molecules are unable to enter the pores of the molecular sieve and therefore are excluded from the internal cage of the molecular sieve structure. It has surprisingly been found that although these nitrogen-containing materials are excluded from the cage of the molecular sieves the internal Broensted acid sites of the activated metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves are protected during storage from hydrolytic attack. In the context of the present invention reference will be made throughout this specification to metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves; this term as used in this specification encompasses aluminophosphate (ALPO) and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieves and derivatives of these molecular sieves as hereinbefore and hereinafter described. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Introduction </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The invention is primarily directed toward a method of stabilizing metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves and catalyst compositions containing metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves. It has been found that the treatment of metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves with one or more nitrogen containing compounds as herein defined so that the nitrogen containing compound is chemisorbed and/or physisorbed with the molecular sieve results in stabilized metalloaluminophosphates which are resistant to degradation during exposure to moisture. Through this method treated metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve materials and catalyst compositions are provided which retain most if not all of their original adsorption, catalytic and/or physical properties on storage even after extensive periods of exposure to ambient atmosphere or steam. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that when the nitrogen containing compound has a kinetic diameter which allows the compound to enter the cage of the molecular sieve, then the compound is able to react in a reversible way with the Broensted acid sites within the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve and also any surface acid sites outside of the cage, and in doing so protects them from attack by moisture during storage and handling. When the nitrogen-containing compound has a kinetic diameter that is greater than that of the pore diameters of the molecular sieve it is believed that the nitrogen-containing compound is chemisorbed and /or physisorbed only with those acid sites, which are on the surface i.e. outside of the molecular sieve cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The Chemisorbed and/or Physisorbed Nitrogen Containing Compounds </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A key aspect of the present invention is the chemisorption and/or physisorption of nitrogen containing compounds with active sites especially acid catalytic sites of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. The process of chemisorption according to the present invention is a chemical adsorption process in which a weak chemical bond is formed between molecules in the gaseous or liquid state and a solid surface. Due to this weak bonding the process is reversible upon the application of heat. In the context of the present invention nitrogen containing compounds are the molecules, which may be in the gaseous or liquid state, and the solid surface is the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. In the case of physisorption the nitrogen containing compounds may be adsorbed onto the surface of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve by relatively weak forces such as van der Waals forces. In both chemisorption and physisorption the nitrogen-containing compound may be recovered intact from the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve if the appropriate desorption conditions are utilized. However, it is also possible to desorb the nitrogen containing compounds using conditions which result in the total or partial destruction of the nitrogen containing compound e.g. under high temperature oxidation conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Suitable nitrogen-containing compounds for use in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of amines, monocyclic heterocyclic compounds, organonitrile compounds and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the nitrogen containing compounds have a kinetic diameter, which is less than the diameter of the pores of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. In a further embodiment the nitrogen containing compounds have a kinetic diameter, which is larger than the pores of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. It is preferred that the nitrogen-containing compound has a kinetic diameter, which is greater than the pore diameter of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. The nitrogen containing organic compounds may be amines, mono-cyclic heterocyclic compounds, and organonitrile compounds which contain atoms other than C, N, and H such as for example O; they may therefore contain functional groups such as alcohol, acid, ester, ether or aldehyde groups. In addition the compounds may be used as salts with counter-ions such as for example fluoride, bromide and chloride being present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The amines may be aliphatic amines, cycloaliphatic amines, aralkyl amines and alkylaryl amines. These may be primary, secondary and tertiary amines. They may also be quaternary ammonium salts with a counter ion. It is preferred that the nitrogen-containing compound is a primary, secondary or tertiary amine, preferably an aliphatic amine. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen-containing compound may be one or more compounds used as templating agents during synthesis of the molecular sieve. In such case it must have a kinetic diameter which is greater than the pore mouth diameter of the molecular sieve and therefore will be chemisorbed and/or physisorbed outside of the molecular sieve cage during the stabilization process. Such chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen-containing compounds may be removed substantially intact from the treated molecular sieve. This is in contrast to the template-containing molecular sieves in which the nitrogen-containing compound is effectively trapped within the cage of the molecular sieve and may only be removed from the cage through destruction of the nitrogen-containing compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Chemisorption/Physisorption Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Preferably prior to chemisorption and/or physisorption of the nitrogen-containing compound the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve or catalyst comprising the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve is activated. The primary function of the activation process is to remove volatile compounds and template utilized in the synthesis of the molecular sieve that may still be present in or on the molecular sieve. Activation also removes carbonaceous deposits (coke) that form when the molecular sieve or catalyst composition comprising the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve is used in a catalytic conversion process. It is envisaged that in the process of the present invention the molecular sieve may be partially activated. By partially activated is meant that a proportion of the template or byproducts of the template is not removed prior to chemisorption. Such template materials will remain within the cage of the molecular sieve and are not regarded as chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds as used in the present invention. It is preferred that substantially the entire template is removed on activation. Activation is achieved using conventional calcination techniques and conditions as discussed below. Typical calcination temperatures are in the range from about 400&deg; C. to about 1,000&deg; C., preferably from about 500&deg; C. to about 800&deg; C., and most preferably from about 550&deg; C. to about 700&deg; C., preferably in a calcination environment such as air, nitrogen, helium, flue gas (combustion product lean in oxygen), or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The activated molecular sieve or catalyst composition comprising a metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve may be chemisorbed and/or physisorbed with nitrogen containing compounds under a variety of conditions. The nitrogen containing compounds may be chemisorbed and/or physisorbed in the liquid or gaseous state. Preferably it is chemisorbed and/or physisorbed in the liquid state. In one embodiment the activated molecular sieve is introduced into a treatment vessel, which enables the molecular sieve to be degassed. This is typically achieved by utilizing a vacuum, preferably with the application of heat. Typically the molecular sieve may be degassed under vacuum at a temperature within the range of 10 to 600&deg; C., and preferably 20 to 300&deg; C. In an alternative embodiment the molecular sieve is treated as activated without degassing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen containing compounds may be introduced to the treatment vessel containing the degassed molecular sieve or the as activated molecular sieve. The nitrogen containing compounds may be introduced with or without the use of an inert carrier gas such as dry nitrogen or similar gas or with or without a suitable liquid solvent. Ideally the molecular sieve is treated with an amount of nitrogen containing compound, which is sufficient to chemisorb, and/or physisorb with the accessible acid sites of the molecular sieve. The acid sites may be determined by ammonia TPD. When the nitrogen containing compound has a kinetic diameter which is less than the molecular sieve pore diameter the Broensted acid sites within the cage may be chemisorbed with the amine as well as acid sites outside of the cage. Thus the determination of total acidity will provide a guide as to the amount of nitrogen containing compound required. When the kinetic diameter is larger than the molecular sieve pore size then the nitrogen containing compounds will be chemisorbed and/or physisorbed with acid sites including Broensted acid sites located outside of the cage and the internal cage sites will not be affected. In this instance the amount of nitrogen containing compound used in the treatment may be less than the equivalent required to chemisorb and/or physisorb with all the acid sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen containing compounds may be introduced at ambient temperatures or at elevated temperatures. It is important that the temperature is selected so that the nitrogen containing compounds do not react with the molecular sieve under nitridation conditions. It is possible to determine suitable temperatures for any given molecular sieve by observing the chemisorption and desorption of nitrogen containing compounds using analytical techniques such as the Infrared techniques described herein. If a temperature is used which results in an irreversible reaction with the nitrogen containing compounds as may be determined by these techniques, then a lower reaction temperature should be selected. The nitrogen containing compounds may be reacted with the molecular sieve at a temperature of less than 200&deg; C., ideally less than 180&deg; C., preferably less than 160&deg; C.; ideally within the temperature range of 0 to 200&deg; C. or 10 to 180&deg; C., preferably 20 to 160&deg; C., or 20 to 140&deg; C., and most preferably 0 to 100&deg; C. The nitrogen containing compounds may initially be introduced at a low temperature and the temperature may then be raised above this temperature during the reaction. The exact time required to complete the chemisorption and/or physisorption process is dependent on the amount of acidity present in the molecular sieve. The time for chemisorption/physisorption and/or the amount of nitrogen containing compounds used and/or the temperature of chemisorption/physisorption may be used to ensure that sufficient nitrogen containing compounds is chemisorbed and/or physisorbed. It is also possible to determine the optimum conditions for any given molecular sieve by undertaking a series of adsorption and desorption experiments to determine under what conditions complete chemisorption/physisorption is achieved. Once determined these conditions may be used in the chemisorption process. Typically, the chemisorption process is complete after 30 minutes exposure to the nitrogen containing compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is envisaged that the chemisorption process with nitrogen containing compounds may be undertaken on a composition comprising metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve and in particular a catalyst composition. In this embodiment the composition comprising metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve and other materials e.g. catalyst components, is exposed to nitrogen containing compounds under conditions that result in the chemisorption of nitrogen containing compounds with the molecular sieve. This exposure to nitrogen containing compounds may be achieved by introducing the nitrogen containing compounds into the end zone of the calcination unit used in the manufacture of a catalyst composition. This zone is typically at temperatures below the calcination temperature as the catalyst is being cooled before being introduced into storage drums. In this and other embodiments the nitrogen containing compounds may be introduced in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The molecular sieve or molecular sieve-containing catalyst composition comprising chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds is stable when stored under ambient conditions. By stable is meant that there is less reduction in the catalytic activity of the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed molecular sieve compared to the non-chemisorbed and/or physisorbed molecular sieve when stored under the same conditions. The molecular sieve comprising chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds may be maintained in the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed state for an extended period of time, which is typically at least 24 hours and which may be for any period of storage or handling greater than 24 hours. In one embodiment the molecular sieve is maintained in the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed state for at least 36 hours, preferably at least 48 hours and most preferably at least 72 hours. Ideally it is held in this state as long as possible before use. In one embodiment the molecular sieve is held in the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed state until it is utilized in the manufacture of a catalyst composition. In a further embodiment it is held in the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed state prior to introduction as the catalyst or part of a catalyst composition into a catalyzed reaction. In this embodiment the preferred catalyzed reaction is a methanol-to-olefins process. It is also envisaged within the scope of the present invention that the chemisorption process may be undertaken on used metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve or used catalyst compositions comprising metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. During conversion processes, such as methanol-to-olefin processes, it may be necessary to shut the reactor down in either an emergency or in a planned shutdown and maintenance cycle. When this occurs it is often necessary to remove the used catalyst from the reactor and to place it into temporary storage, which is usually under an inert atmosphere. Sometimes removal is not necessary or desirable and the catalyst is maintained within the plant itself. In both situations the catalyst is under risk of losing its catalytic activity and/or other properties due to aging effects. In addition during shut down and start-up the reactor may be under conditions which generate significant quantities of steam at high temperature i.e. superheated steam. Such conditions are particularly harmful to metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve containing catalysts. The nitrogen containing compounds chemisorption method of the present invention has been found to be particularly effective in protecting metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve materials against the effects of steam as would be present in the methanol-to-olefins process. In this embodiment the used catalyst may be treated to chemisorb and/or physisorb with nitrogen containing compounds as it is removed from the methanol-to-olefins plant; the nitrogen containing compounds can then be desorbed when the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed catalyst is reintroduced to the plant. In an alternative embodiment the used catalyst is treated within the plant during or after shutdown. In a particularly preferred embodiment the used catalyst is exposed to nitrogen containing compounds within the plant at temperatures above those at which steam significantly degrades the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Desorption Conditions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The catalytic activity of the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve in the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed state may be restored by desorption of the nitrogen containing compounds. This may be achieved by heating the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve at temperatures in excess of 200&deg; C., and preferably in excess of 400&deg; C., and most preferably in excess of 600&deg; C. This desorption may be achieved using a muffle furnace or similar furnace. It may also be achieved by using the same equipment used for calcination during manufacture of the molecular sieve or catalyst compositions contacting the molecular sieve. In one embodiment the nitrogen containing compounds may be removed during the manufacture of a formulated catalyst under spray drying conditions. In a further embodiment the nitrogen containing compounds may be removed in situ on introduction of the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve to a catalytic conversion process such as a methanol-to-olefins process. This may be achieved by introduction of chemisorbed and/or physisorbed metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve to the regeneration unit of the plant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the context of the present invention an aged metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve is a metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve as synthesized or formulated as a catalyst, which has been stored for an extended period of time after synthesis, or it is a metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve material, which has been used in a catalytic process and has been removed from that process or temporarily retained under non-optimum process conditions such as in a shutdown phase. Similarly, in the context of the invention, an aged catalyst composition is a catalyst composition as formed, which has been stored for an extended period of time after synthesis, or it is a catalyst composition, which has been used in a catalytic process and has been removed from that process or temporarily retained under non-optimum process conditions such as in a shutdown phase. By extended periods of time is meant a period of greater than 24 hours, preferably greater than 36 hours, more preferably greater than 48 hours, and most preferably greater than 72 hours. The period of ageing may be under ambient conditions or elevated temperature, it may be undertaken under an inert atmosphere or a vacuum, for example in a sealed container such as storage drum or metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve holding facility after manufacture of the sieve or a catalyst composition containing the metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve. In the context of the present invention aged metalloaluminophosphates are typically present in large amounts i.e. the bulk state. By bulk state is meant in the form of a large batch of material or catalyst comprising the metalloaluminophosphate. Typically a bulk sample has a batch size of greater than 1 kilogram, preferably greater than 10 kilogram and most preferably greater than 50 kilogram. The ageing may be undertaken in the presence of an inert gas in addition to the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds. In the present invention it is possible to utilize grades of inert gases which were hitherto unacceptable for metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve storage due to inter alia their moisture content. Such gases may be of lower purity and quality e.g. they may contain higher than normal levels of impurities such as oxygen and/or moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Metalloaluminophosphate Acidity and Infrared </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve materials such as silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves comprise a three-dimensional microporous crystal framework structure and exhibit a particularly desirable Broensted acid OH group spectrum in the Infrared, when the template material has been properly removed. Broensted acid OH groups can be conveniently characterized by Diffused Reflectance Infrared (DRIFTS) spectroscopy. The groups can be found throughout a range of 4000 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 3400 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>of the IR spectrum. However, silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves which exhibit desirable catalytic activity upon appropriate template removal have Broensted acid OH groups having one or more bands in the IR with wave numbers ranging from about 3630 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to about 3580 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, with non-Broensted OH groups like Al&mdash;OH, P&mdash;OH and/or Si&mdash;OH being largely located in the range of about 4000 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to about 3630 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The non-Broensted OH groups are also typically located on the external surface of the molecular sieve or at regions within the sieve that exhibit internal defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In order to preserve catalytic activity, i.e., maintain acid catalyst sites, this invention provides a method, which comprises chemisorbing and/or physisorbing nitrogen containing compounds with the acid sites of the molecular sieve. The chemisorption may be observed and monitored through the use of DRIFTS. When the nitrogen containing compounds is chemisorbed the infrared adsorption bands relating to the Broensted acid sites decrease in intensity and are replaced by a new series of a infrared absorption bands at lower wave numbers between 2300 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and 3500 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, when the nitrogen containing compound is fully chemisorbed. When the chemisorbed nitrogen containing compounds is subsequently removed through desorption these characteristic infrared absorptions decrease in intensity and eventually disappear whilst the original Broensted acid absorption bands re-appear at higher wave numbers. The intensity of the restored Broensted acidity infrared bands is comparable to the bands observed prior to chemisorption. This infrared behavior is typical with the process of the present invention and is a good method for determining that the acid sites and especially the Broensted acid sites of the molecular sieve have been protected through chemisorption of the nitrogen containing compounds and restored through desorption of the nitrogen containing compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Extended exposure of metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves to ambient atmosphere results in a loss of catalytic activity. One suitable method for determining this activity and its loss is to determine the methanol adsorption capacity (MAC) of the molecular sieve after synthesis and activation and to monitor this capacity with time after a period of storage. Ideally the MAC should remain as high as possible up to the point at which the molecular sieve is used in a conversion process such as a methanol-to-olefins process. For molecular sieve catalysts, which are activated in situ, i.e. the template is removed on introduction of the molecular sieve to the conversion process, the time between activation and actual contact with feed is short enough such that the initial methanol adsorption capacity is essentially equivalent to the methanol adsorption capacity at feed contact. During conventional storage conditions e.g. under an inert atmosphere, this is not normally achieved as the catalyst is progressively degraded by attack from moisture. In the present invention the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds are effective in retaining the methanol uptake properties of the molecular sieve, which are higher than those achieved without chemisorption and/or physisorption with the nitrogen containing compounds. It is particularly surprising that the chemisorption and/or physisorption using nitrogen containing compounds with kinetic diameters larger than the molecular sieve pores protects the internal Broensted acid sites which remain exposed after treatment. The measurement of MAC may be used in the context of the present invention to demonstrate the effective stabilization due to the chemisorption and/or physisorption of nitrogen containing compounds. The use of chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds results in improved MAC values after storage. According to this invention, it is preferred that the MAC after nitrogen containing compounds desorption is at least 15% of the original MAC prior to chemisorption of nitrogen containing compounds, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 60%, and most preferably at least 80%. Techniques for measuring methanol adsorption capacity are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>

Typically, a combination of sources of silicon, aluminum and phosphorous, optionally with one or more templating agents and/or one or more metal containing compounds are placed in a sealed pressure vessel, optionally lined with an inert plastic such as polytetrafluoroethylene, and heated, under a crystallization pressure and temperature, until a crystalline material is formed, and then recovered by filtration, centrifugation and/or decanting. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the weight ratio of the binder to the matrix material used in the formation of the molecular sieve catalyst composition is from 0:1 to 1:15, preferably 1:15 to 1:5, more preferably 1:10 to 1:4, and most preferably 1:6 to 1:5. It has been found that a higher sieve content, lower matrix content, increases the molecular sieve catalyst composition performance, however, lower sieve content, higher matrix material, improves the attrition resistance of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Upon combining the molecular sieve with or without chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds, and the matrix material, optionally with a binder, in a liquid to form a slurry, mixing, preferably rigorous mixing is needed to produce a substantially homogeneous mixture containing the molecular sieve. Non-limiting examples of suitable liquids include one or a combination of water, alcohol, ketones, aldehydes, and/or esters. The most preferred liquid is water. In one embodiment, the slurry is colloid-milled for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired slurry texture, sub-particle size, and/or sub-particle size distribution. In the present invention the use of a metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve, which comprises chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds, is beneficial in the catalyst formulation process as the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds protects the molecular sieve from the detrimental effects of the water utilized in the formulation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The molecular sieve with and without chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds and matrix material, and the optional binder, may be in the same or different liquid, and may be combined in any order, together, simultaneously, sequentially, or a combination thereof. In the preferred embodiment, the same liquid, preferably water is used. The molecular sieve, matrix material, and optional binder, are combined in a liquid as solids, substantially dry or in a dried form, or as slurries, together or separately. If solids are added together as dry or substantially dried solids, it is preferable to add a limited and/or controlled amount of liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the slurry of the molecular sieve with or without chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds, binder and matrix materials is mixed or milled to achieve a sufficiently uniform slurry of sub-particles of the molecular sieve catalyst composition that is then fed to a forming unit that produces the molecular sieve catalyst composition. In a preferred embodiment, the forming unit is spray dryer. Typically, the forming unit is maintained at a temperature sufficient to remove most of the liquid from the slurry, and from the resulting molecular sieve catalyst composition. The resulting catalyst composition when formed in this way takes the form of microspheres. If chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds are present prior to spray drying it may if desired be removed during the spray drying process by selecting appropriate temperatures to ensure that the nitrogen containing compounds are desorbed. Alternatively the spray drying conditions may be selected to ensure that the chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds are substantially retained within the spray-dried material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When a spray drier is used as the forming unit, typically, the slurry of the molecular sieve and matrix material, and optionally a binder, is co-fed to the spray drying volume with a drying gas with an average inlet temperature ranging from 200 C to 550 C, and a combined outlet temperature ranging from 100 C to about 225 C. In an embodiment, the average diameter of the spray dried formed catalyst composition is from about 40 &mgr;m to about 300 &mgr;m, preferably from about 50 &mgr;m to about 250 &mgr;m, more preferably from about 50 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m, and most preferably from about 65 &mgr;m to about 90 &mgr;m. If desired the average inlet and/or outlet temperature of the spray drier may be selected to enable the desorption of chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds to occur during the spray drying process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> During spray drying, the slurry is passed through a nozzle distributing the slurry into small droplets, resembling an aerosol spray into a drying chamber. Atomization is achieved by forcing the slurry through a single nozzle or multiple nozzles with a pressure drop in the range of from 100 psia to 1000 psia (690 kPaa to 6895 kPaa). In another embodiment, the slurry is co-fed through a single nozzle or multiple nozzles along with an atomization fluid such as air, steam, flue gas, or any other suitable gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the slurry described above is directed to the perimeter of a spinning wheel that distributes the slurry into small droplets, the size of which is controlled by many factors including slurry viscosity, surface tension, flow rate, pressure, and temperature of the slurry, the shape and dimension of the nozzle(s), or the spinning rate of the wheel. These droplets are then dried in a co-current or counter-current flow of air passing through a spray drier to form a substantially dried or dried molecular sieve catalyst composition, more specifically a molecular sieve in powder form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Generally, the size of the powder is controlled to some extent by the solids content of the slurry. However, control of the size of the catalyst composition and its spherical characteristics are controllable by varying the slurry feed properties and conditions of atomization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Other methods for forming a molecular sieve catalyst composition is described in U.S. patent application Ser.

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the formulated molecular sieve catalyst composition contains from about 1% to about 99%, more preferably from about 5% to about 90%, and most preferably from about 10% to about 80%, by weight of the molecular sieve based on the total weight of the molecular sieve catalyst composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the weight percent of binder in or on the spray dried molecular sieve catalyst composition based on the total weight of the binder, molecular sieve, and matrix material is from about 2% by weight to about 30% by weight, preferably from about 5% by weight to about 20% by weight, and more preferably from about 7% by weight to about 15% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Once the molecular sieve catalyst composition is formed in a substantially dry or dried state, to further harden and/or activate the formed catalyst composition, a heat treatment such as calcination, at an elevated temperature is usually performed. A conventional calcination environment is air that typically includes a small amount of water vapor. Typical calcination temperatures are in the range from about 400&deg; C. to about 1,000&deg; C., preferably from about 500&deg; C. to about 800&deg; C., and most preferably from about 550&deg; C. to about 700&deg; C., preferably in a calcination environment such as air, nitrogen, helium, flue gas (combustion product lean in oxygen), or any combination thereof. During this calcination process chemisorbed and/or physisorbed nitrogen containing compounds if present may be removed by desorption from the metalloaluminophosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, calcination of the formulated molecular sieve catalyst composition is carried out in any number of well known devices including rotary calciners, fluid bed calciners, batch ovens, and the like. Calcination time is typically dependent on the degree of hardening of the molecular sieve catalyst composition and the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the molecular sieve catalyst composition is heated in nitrogen at a temperature of from about 600&deg; C. to about 700 C. Heating is carried out for a period of time typically from 30 minutes to 15 hours, preferably from 1 hour to about 10 hours, more preferably from about 1 hour to about 5 hours, and most preferably from about 2 hours to about 4 hours. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Treatment and ageing of SAPO-34 with Amines </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The SAPO-34 was activated (calcined) prior to the modification. Calcination was performed in a muffle furnace at 625&deg; C. for 4 hours under ambient air (heating rate: 5&deg; C./min). The calcined SAPO-34 was transferred into a vessel and mixed with heptylamine, triethylamine or decylamine and then stored in contact with the amine for a period of 30 minutes to 60 minutes under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. The treated SAPO-34 was then recovered from the amine and allowed to dry under nitrogen at room temperature before testing. All of these amines have kinetic diameters, which are greater than the diameter of the pores of the SAPO-34 molecular sieve. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the effect of amine treatment on methanol conversion. The amine treated examples all demonstrate an improved methanol conversion activity after three days ageing when compared to the untreated SAPO-34. Their activity is comparable to the fresh sample of SAPO-34 indicating that despite using amines with a kinetic diameter greater than the pore of the molecular sieve the important Broensted acid sites have been protected from hydrolytic attack during ageing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The methanol adsorption capacity is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The methanol adsorption capacity is given as weight percent. This percentage is the increase in weight of the calcined SAPO-34 after methanol uptake, relative to the weight of the calcined SAPO-34 before methanol uptake. This data clearly shows that the untreated SAPO-34 looses its methanol adsorption capacity rapidly with ageing. However the treatment with amines shows a significant improvement in methanol adsorption capacity on ageing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The data clearly shows that amine treatment protects the SAPO-34 from the effects of hydrolytic ageing. </paragraph>
