<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a pump with an axial fluid conduit. In one embodiment, the pump of the present invention may include an outer housing and an inner housing positioned within the outer housing. The axial fluid conduit may be defined between the inner housing and the outer housing. A motor may be positioned within the inner housing and an impeller positioned within the fluid conduit and connected to the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures, and, in particular, to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, one embodiment will be described. In this embodiment, the pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include an outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> positioned within outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be defined between outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be positioned within inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> positioned within fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and connected to motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The connection may be any attachment known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any material(s) that render pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sufficiently durable for its intended application and provide a suitable outer wall for fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a lightweight, inexpensive, durable, and fluid-tight material. Outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also be shaped such that it is not cumbersome. For example, outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be ergonomically designed. Materials for construction of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> include a wide variety of relatively rigid thermoplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or acrylonitrile-butadiene-sytrene (ABS). However, outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also be constructed of other materials, such as metals, metal alloys, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any shape capable of containing an inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed generally cylindrically. In some embodiments, outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be larger (e.g., have a larger diameter) where it contains inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and smaller (e.g., have a smaller diameter) at an inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have been labeled arbitrarily and that fluid can be moved through pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in either direction. For example, pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be operated in a first direction to push air from inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or in a second direction to pull air from outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed to facilitate air flow into fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed to prevent blockage of inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes protrusions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to inhibit blockage of inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also be constructed to prevent foreign objects from contacting impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For example, inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed to have multiple small openings that are relatively difficult for a foreign object, such as a finger, to enter. In a preferred embodiment, protrusions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are constructed as slats, inhibiting foreign objects from contacting impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be constructed to provide fluid to a desired location. For example, outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be constructed to provide fluid to an inflatable device. In one embodiment, outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes structure to lock to an inlet of an inflatable device and to bias a valve of the inlet to an open position when the pump is moving fluid to the inflatable device. In another embodiment, the pump may include a solenoid to bias open the valve when the pump is adding fluid to, drawing fluid from, the inflatable device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be constructed in any manner and of any material(s) that are suitable for containment within outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for serving as the inner wall of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and for containing motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed to fit within outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so as to provide the fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed such that it is evenly spaced from an inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The shape of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be selected to be compatible with the shape of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, where outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is generally cylindrical, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be generally cylindrical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be constructed to securely contain motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include internal structure to maintain motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a desired location. Inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include structure to hold motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a desired location without allowing undesired vibration or noise. In one embodiment, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be constructed to contain one or more batteries to provide electrical power to motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed of any material(s) sufficiently durable to contain motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and suitable for use with the fluid to be pumped. For example, inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed out of any of the same materials as outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be defined by the construction of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may provide sufficient space for fluid flow, so as not to create a significant pressure drop. Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also be regular in shape and substantially free of irregularities that may interfere with efficient fluid flow, potentially creating turbulence, noise and pressure loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include structure to improve the flow of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enhance pressurization. Improving the flow through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may decrease turbulence and generally result in a pump that is quieter and more efficient. Flow is preferably directed such that the fluid is not forced to make any sudden changes in direction. Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is generally axial in direction and impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will generally impart a rotational force on the fluid relative to the axis of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, any structure included to improve the flow of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed so as to not inhibit the generally axial movement of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may allow for the rotation of fluid within fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Inefficient fluid flow is preferred to be avoided throughout the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the pump is provided with structure to improve the flow of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enhance pressurization, the structure occupying a majority of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The structure for improving the fluid flow preferably occupies at least 75% of the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, even more preferably 90% of the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and most preferably substantially all of the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, improving flow throughout fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration, what is meant by the structure occupies a majority of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is that the structure extends at least half way through the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, not that it fills more than half the void space in fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A structure occupying the majority of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially different from an arrangement that simply directs fluid from an impeller into an open fluid conduit because it controls the fluid flow through a greater portion of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and thus is better able to improve fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, structure to improve the flow of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enhance pressurization includes one or more structures that direct flow of fluid. For example, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shaped to improve fluid flow through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be constructed to direct fluid flow within fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to bridge fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from an inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to an outer surface of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, forcing fluid to flow through the channels defined by the vanes. However, it should be understood that vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> need not extend between the inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer surface of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in all embodiments, or throughout the entire fluid conduit in such embodiments where they do so extend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be constructed to minimize any abrupt changes in fluid flow associated with inefficient flow and increased pressure drop. For example, vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be swept in a direction of the rotation imparted by impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and may direct the flow generally axially along fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, in one embodiment, vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> straighten along the length of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, allowing them to gradually redirect the air from primarily rotational movement to primarily axial movement. Vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are preferably free of any rough edges or dead end pockets that may increase fluid resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that structure to improve the flow of fluid through fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enhance pressurization may be particularly useful where fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is relatively narrow. For example, where it is desired to make pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> portable, yet powerful, it may be desired to make inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relatively large to house a larger motor, while making outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> relatively small to reduce the overall size of the device. In such an embodiment, fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be relatively narrow. For example, the average distance between an inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to an outer surface of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may preferably be about 25%, more preferably about 10%, even more preferably about 5%, or less of the average diameter of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the average distance between the inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outer surface of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is about 8% of the average diameter of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The narrowness of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may itself act as a structure to improve the flow of fluid, directing it axially along the fluid conduit, rather than allowing it to enter a relatively open area. Accordingly, a narrow fluid conduit may be sufficient is some embodiments to reduce inefficient flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also include structure to maintain the shape of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, fluid conduit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include structure to secure inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this structure may include one or more struts connecting an inner surface of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outer surface of inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, one or more vanes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serve to both direct the fluid flow and maintain the relationship between the inner and outer housings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be any device capable of rotating impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to produce fluid flow through pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be a conventional electric motor. In one embodiment, motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably an efficient, lightweight motor. Motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be relatively small, to reduce the overall size of pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, it is to be appreciated that even for a small overall size pump, the motor may still be relatively large compared to the overall size of the pump where it is desired to provide more pumping power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any material(s) that allow impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to move fluid when rotated by motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be constructed with fins capable of forcing fluid into or out of pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, depending on the direction of rotation of impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made of any material capable of maintaining a desired shape of impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For example, impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be constructed of durable and lightweight material that is compatible with the fluid to be used in pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, impeller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a thermoplastic, such as those mentioned for use in construction of outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, according to the present invention pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used in a variety of ways. For example, pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be an independent device, such as a hand holdable pump, and may be placed in contact or connected with an inflatable device when it is desired to inflate the device, typically at a valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into the inflatable device, detachably or permanently. One example embodiment of a pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the example embodiment, pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be connected to a substantially fluid impermeable bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in an inflatable device. Where pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be configured so that it does not interfere with the use of the inflatable device. For example the inflatable device may be constructed with pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> recessed into bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Where pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is recessed within bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, it is an advantage of this embodiment that pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will not interfere with the use of the inflatable device. For example, the exterior profile (total volume and shape) of pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the inflated device in combination may be substantially the same as the exterior profile of the inflated device absent the combination, thus reducing the opportunity for pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to impact or interfere with the use of the inflatable device. For example, where pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located within bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in a mattress application, it allows an inflatable standard sized mattress to fit into a standard sized bed frame. Where pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located within bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, it may be sized such that it will not come into contact with bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> when bladder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is inflated, except at the point(s) of connection. Accordingly, the pump of the present invention, which may be constructed so as to be small and hand-holdable, may be useful in such an application. For additional information regarding incorporating pumps at least partially within a bladder, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/859,706, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An embedded pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be powered by conventional household current or by battery power. It should also be understood that pump <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be a hand holdable pump that is detachable from the inflatable device and is configured to mate with the inflatable device and to be embedded substantially within the bladder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may house other structure in addition to inner housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, outer housing may include fluid control structure such as valves. Valves may be operated manually, by using a solenoid, or using other conventional techniques. The structure to operate the valve may also be included within outer housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Having thus described certain embodiments of the present invention, various alterations, modifications and improvements will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such alterations, variations and improvements are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example and is not intended to be limiting. The present invention is limited only as defined in the following claims and the equivalents thereto.</paragraph>
