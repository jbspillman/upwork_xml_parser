<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method of coordinating a visual display with audio advertisements broadcast over a communications network such as the Internet is provided. A run-time procedure in which the visual display is retrieved and concurrently displayed at about the time the audio advertisement is broadcast is described. In addition, a set-up procedure, in which scheduled broadcast times for the audio advertisements are captured and provided for use in scheduling the broadcasts of the corresponding visual displays, is also described. The system and method can be beneficially employed in other environments, such as the case in which a first audio, visual, or audiovisual segment or stream is coordinated with a predetermined second audio, visual, or audiovisual segment or stream, and a selected one of the first and second segments or streams includes or comprises advertising material. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> As communications networks such as the Internet have become prevalent as a means of communication in today&apos;s society, and desktop and laptop computers have proliferated within the home and office, many have begun to consider the Internet as yet another broadcast medium with which to reach consumers. Indeed, due to the potential for growth of the Internet, many have come to view it as a broadcast medium that rivals in importance traditional media such as radio broadcasting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As part of this effort, a development is underway by companies such as broadcast.com, www.broadcast.com, to provide broadcasts over the Internet from sources such as radio stations. Further information concerning broadcasting audio information over computer networks is available in &ldquo;BROADCAST AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND METHOD,&rdquo; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/961,314, filed Nov. 5, 1996, and &ldquo;AUDIO CONTENT PLAYER METHODS, SYSTEMS, AND ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE,&rdquo; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/976,971, filed Nov. 25, 1997, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The efforts of companies such as broadcast.com have yet to tap into the enormous potential of the Internet as an advertising medium. For example, in the case of audio broadcasts over the Internet, audio advertisements are simply broadcast over the Internet with no effort being made to coordinate the audio advertisement with a visual display or other interaction with the user. Consequently, the impact of the audio advertisement is limited, and the opportunity to generate a targeted response, such as an impulse purchase, through a coordinated audio-visual display is wasted. The end result is lost advertising revenue as advertisers are unwilling to pay significant additional money simply for broadcasts of audio advertisements over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At the same time, the difficulty of coordinating and integrating visual displays with advertisements over the Internet is compounded by the lack of an integrated broadcast scheduler for visual and related audio advertisements. Although broadcast schedulers are available for handling audio broadcasts, such as that from Marketron, Inc. of Ketchum, Id., and other schedulers are available for handling on-line visual or banner advertisements, such as that from NetGravity, Washington, D.C., no one system is available for handling both audio and visual advertising broadcasts over the Internet. The cost of entering redundant data into two different systems and the risk that the schedules maintained by the two systems may become unsynchronized provides a significant deterrent to any attempt to coordinate visual and audio advertisements over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the subject invention to provide a means for coordinating broadcasts of visual displays or advertisements with broadcasts of related audio advertisements over a communications network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An additional object is a means for enabling the coordination of broadcasts of visual displays or advertisements with broadcasts of related audio advertisements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object is a means to increase the impact of audio advertisements broadcast over communications networks such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object is an integrated system for scheduling and coordinating broadcasts of visual and audio advertisements over a communications network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object is an interface between a preexisting system for managing broadcasts of audio advertisements with a preexisting system for managing on-line displays over a communications network of visual or banner advertisements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object is a means to allow the use of preexisting systems for scheduling broadcasts of audio advertisements to also perform scheduling of broadcasts of visual advertisements over communications networks such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further objects include utilization or achievement of the foregoing objects, alone or in combination. Additional objects and advantages are set forth in the description, which follows, or will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art who practice the invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">1. EXAMPLE ENVIRONMENT OF THE SUBJECT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An example environment in which the subject invention may be beneficially employed is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably, this environment is an example of the inventions described in &ldquo;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COORDINATING SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS WITH BROADCAST MATERIAL,&rdquo; Lyon &amp; Lyon Dkt. No. 237/092, &ldquo;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING BROADCAST MATERIAL HISTORY,&rdquo; Lyon &amp; Lyon Dkt. No. 237/093, and &ldquo;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PLAYING SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS WITH BROADCAST MATERIAL,&rdquo; Lyon &amp; Lyon Dkt. No. 237/172, each of which is owned by the assignee of the subject application, and each of which is filed on even date herewith. Each of these applications is incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full. This description is provided by way of example only solely to illustrate the context in which the subject invention may be beneficially employed, and should not be continued as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, in this environment, on-air system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the type typically employed by a broadcaster such as a radio station or the like broadcasts a predetermined audio stream comprising a predetermined sequence of songs interspersed with one or more audio advertisements. In one example, the on-air system is a commercially available system such as ENCO or Prophet commonly used by radio stations and the like. The on-air system transmits this audio information over the airwaves through antenna <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and also provides it in digital form over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to encoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Concurrently, the on-air system also provides over signal line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> data in the form of identifying indicia or codes such as cut codes. The codes are indicators of the audio information concurrently being transmitted over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, each song or advertisement comprising the audio information being concurrently transmitted over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a distinct segment. A cut code or cut number corresponding to and uniquely identifying a segment from the standpoint of the radio station is transmitted over signal line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> concurrently with the transmission of the corresponding segment over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. (For purposes of this disclosure, the phrases &ldquo;cut code&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut number&rdquo; or &ldquo;cut &num;&rdquo; will be used synonymously). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Encoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is configured to compress the audio information received over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the encoder can be implemented using a commercially available encoding scheme such as, for example, the &ldquo;Active Streaming Format&rdquo; from Microsoft Netshow, or the &ldquo;SureStream&rdquo; G2 encoding scheme from Real. Advantageously, the encoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is part of a coordinating encoder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> configured to merge the cut codes provided over signal line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with the audio information provided over signal line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to provide a merged data stream over signal line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The encoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> under the control of the coordinating encoder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> performs this merging procedure. Advantageously, in this procedure, a cut code is inserted into the merged stream throughout the audio segment it identifies. In one embodiment, Radowave.com, the assignee of the subject application, provides the coordinating encoder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The audio information transmitted from antenna <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is advantageously received by one or more traditional RF receivers (not shown) configured in the form of radios and the like. This process is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and need not be described further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the merged stream is provided over signal line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to one or more broadcast servers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In one variant, the transmission of the merged data to the broadcast servers is accomplished through a wireless interface rather than a signal line. Advantageously, in one embodiment, the servers are provided by broadcast.com, of Dallas, Tex., www.broadcast.com, and are configured to simply broadcast the merged stream over a communications network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided which executes on a client computer or other end use device within the communications network. Alternatively, the player is a web-based player resident on a server in the network, but accessible through the client machine. The player is configured to receive the merged stream over signal line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and play the audio component thereof through speakers or the like (not shown) configured as part of the client computer/end user device. In addition, the player is advantageously associated with the radio station or other broadcaster associated with on-air system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such that the identity of the radio station or other broadcaster is known to the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The player is also configured to detect the presence of a cut code in the merged stream, and responsive to detecting the presence of a cut code identifying a song, signal another server on the network identified with numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. (The response of the player to detecting the presence of a cut code identifying an advertisement is detailed in the next section). In one embodiment, upon detecting a cut code identifying a song, the player is configured to provide server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the identity of radio station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as well as the cut code that has been detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, in one embodiment, server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided by RadioWave.com, the assignee of the subject application, and is configured in accordance with the invention described in the concurrently filed Lyon &amp; Lyon Dkt. Nos. 237/092, 237/093, and 237/172, previously incorporated herein by reference. Responsive to the receipt of a station ID and a cut code identifying a song, the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> accesses one or more tables. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> first accesses a song table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the entries of which correlate a station ID and cut code with an ID of the album containing the song, the name of the artist, the album name, and the song name. Through this step, the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> obtains the album ID for the album containing the song associated with the cut code and station ID that was previously sent to the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> accesses a provider table <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, the entries of this table correlate the album ID with (1) a name of an image related to the cut or segment, such as but not limited to an image of the cover of the album or tape containing the song; (2) a provider link, i.e., a URL or other link to additional information related to the song or album, such as a link to a server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a fulfillment provider; (3) the artist name; (4) album name; and (5) song name. In one example, by accessing this table, the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> obtains the name of an image file of the album or tape cover containing the song, the artist name, the album name, the song name, and the record label. In one implementation, the fulfillment provider server is that of Amazon, Inc. at www.amazon.com, and the link to this server is a URL link known as an ASIN&num;. In one embodiment, server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> obtains the actual image for the album cover, which is either stored locally or on another server accessible from server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and then provides the image, song name, artist name, and album name to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provides the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a link to the image stored on another server, and, responsive to this information, the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> obtains the actual image for the album cover, or other related image, from fulfillment provider server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the event that there is not an entry in the provider table <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for the album ID obtained from the song table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the artist name, album name, and song name are obtained from the song table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. That is the reason why entries for this information are redundantly provided in both the song table <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provider table <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this event, song name, artist name, and album name are provided to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but the provider link is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Responsive to the receipt of the artist name, album name, song name, image, and provider link (this last item of information being provided only in the case in which there is an entry for the album in the provider table) are then provided to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving this information, the player displays it through a suitable display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example of such a display is illustrated. As can be seen, the display includes a web-based component <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in which is displayed the image <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the album cover for the song that is currently being played, the name <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the artist of the song, the name <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the song, and the name <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the album in which the song is contained. In addition, around the web-based display component is a border <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is advantageously stored locally on the client machine. Displayed within or at the border <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is an identifier <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for the radio station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from which the audio information being broadcast originates, and an indicator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the quality of the signal, and the elapsed listening time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a history component <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is displayed below the web-based component. This component contains information about the audio segments that have been played by the player in the recent past. In the illustrated embodiment, the history information is displayed with the most recent information beginning at the left, and the less recent information being arranged towards the right. As can be seen, the information is displayed is the image associated with the segment. Also, images can be displayed both for songs and advertisements that have aired. Starting from the left, it can be seen that an image <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from a Fleetwood Mac album cover is displayed, indicating that a song from this album was most recently played. This is followed by images for advertisements, which have aired, from Sprint, McDonalds, and Sony. The image for the McDonalds advertisement is identified with numeral <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Next, image <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for a Beatles album cover is displayed, indicating that a song from this album was played. As audio information is played, this history information is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is also displayed. When a user clicks on this button <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> link is established to a program resident on fulfillment provider server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the provider link provided by the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As discussed, in one example, the fulfillment provider server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is www.amazon.com, and the provider link is an ASIN&num; which is a URL link to this server. Once this link is established, in one embodiment, a browser is launched allowing a user to peruse information resident on server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and purchase the album containing the song being played or related albums. Alternatively, the user is allowed access to this information through a feature window displayed by the player. In one example, the link to server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is established simply by appending the provider link to the URL of the server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this example, it is assumed that the URL of the server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is known to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but it should be appreciated that examples are possible in which this URL information is provided to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that examples are possible in which server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provides other links associated with the song being played to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. One such example is a URL or other link to information describing the concert tour schedule of the artist of the song being aired, and a program allowing the user to purchase tickets to one of these concerts. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a user clicks on a &ldquo;tours and tickets&rdquo; identifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the link to this information can be established, and a browser launched or other mechanism such as a feature window initiated allowing the user to peruse this information. Another example is a URL or other link to information describing other albums by the artist of the song currently being played. Again with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a user clicks on an &ldquo;artist archives&rdquo; identifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the link to this information can be established, and a browser launched or other mechanism initiated, such as a feature window, allowing the user to peruse this information. A third example is a URL or other link to information about a product or service being advertised. According to this example, an advertisement regarding a product or service is displayed within web-based component <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When a user clicks on this information, a URL or other link can be established to a server configured to provide additional information about this product or service, and a browser launched or other mechanism initiated, such as a feature window, to allow a user to peruse this information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The above is provided by way of example only, and it should be appreciated that other environments are possible allowing beneficial employment of the subject invention, including the more generic examples described in the foregoing Lyon &amp; Lyon Dkt. Nos. 237/092, 237/093, and 237/172, filed on even date herewith, and previously incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 2. Embodiments of the Subject Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the process of coordinating visual displays with audio advertisements broadcast over the Internet can include both a run-time component <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a set-up component <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The run-time component of this process will first be described, followed by the set-up component <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives over signal line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a merged stream of audio data and digital data in which the audio data comprises audio segments, such as songs or advertisements, and the digital data comprises cut codes and the like uniquely identifying each segment from the standpoint of the radio station or other broadcaster associated with on-air system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, a cut code is inserted in the stream throughout the audio segment it identifies. However, embodiments are possible in which the cut codes bear other known relationship to the segments they identify. The subject invention includes means to coordinate visual displays or advertisements with broadcast content being played over the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as is described in the foregoing example environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in which, compared to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, like elements are referenced with like identifying numerals, when a cut code identifying an audio advertisement is detected by player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an access is made to a server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> over signal line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the cut code and station ID are both provided to the server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is distinct from the servers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but it should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which each of these servers are combined into one or more physical servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Responsive to the receipt of this information, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> accesses advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on which is resident data correlating the cut code and station ID to a contract &num; or contract ID identifying the contract between an advertiser and the radio station or other broadcaster. (For purposes of this disclosure, the phrases &ldquo;contract &num;,&rdquo; &ldquo;contract ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract number&rdquo; will be used synonymously). In one embodiment, this contract can govern information such as, for example, the advertisement at hand, the name of the advertiser, the product or service being advertised, the &ldquo;flight&rdquo; dates for the advertisement, i.e., the dates over which the advertisement is scheduled to run, the image name, i.e., the name of an image, such as a gif image, to be displayed at or about the same time the corresponding audio advertisement is run, and the redirect link, i.e., a URL or other link to a server from which the user can obtain additional information about the product or service being advertised if desired. In one embodiment, this data is maintained by a system, such that that provided by NetGravity, Inc., of Washington, D.C., www.netgravity.com, for managing on-line visual or banner advertisements. In this example, this system executes on server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then compares the current date with the scheduled flight dates to ensure it is within the range of the scheduled flight dates for the advertisement. If so, the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then initiates a series of operations such that the image is displayed by the player at about the same time the related audio advertisement segment, i.e., the audio segment in the merged stream that corresponds to the cut code, is being broadcast. If not, the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> refrains from initiating this series of operations, it being assumed that the contract calls for the advertisement to be played in audio form only without a corresponding visual display or that the time called for coordinating a visual display with the audio advertisement has expired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the current date is-within the scheduled flight dates, in one embodiment, the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then arranges to have provided to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a link to the actual image for the visual display as well as the redirect link, and the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then retrieves the actual image from image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over signal line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Optionally, server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> arranges to have other information provided to the player, such as the name of the advertiser, and the name of the product or service being advertised. In one embodiment, additional information can be provided, such as an image of a coupon or the like indicating a discount or other promotion being offered by the advertiser, or forms to be filled out by a user, e.g., registration or subscription forms, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a cut code in the audio stream alerts the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that an advertisement is about to be played. Player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contacts the support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provides the cut code and station ID to advertisement server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, on which is stored tables correlating the cut code and station ID to a URL or other link to the image, and the redirect URL or other link to additional information related to the advertisement. In one embodiment, the advertisement server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> looks up the cut code and station ID in these tables and returns an html page to the support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in which is embedded an image URL. Support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relays the html page, including the image URL, to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which parses the html page and extracts the image URL. Player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> locates the image URL on image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and requests the image. Image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> returns the image to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is then stored locally on the client computer terminal accessing or executing the player. In this embodiment, the advertisement server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also looks up a redirect URL or other link to additional information related to the advertisement using the station ID and cut code, and provides this to the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Responsive to the receipt of this information, the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then displays some or all of this information at the same time as the corresponding audio advertisement is being played. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, the image for the advertisement is displayed within the web page portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the visual display. Optionally, the name of the advertiser, the product or service being advertised, and other related information can also be displayed. In another embodiment, this information is displayed within portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the visual display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, if the user clicks on the image for the advertisement, a link is established over signal line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on which is resident additional information about the product or service being advertised. In one embodiment, this link is established using the redirect URL or other link provided to the player. Once the link is established, a browser is spawned or other mechanism initiated, such as a feature window in area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, allowing the user to peruse this information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a coupon or discount or price quote for the advertiser can also be displayed. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> coupon can be implemented through suitable entries in the tables maintained by advertisement server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When a cut code for the advertisement is detected, a link to an image for the coupon resident either on server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or even external server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> would be provided to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for display in a manner similar to that already described in relation to the image for the advertisement itself. Optionally, the player is configured to allow the coupon to be printed. Also, forms can be displayed which the user can fill out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The set-up portion of this process and system will now be described. As is known, radio stations employ an individual known as the Continuity Director whose job it is to ensure that advertisements are broadcast at the scheduled dates called for in the contract with the advertiser, that the appropriate advertising copy is broadcast, and that the advertiser is appropriately billed for these services. To manage this process for audio broadcasts, the Continuity Director typically uses one of the available traffic systems provided by companies such as Marketron, Inc., of Ketchum, Id., or Custom Business Systems, Inc. (CBSI) of Reedsport, Oreg. (Additional information about the Marketron system, Marketron&apos;s Traffic and Accounting System, is available at www.marketron.com). Upon entering into a contract with an advertiser, the Continuity Director arranges to have information about the contract entered into the system. Typically, this includes information such as the contract number, the name of the advertiser, the name of the product or service being advertised, and the flight dates for the advertisement. This information is then used to manage the audio broadcasts of the advertisement, i.e., to ensure that they are broadcast at the scheduled dates, that the appropriate advertising copy is used, and that the advertiser is appropriately billed for these services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The subject invention provides a means to utilize this information for the purpose of coordinating visual displays with the audio advertisement broadcasts without requiring an additional manual entry of this information into an additional system, such as the system provided by NetGravity, Inc., of Washington, D.C., for managing on-line banner advertisements. (Additional information about the NetGravity system is available at www.netgravity.com). The means for achieving this objective is part of the subject invention and comprises the set-up process and system <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the set-up process begins as the scheduling data and the like referred to above for an audio advertisement is entered into traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In one example, this data entry is performed through the Marketron system, but it should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which other systems such as CBSI are used for this purpose. In one example, the system is embodied in the form of a series of software instructions executable on one or more machines such as a computer. For purposes of this disclosure, a computer can include any processor capable of executing a series of instructions stored in a computer readable memory or storage device. Periodically, the contents of this database can be downloaded over signal line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this downloading is performed nightly through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), but it should be appreciated that other levels of periodicity and other transfer protocols are possible. Advantageously, this data is stored by the support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in a local database <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the form of table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (although at this point, for each newly added record, in the case of the Marketron system, only the information regarding contract &num;, flight dates, advertiser, and product or service is available). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A continuity interface can be employed to augment this information. In one example, the continuity interface is embodied in the form of a web-based application in which the interface is resident on a server integrated into the network and accessible from the client machine. According to this example, in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the continuity interface is embodied in the form of computer software which executes on continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and which interacts with the user through continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Appropriate screen displays and the like are displayed on the continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to allow interaction with the user. In another example, the software is executable on a client machine integrated into the communications network. In yet another embodiment, the software is executable on a standalone machine that is capable of interacting with other machines through hard-wired or wireless links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, contract ID&apos;s and product or service names from the traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which have been stored in table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>residing on support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, are first provided to the continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on which the continuity interface is executing, and displayed on continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In one implementation, only the records from table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the Coordinate Bit is cleared, i.e., is a logical &ldquo;0,&rdquo; are made available to the continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. These records represent advertisements that have not yet been coordinated with visual information. In this implementation, advertisements which have already been coordinated with visual information have their corresponding Coordinate Bits set to a logical &ldquo;1.&rdquo; The user then selects from this group one or more contract IDs corresponding to audio advertisements for which the advertiser has purchased coordinated visuals. When the contract IDs have been selected, the corresponding information from table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is displayed for each such contract ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an example of such a display is illustrated. Advantageously, a record for each selected advertising contract is downloaded from traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a screen of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is displayed on continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for each selected advertising contract. In one embodiment, the record for each contract comprises the contract &num;, product or service name, advertiser name, and scheduled flight dates. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for each such screen, the contract &num; and product or service being advertised is displayed. Such is indicated by identifying numeral <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Advantageously, a browser feature <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>allows the user to locate the name of the image file from a file system (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) accessible from continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In addition, the name of the advertiser and the flight dates are also displayed. Such is indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Also, in one embodiment, the station logo for the radio station or other broadcaster involved, which is known to the continuity interface software, is displayed on the screen as well. Such is indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A series of prompts or blank spaces is then provided for the purpose of augmenting the information provided from traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for each record. One such prompt solicits input of the cut number inserted into the merged audio stream for the advertisement. Such is identified by numeral <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Another solicits input of the name of the image file comprising the visual display to be coordinated with the broadcast of the audio advertisement. Such is indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A third such prompt solicits input of the redirect URL or other link for linking the user with additional information about the product or service being advertised. Such is indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The user then manually inputs this information. Advantageously, as indicated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the case in which there is more than one cut or spot called for by a contract, the user is provided with an opportunity to input the data for such cut. (For purposes of this disclosure, the term &ldquo;spot&rdquo; is used synonymously with &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and refers to a particular embodiment of an advertisement for a product or service). Once the data has been entered for a contract, the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is clicked, indicating that the information that has been input should be used to update the appropriate tables in servers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The newly entered data is routed from continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> over signal line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The data is then stored on database <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) in the form of table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In one implementation, the data in tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are correlated to each other through an additional field (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), created to correlate corresponding entries in these tables. According to this implementation, tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>each have an additional column for storage of this field. Using this field, records from table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be associated with corresponding records in table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Responsive to the clicking on the commit button, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the continuity interface software then uploads over signal line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> the image file to server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which the image has been previously stored. In addition, in response to a user clicking on the commit button, the continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provides advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with all instructions and data necessary to schedule and format the display of an advertisement. This is accomplished through an application programming interface (API) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that permits the continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to communicate with the advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a programmatic manner, and that effects the transfer to advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of data from tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>resident on support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the information sent to advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes, for each spot or cut code, the station ID of the radio station involved, the cut code, the address of the image file on the image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the advertiser name, the contract ID, the product or service name, the flight dates, and the redirect URL or other link for directing the user to additional information about the product or service being advertised. In one implementation, this information is retrieved from tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and provided to API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> over signal line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This data is then inserted by API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into suitable tables resident on advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one example, these tables are maintained by a system configured to manage on-line visual or banner advertisements over the communications network, such as that provided by NetGravity, Inc., of Washington, D.C., www.netgravitv.com. This information is then available to player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to support or enable the run-time process described previously. In this embodiment, the actual file image itself is downloaded to a separate server, image server <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which the actual image file is downloaded to server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process is then repeated for each contract record downloaded from database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that has been selected by the user for coordination as described previously. When all the tables have been assembled in the manner described, the set-up process is then completed, at least for the period in question, and the run-time process described previously fully enabled. In this manner, significant redundant manual entry of this information is avoided. For example, it can be seen that the contract &num;, product or service name, advertiser name, and scheduled flight times are only manually input once&mdash;during the invocation of the software used to update database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, such as the Marketron Traffic and Accounting software discussed previously. In addition, it can further be seen that the cut code, image name, and redirect URL or other link for each spot or cut is also manually input only once in the process&mdash;during the invocation of continuity interface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through continuity workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Although embodiments are possible in which some redundant data entry is allowed, it can be seen that the objective of avoiding substantial duplicate and redundant data entry is accomplished. In addition, it can be seen that the very same scheduling information used to schedule broadcasts of audio advertisements, in the form of flight dates and the like, is used also to schedule the visual displays which accompany and are coordinated with the broadcasts of the audio information. Thus, the risk of unsynchronized schedules is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing embodiment, the traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is duplicated at least in part in the support server through the FTP transfer described, and the continuity interface is configured to interact with and utilize the duplicated data resident on support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which the continuity interface interacts directly with the traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In such embodiments, some customization of the continuity interface would be required to support the traffic systems of different vendors. Moreover, such embodiments may not be possible for use with traffic systems of vendors, such as Marketron, which do not currently support direct automated access. However, for vendors that support it, direct automated access would avoid the need to duplicate the traffic system database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A method of operation of the run-time portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> according to one embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. According to this method, a process of coordinating in real time a visual display with a corresponding audio advertisement broadcast is provided. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in accordance with this method, in step <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a cut code indicative of an advertisement is detected by player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, information associated with this cut code, including an identifier of an image (or the image itself), a redirect link, and scheduled flight dates, is retrieved from one or more servers. (If there is no information associated with this cut code, it is assumed to be an uncoordinated advertisement, that is, an advertisement which is intended to be broadcast in audio form only, without any coordination of visual display therewith). In step <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, the current date is compared with the scheduled flight dates to confirm that it is within those dates. If so, a branch is made to step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>; if not, a jump is made back to step <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the image and redirect link are provided to the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although not shown expressly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then displays the image at about the same time as the corresponding audio broadcast. In addition, the redirect link is made available to provide access to a server containing additional information about the product or service advertised should the user click on the image. Optionally, one or more additional images are provided to the player for display, including an image of a coupon or the like, as well as related links for linking to additional servers in the case in which the user clicks on these additional images. At the conclusion of this process, a jump is made back to step <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A method of operation of the set-up portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> according to one embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. According to this method, a process of enabling the coordination in real time of a visual display with a corresponding audio advertisement broadcast is provided. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, information descriptive of an advertising contract with an advertiser is input into a database. Advantageously, a contract &num;, product or service name, advertiser name, and scheduled flight dates are input. In step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, this information is augmented with additional information useful for coordinating a visual display with an audio broadcast of the advertisement. Advantageously, the information that is added can include, for each contract, one or more cut numbers, and for each cut number, an identifier of an image (or the image itself) to be displayed concurrently with the audio broadcast, and a redirect link for linking to a site in the event the user clicks on the image. In step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the foregoing information is entered into a database useful for enabling a real time coordinated visual display. In step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, this database is provided to one or more servers that are accessible by the player <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although not shown expressly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, this database is used to implement the run-time process illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Specifically, this database is used to provide the flight dates used in the comparison indicated by step <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and to also provide the image and redirect link indicated in step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which additional functionality is provided by the continuity interface software in addition to that described above regarding coordinating visual displays with corresponding audio advertisement broadcasts. For example, in one embodiment, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> means is provided to allow the continuity interface to update, delete or modify records in table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>resident on server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (within database <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and also to initiate the updating, deleting, or modifying of the corresponding records of the tables maintained on server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This might be useful in the event there is a change in a contract with an advertiser, or if the image for a spot has changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> To utilize this functionality, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> user selects the update option <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> from a menu display in which other selections are offered. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> coordinate spot option <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is also provided. This refers to the set-up system and process previously described and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>. In addition, a create spot option <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is also provided which will be described later on. These selections can also be made from the server of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and other screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, to implement the update option, a screen such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is first displayed. This screen provides a capability to search for the entries in the database corresponding to a specific contract. To use this capability, a user enters, at the location indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the contract number in question. The user then presses the search button identified with numeral <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to begin the search. The system then searches through the databases <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>resident on server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> until the records in question have been found. In one embodiment, the update option is only available with respect to coordinated spots, i.e., spots that have been coordinated with a visual display. However, it should be appreciated that embodiments are also possible in which uncoordinated spots are supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The system then displays the cuts or spots in the database that correspond to the specified contract. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the cuts corresponding to contract &num;0001, cuts 0003, 0006, and 0007, are displayed. The user is then given the opportunity to modify, add, or delete any or all of these records. Such is indicated by the option buttons <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, labeled &ldquo;modify,&rdquo; &ldquo;add,&rdquo; or &ldquo;delete,&rdquo; respectively, appearing above the display of the cuts or spots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, assuming the user clicks on the &ldquo;modify&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, indicating a desire to modify one of the spots, the modify button is highlighted, and the user is then given the opportunity to update any of the information contained in the displayed cuts or spots. For example, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, if the user wanted to change the image associated with cut &num;0003, he would simply substitute the new image name with the name indicated, i.e., &ldquo;whatson.gif.&rdquo; To implement the change, the user would then click on the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> discussed previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, assuming the user clicks on the &ldquo;add&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, indicating a desire to add a cut to the cuts associated with an existing contract, the add button is highlighted, and the user is then given the opportunity to add to the information already stored for the contract in question. The existing cuts <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> for the contract in question are displayed, and the user is then prompted to add additional cuts for the contract. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, as indicated by numerals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the user is prompted for the cut number, image name, and redirect link for any additional cuts. At the conclusion of this process, the changes can be implemented by clicking on the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> discussed previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates a process of deleting a cut associated with a contract according to one embodiment. To select this option, the user clicks on the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; button, identified in the figure with numeral <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The system then highlights the delete button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and displays the cuts associated with the contract in question. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the cuts associated with the contract in question, contract &num;0001, are displayed as indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A box is placed to the left of each cut. To delete a cut, the user clicks on the box. The system then places a check in the box to indicate that the deletion request has been recognized. Such is indicated by the checked box identified by numeral <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. To implement the change, the user then clicks on the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the manner described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> illustrate the process of creating new cuts according to one embodiment. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> user initiates this process by clicking on the &ldquo;create spot&rdquo; option <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this option is only selected as a last resort if there is a need to quickly coordinate a spot with a visual display, but there is no associated contract entered into the system. An example in which this feature might be useful is the case in which there is a desire to coordinate a spot for a contract entered into the database <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, but which has not yet been downloaded to the server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the periodic FTP process described earlier. Responsive to a user selecting the create option indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the system displays a screen such as that indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. As indicated by numerals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, The user is prompted to enter the contract &num;, flight dates, advertiser, and product or service. After doing so, the user clicks on the commit button, which initiates the display, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The advertiser and scheduled flight dates are displayed, as indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, as well as the product/service name and contract &num;, as indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The user is then prompted for the information for the cuts associated with this product/service, including cut number, image name, and redirect link. Such is indicated by numerals <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the figure. Finally, to implement the change, the user clicks on the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the manner described previously. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Some aspects of an example implementation of the subject invention will now be described. According to this implementation, advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> executes scheduling software provided by NetGravity, Inc., www.netgravity.com, of Washington, D.C. The focus of this discussion is on some of the implementation details of API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the means for interfacing with the tables maintained by the NetGravity system, and related details of tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>resident on support server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In this implementation, the fields of table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, one of the tables resident on server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As indicated, these fields include the station ID, contract ID, spot title (which is simply the name or the product or service being advertised), flight dates, advertiser name, Coordination Bit, and cut ID. The fields are identified in the figure with the names StationID, ContractID, SpotTitle, StartTime, EndTime, Advertiser, Coordinated Bit, and CutID, respectively. With the exception of CutID, each of these fields has been explained previously, and need not be described further here. The field CutID is an internal field that is used simply to correlate the records in table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with corresponding records in table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It is not synonymous and should not be confused with the cut code or cut number, the number that uniquely identifies an audio segment from the standpoint of the radio station or other broadcaster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The fields in this implementation of table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, another of the tables resident on server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. These fields are identified with the names CutID, CutNumber, StationImageURL, AudiosenseImageURL, RedirectURL, UpdateStatus, UpdateTime, and NGUpdateTime. The CutID is the field described previously used to coordinate table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. CutNumber is the cut code or cut number described previously used to identify a particular audio segment from the standpoint of the broadcaster. The field StationImageURL is used to store the file name of the image as stored on the file system of workstation <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The field AudiosenseImageURL is a link to an image for the spot resident on image server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. RedirectURL is the link to additional information about the product or service being advertised resident on server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The remaining fields are used internally and need not be described further for an understanding of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate software code which, in the example implementation, is part of the continuity interface software resident on continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This software is executed when the commit button <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> illustrated in the foregoing previously described screen shots is clicked on, invoking API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to update the tables maintained on advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> identifies a subroutine call to the CreateAd routine of API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is invoked when a user desires to either to coordinate a visual display with an audio advertisement, or create a record for such a visual display. The coordination function was described previously in relation to the screen shot illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and the create function was described previously in relation to the screen shots illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. Briefly, the coordination function correlates information input through a broadcast advertising system, such as the Marketron system, i.e., the table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>information described previously, with information input through the continuity interface, i.e., the table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>information described previously. The create function allows a user to input through the continuity interface both the information maintained in tables <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In both cases, records must be created in the tables maintained by the NetGravity system on the advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for correlating the cut number with the image link and redirect URL or other link for the advertisement, and for maintaining other information related to the advertisement, such as scheduled flight dates, advertiser name, product or service name, etc. The CreateAd routine in the API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is invoked to accomplish this objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> identifies another call to the CreateAd routine in the API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> responsive to a user desiring to add a record for a cut or spot. As described previously in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the add function allows a user to input into table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>additional records for a contract ID and product/service combination. The CreateAd routine is invoked to add these additional records to the tables maintained by the NetGravity system on advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> identifies a call to the UpdateAd routine in the API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> responsive to a user selecting the modify function. As previously described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the modify function allows a user to update records of table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for a contract ID/product or service combination. The UpdateAd routine simply updates the corresponding table(s) maintained by the NetGravity system on advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with this updated information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> identifies a call to the DeleteAd routine in the API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> responsive to a user selecting the delete function. As previously described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the delete function allows a user to delete from table <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>records for a contract/product or service combination. The DeleteAd routine simply deletes the corresponding records from the table(s) maintained by the NetGravity system on advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>illustrate software code which is part of the front-end of API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, i.e., the portion of the code which responds to the functions initiated through the software in the continuity interface illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this implementation, this code is resident on continuity server <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>although it is part of API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> rather than the continuity interface that is also resident on this server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, numeral <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> identifies the four principal routines embodied by this code: the CreateAd, UpdateAd, DeleteAd, and CreateFamilyRun routines. The CreateAd, UpdateAd, and DeleteAd routines are the same routines that have already been described above in relation to the software illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Again, the purpose of these routines is simply to perform the front-end tasks needed to implement the create, coordinate, modify, add, and delete functions initiated by a user. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the code which embodies the CreateAd routine is the section of code beginning with the code identified with numeral <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the code which embodies the UpdateAd routine is the section of code beginning with the code identified with numeral <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Also with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the code which embodies the DeleteAd routine is the section of code beginning with the code identified with numeral <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The CreateFamilyRun routine is employed to update the tables in the advertising server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the scheduled flight dates for an advertisement. In the example implementation, it is invoked only after a successful invocation of the CreateAd function, but is not independently invoked. Thus, in this implementation, the process of coordinating a visual display with an audio advertisement is a two-step process. First, entries for the visual display are created using the CreateAd routine. Second, after this has been successfully accomplished, the display of the visual material is scheduled using the CreateFamilyRun routine. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the section of code which embodies the CreateFamilyRun routine begins with the code identified with numeral <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Other front-end functions are performed by the code sections listed on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, but, since they are not necessary to understand the invention, need not be explained further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>functionally describe the back-end tasks performed by API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. These back-end tasks are performed responsive to the front-end tasks performed by the code of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, which are themselves performed responsive to user commands initiated through the continuity interface. These back-end tasks are the specific tasks performed to update the tables maintained by the NetGravity system in the example implementation. The tables maintained by the NetGravity system are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are listings of the software routines which embody the back-end tasks performed by API <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the foregoing implementation. These routines are referred to in the functional description provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>The following table correlates the figure numbers with these back-end routines:

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that there are many other embodiments, or variants of embodiments that are within the scope of the subject invention. For example, embodiments are possible in which links between elements are provided through means such as wireless communications links rather than the signal lines described in the foregoing embodiments. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>, any of the signal lines used to link the various elements together can be provided through wireless links. In addition, embodiments are possible in which the audio broadcasts and coordinated visual displays occur over communications networks other than the Internet such as, for example, local area networks, private or secure networks, or publicly available networks other than the Internet. In addition, embodiments are possible in which visual displays which are or include advertising material are coordinated with audio information that is not and does not include advertising material. For example, consider a situation in which it is desired to display a McDonald&apos;s visual advertisement during the time that a particular Metallica song is being played. The cut code for the song can be detected, and the visual display for the McDonald&apos;s advertisement displayed in accordance with the invention. In addition, embodiments are possible in which it is desired to coordinate a visual display that is not and does not include advertising material with an audio broadcast that is or includes an advertisement. Consider an example in which it is desired to display information about a Metallica album at the time that an audio broadcast of a McDonald&apos;s advertisement is occurring. The cut code for the McDonald&apos;s advertisement can be detected, and the image of the Metallica album displayed at about the same time that the advertisement is broadcast in accordance with the subject invention. Further, although the foregoing embodiments have been described in terms of coordinating visual information with a predetermined audio sequence or stream, it should be appreciated that embodiments are possible in which a first audio, visual, or audiovisual segment or stream is coordinated with a second predetermined audio, visual, or audiovisual segment or stream, including any and all combinations of the foregoing. One example that is expressly contemplated is supplementing &ldquo;line&rdquo; broadcasts with real time audio or visual coordinated information. </paragraph>
