<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An apparatus consistent with the present invention relates to a door device and, more particularly, to a door device capable of moving freely in a narrow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a door device is disposed at a collecting case such as a TV decorative case. The above door device needs to have a predetermined space in relation to opening and closing of the door device when formed as a hinged type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the hinged type door device can cause inconvenience for a user due to an opened door when the user opens the door. For solving the problem, a door device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been applied to a collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The door device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a hinge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for opening and closing an open area <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for supporting the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be slid into the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The hinge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>rotates and slides on the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed at an interior wall of the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should have a longer length than at least a height of the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be completely inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the above construction, to open the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a user rotates the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> about 90&deg; to a direction of A as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Then, the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is maintained in parallel to the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, if the user pushes the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to a direction B, the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is completely inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the open area <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the collecting case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional door device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the above construction, the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> should be lifted for about 90&deg; so that the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be inserted along the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the conventional door device cannot be used in a narrow space, since there should be enough space for moving the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through 90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the length of the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is long, the rail <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should be long also. Thus, there is a limitation in the height of the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, there is a problem of degrading a product by applying the door device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, due to a rigid action that the user rotates the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> and pushes the door <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> over and over again. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> door device according to an illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention comprises a collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; a door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for opening and closing an opening of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; a first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> installed at the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; and first and second guide rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a predetermined space defined therein such as a TV embracing case and a general decorative case. The collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an opening that is opened and closed by the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A support bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is installed at one side of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for supporting the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A first support unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is installed at an upper part of the support bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for supporting the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a second support unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is installed at a lower part of the support bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for supporting the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thus, the first and the second hinges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are disposed up and down at the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a predetermined distance from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The first and the second guide rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are disposed at a support panel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> disposed at an interior wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this case, each guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be formed at the interior wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without forming the separate support panel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is sloped downwardly from the opening to an inside of the collecting case for a predetermined length. The first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> guides the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to move into and out from the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opened and closed. Thus, an upper part of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves into and out from the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is moved along the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In addition, a stopper <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is disposed at an interior end of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for preventing the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from moving when the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opened. The first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is forcefully slid into the stopper <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> when the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contacts with the stopper <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is placed at the end of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be formed at the support panel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by making a groove for a predetermined depth and a length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is sloped upwardly from the opening to the inside of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for a predetermined length. The second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a greater sloping degree compared to the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the length of the second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is about a half of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> guides movement and rotation of the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can rotate while moving out from the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opened, firstly, the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> alone rotates, and the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates and slides along the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Then, after rotation of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for a certain degree, the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotates and slides on the second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> changes its location, and also the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates and slides. Accordingly, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by rotating in close contact to the upper part of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opened. The second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also can be formed at the support panel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by making a groove for a predetermined depth and a length in a manner similar to the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described above, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially opened by a two-step open action. For this end, preferably, but not necessarily, the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a first curved part <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for guiding a movement of the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at the first step as the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is centering about the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a second curved part <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for guiding a movement of the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> then rotates and slides after the first step is finished. Therefore, the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is the shape of a repeated curve, and the second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is linear in shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The description of the door device according to the illustrative embodiment of the present invention is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> First of all, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is rotated in a direction of A for opening the opening of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Next, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> firstly, rotates in the direction of &lsquo;A&rsquo; about the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. At this time, as the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves along the first curved part <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the upper part of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for a predetermined depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> further rotates in the direction of A after rotating for a certain degree, then the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves along the second guide rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In addition, the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves along the second curved part <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Thus, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates about the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and simultaneously the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves to a ceiling of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and an upper part of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is entirely inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. That is, the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is rotated about 90&deg; from its original position and inserted to a close contact to the inside ceiling of the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the first hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is stopped by the stopper <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> formed at the end of the first guide rail <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, so that the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> does not free fall even when the user does not hold the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while in the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as described above, since the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> operates in two steps: the first step being that the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> alone rotates about the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the second step being that the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates and moves about the second hinge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the opening action of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is very smooth and can be easily operated with a minor effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates and at the same time is inserted into the collecting case <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the operating space of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the outer side thereof can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the first and the second guide rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are grooves formed at the support panel <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, but it is only an example. Thus, the first and the second guide rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be formed by disposing a rail member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the door device of the present invention having the above construction, as the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed to be rotated and simultaneously pushed to be opened and closed, the opening and closing of the door body is soft and natural. Thus, the level of the product having the door device of the present invention is upgraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by reducing the rotation range of the door body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the place for installing the product is not limited, and the product can be placed in a narrow place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that numerous modifications may be made to the door device of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
