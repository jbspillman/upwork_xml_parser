<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of reducing a nitrogen oxide (NOx) in a hybrid inflator and a hybrid inflator in which a generated amount of nitrogen oxide (NOx) is reduced. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a pyrotechnic inflator which inflates an air bag with a combustion gas from a gas generating agent, NOx is always produced because of a fuel component such as a nitrogen-containing compound or the like, and it is demanded to reduce a generated amount of NOx in view of safety of a passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a hybrid inflator inflates an air bag with an inert gas such as argon, helium, and, since a gas generating agent is used to increase an internal pressure, an amount of use thereof is less than that in the pyrotechnic inflator. Therefore, a problem caused by NOx generation is not so overt in the hybrid inflator as compared with the case of the pyrotechnic inflator, however, there is a demand for reducing an amount of NOx even in the hybrid inflator in view of further enhancing safety to a vehicle occupant and particularly protecting the weak such as infants or the aged. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a method of reducing NOx generated in actuation of a hybrid inflator and a hybrid inflator in which a generated amount of NOx is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Though the applicant of the present invention previously filed an invention relating to a hybrid inflator which can achieve further reduction in size and weight (specification of Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-290236), the present invention has improved the previous invention and further applied an excellent NOx reducing effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces a generated amount of NOx by causing NOx to react with radicals, such as NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>radicals, NCO radicals, CN radicals, alkyl radicals generated from a reducing compound to change a portion of NOx to N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, as a solving means, a method of reducing nitrogen oxide which is generated in actuation of a hybrid inflator, comprising the step of placing a reducing compound having at least a reducing function of a nitrogen oxygen in the hybrid inflator for an inflatable safety system of a vehicle provided with an airbag, comprising an inflator housing charged with a pressurized medium, a gas generator which is accommodated in the inflator housing and has one or two or more gas generating chambers storing a gas generating agent including a fuel and an oxidizing agent, and an igniting means connected to the gas generator,. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, as other solving means, a hybrid inflator for an inflatable safety system of a vehicle provided with an airbag, which comprises an inflator housing charged with a pressurized medium, a gas generator accommodated in the inflator housing and having one or at least two gas generating chambers which store a gas generating agent including a fuel and an oxidizing agent, and an igniting means connected to the gas generator, wherein the gas generating agent has a gas generating function and a nitrogen oxide reducing function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a pressurized medium such as an inert gas is employed in the hybrid inflator including a gas generating agent as a means inflate an inflatable body such as an air bag. And the present invention includes a hybrid inflator which increases an internal pressure with a gas generating agent, and also a hybrid inflator which increases an internal pressure with a gas generating agent and utilizes a combustion gas as an inflating means of an inflatable body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the method of reducing a nitrogen oxide of a hybrid inflator according to the present invention and the hybrid inflator using the same, it is desirable that the mole ratio (A/B) of an amount (A mol) of the pressurized medium and an amount (B mol) of gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent is adjusted to preferably 8/2 to 1/9, and more preferably 8/2 to 3/7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The pressurized medium can be a composition comprising an inert gas such as argon, helium, a nitrogen gas or the like. In this case, the argon works to promote the thermal expansion of the pressurized medium and, if the helium is included, the leakage of the pressurized medium can be detected easily so that distribution of the imperfect products can be prevented, which is preferable. In addition to the above-described composition, the pressurized medium can include oxygen to further promote a combustion and oxidize CO, hydrogen or the like to CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or the like. The specific composition of the pressurized medium including oxygen is determined depending on an amount and a kind of the adopted gas generating agent, but it is preferable that the oxygen content is 30 mole % or less. The charged pressure of the pressurized medium (&equals;a pressure in the inflator housing) is preferably 10,000 to 70,000 kPa, and more preferably 30,000 to 60,000 kPa. The gas generating agent can include one generally used in a hybrid inflator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As described above, by adjusting the mole ratio of the amount of the pressurized medium charged in the hybrid inflator and the amount of gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent, the amount of the pressurized medium charged can be reduced. Thereby, even when the volume of the housing is decreased (in other words, the length and/or the width (diameter) of the housing is decreased), the same pressure as that before the volume is decreased can be maintained without elevating the charged pressure of the pressurized medium (&equals;the internal pressure of the housing). Incidentally, in the present invention, the weight ratio (X/Y) of the weight (X) of the pressurized medium and the weight (Y) of the gas generating agent is preferably 0.1 to 7, and more preferably 0.5 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, in the present invention, it is desirable that a pressure index, at a time of combustion of the gas generating agent, which is defined by the following formula: rb&equals;&agr;P<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>(in the formula, rb:burning rate, &agr;:coefficient, P:pressure, and n:pressure index), is less than 0.8. The pressure index (n) is more preferably 0.1 to 0.8, and further preferably 0.1 to 0.7. Incidentally, the pressure index n was obtained from two formulas of rb 1&equals;&agr;P1<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>and rb2&equals;&agr;P2<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>after measuring the burning rate rb1 in a tank having a pressure P1 (70 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) and measuring the burning rate rb2 in the tank having a pressure P2 (100 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the pressure index (n) is set to less than 0.8, since the burning rate in the initial stage of combustion of the gas generating agent is suppressed not to increase rapidly, the increase in an internal pressure of the housing is small. For this reason, even when the thickness of the housing is reduced, a sufficient pressure resistance can be maintained. Also, since the increase in an internal pressure of the housing is small (namely, a change of the internal pressure is small), the combustion of the gas generating agent is carried out stably, so that a combustion residue of the gas generating agent is not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By employing the method of reducing NOx according to the present invention, an amount of NOx generated by combustion of the gas generating agent can be reduced. Also, the reducing compound used in the NOx reducing method of the present invention is superior in thermal stability to the conventional art using a reducing compound different from the present invention, and hardly generates toxic gases. Accordingly, by employing the method of reducing NOx according to the present invention and also by using the hybrid inflator of the present invention, the reliability and safety of the inflator system can further be enhanced.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The reducing compound can be used in combination with a material (a reducing catalyst) functioning as a reducing catalyst. Examples of the materials as the reducing catalyst include copper oxide. An example of the combination of the reducing material and the reducing catalyst is the combination of 5-aminotetrazole and copper oxide. These compounds are preferably used as a mixture. When such a combination system is used as the reducing material, NOx is reduced by ammonia and amino radicals, etc. generated by the decomposition of 5-aminotetrazole, and is also reduced by the reaction between NOx and hydrogen, methane, etc, generated by the decomposition of 5-aminotetrazole. Therefore, the reducing effect can be enhanced synergistically, and the absolute amount of use of the reducing compound can be decreased. Furthermore, the ammonia concentration in the gas after the reduction can be prevented from becoming excessively high. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The composition ratio of the fuel and the oxidizing agent is not limited specifically. A known compounding ratio can be employed, for example, the oxidizing agent is preferably 10 to 80 parts by weight, and more preferably, 20 to 50 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The composition ratio of the fuel and the reducing compound is such that the reducing compound is preferably 0.1 to 30 parts by weight, more preferably, 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, and further preferably, 5 to 10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the fuel. When the content of the reducing compound is 0.1 parts by weight or more, the NOx reducing effect can be enhanced, and when the content is 30 parts by weight or less, combustion of the gas generating agent is not disturbed while maintaining an excellent NOx reducing effect. </paragraph>

An inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> was manufactured by using a high tensile strength steel (tensile strength: 90 kg/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As the pressurized medium, 2.6 moles (100 g) (internal pressure of 32,000 kPa) of a mixture gas of argon and helium &lsqb;Ar:He&equals;96:4 (mole ratio)&rsqb; was used. As the gas generating agent, 20 g thereof and 20 g thereof (the total amount of 40 g corresponds to the amount of gas generation of 1.0 mole) were used in the first gas generating chamber and in the second gas generating chamber (A/B&equals;7.2/2.8) respectively. The weight ratio (X/Y) of the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent was 2.5. Thereby, the gas of 3.6 moles was used in actuation, so that the total weight of the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent before actuation was 140 g. Incidentally, the pressure index (n) of this gas generating agent was 0.6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Also, in order to apply the NOx reducing effect, 3.5 g of reducing material (5-AT) in powder form shown in Table 1 was placed at a position <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A in Example 1, it was placed at a position <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B in Example 2, and it is placed at a position <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C in Example 3, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constituted in the above manner had a diameter of 59 mm, a length of 156 mm (which is a length except for the stud bolt <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, where the length of the stud bolt <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is 20 mm). The thickness of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> was 2.5 mm and the total weight thereof was about 1,200 g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A combustion test was conducted using the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and an NOx reducing effect was tested. Incidentally, the combustion test was conducted at room temperature by installing the hybrid inflator using the gas generating agent and 1g of an enhancer (reference numeral <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, B/KNO3) into a 2,800-liter tank. The test was carried out two times for each Example. The ignition of the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> was delayed till 30 msec after the ignition of the first igniter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Analysis of NOx or the like was conducted using a detector tube at 30 minutes after the start of the activation of the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.
