<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention proposes a method of managing the supply to a discharge lamp of a motor vehicle headlight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention also proposes a device for managing the supply to a discharge lamp of a motor vehicle headlight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A discharge lamp consists in particular of two electrodes. The emission of a light flux is due to the creation of an electric arc of light between the two electrodes. To do this, it is necessary to create a significant potential difference between the two electrodes which are arranged in a hermetic bulb, and which are separated from one another by a predetermined distance which may, for example, be 4 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The bulb is generally made of glass, particularly quartz glass, and is filled with a gas such as xenon at a high pressure, with metal salts and with halides in the solid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The electric arc struck in the xenon by the action of the switch-on command, supplies the energy needed to evaporate the metal salts and the halides, thus giving rise to the emission of a light flux. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The discharge lamp is supplied through a supply device also known as ballast which activates the lamp and thereafter allows it to operate in a stabilized state at an operating point that is determined by the characteristics of the lamp and the service that it is to provide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Activation of the lamp may be broken down into a striking phase and a phase of starting-up or warming-up the lamp during which the light flux emitted by the lamp increases until it reaches the predetermined operating point of the lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The striking phase is very short. It allows the electric arc to form between the two electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> During the start-up phase, as is known, the lamp is supplied with a first predetermined current which, in a predetermined length of time, allows the light flux emitted by the lamp to reach the predetermined light flux which corresponds to the operating point of the lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The start-up phase allows the electrodes, and other components of the lamp, such as the gas contained in the bulb, to heat up and reach their operating temperature, allowing the lamp optimum efficiency and optimum light flux. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, for the light flux of the lamp to reach 80% of the predetermined flux in two seconds, the lamp is supplied with a supply current of 2.6 amperes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> That makes it possible, when the user switches on his vehicle headlights, for the light flux provided by these quickly to be enough to satisfactorily illuminate the road. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the lamp is operating in a stabilized state, the supply current to the lamp is reduced to a value of the order of 0.4 ampere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, the first predetermined current imposed during the start-up phase causes accelerated ageing of the lamp and this is associated with the evaporation of the electrodes and with the mechanical stresses on the components of the lamp, these being due in particular to the sharp variation in temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In consequence, the life of the lamp is greatly reduced. Indeed, a discharge lamp equipping a vehicle, the headlights of which are switched on only by night, has a life of about 3000 hours, whereas the same bulb can achieve a longer life when the switch-on frequency is lower, for example when the headlights are switched on as soon as the vehicle is started, that is to say even by day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to minimize the ageing of the electrodes, the invention proposes a method of managing the supply to a discharge lamp of a motor vehicle headlight, characterized in that, during the phase of starting up the discharge lamp, the strength of the current supplied to the lamp is controlled on the basis of a parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle so as to optimize the life of the discharge lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to other features of the invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> the strength of the current and/or the power supplied to the lamp is limited to a value which is predetermined on the basis of the brightness outside the vehicle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> the parameter is representative of the future change in brightness outside the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention also proposes a device for managing the supply to a discharge lamp of a motor vehicle headlight, which comprises in particular a device for supplying the discharge lamp which controls the strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamp according to the method according to the process of the type described hereinabove, characterized in that it comprises a device for measuring the brightness outside the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to yet other features of the invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> the measurement device comprises an external-brightness sensor; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> the brightness sensor is designed to be arranged on the inside of a transparent wall, such as the windscreen of the vehicle or the headlight glass; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> the measurement device comprises a mapping system which provides the parameter representative of the vehicle environment on the basis of the location of the vehicle with respect to predetermined places such as a tunnel</paragraph>

<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from reading the detailed description which follows, for an understanding of which reference will made to the appended drawings in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically depicts a device for supplying a discharge lamp; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating the change in light flux emitted by a discharge lamp as a function of time for several strengths of current supplied to a discharge lamp; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically depicts a device for managing the supply to a discharge lamp which is achieved according to the invention.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As has been depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for supplying the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises, mounted in series, a converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for converting a DC voltage into another DC voltage, or DC/DC converter, a converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for converting DC voltage into AC voltage, or DC/AC converter, and a stage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for striking the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, all of which are controlled by an electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The DC/DC converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supplied with the vehicle battery voltage, or input voltage Ue, and comprises, for example, a transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The DC/AC converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises, for example, an H-bridge of four semiconductor switches (not depicted) which are controlled by the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A striking stage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> makes it possible in particular to produce a high voltage pulse during a phase known as the phase of striking the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which precedes the start-up phase also known as the warm-up phase, then a phase of operation in a stabilized state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The supply device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thus makes it possible for the discharge lamp to be supplied in such a way as to activate it, that is to say to set up the electric arc, then to increase the light flux emitted during the start-up phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> However, as described previously, the current supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the start-up phase is predetermined in such a way as to allow the light flux to increase up to the predetermined light flux that corresponds to the predetermined operating point of the lamp during a first predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> During the start-up phase, the supply device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls the power supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a maximum of 75 watts and manages the transition to the phase of operation in a stabilized state at 35 watts. During this phase, the image of the current strength is the most significant value in managing the power supplied to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For this reason, in what follows of the description, only the value of the current strength will be expounded upon, in the knowledge that power is linked directly to it through a proportionality relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the remainder of the description, the values of current strength, and the times indicated, are given by way of example for a type of lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the regulation D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> type, under determined conditions of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to the curve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in the customary way, the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supplied with a current of a strength of the order of 2.6 amperes. This supply current allows a short start-up time, that is to say that the light flux emitted by the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches more than 80% of the predetermined light flux corresponding to the operating point of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a few seconds after activation of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such an activation time is satisfactory with respect to the standards currently in force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The value of 2.6 amperes corresponds to the maximum strength of supply current allowed by the standards currently in force for vehicles running on the public highway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Now, supplying a supply current with a strength of the order of 2.6 amperes for a few seconds gives rise to accelerated ageing of the electrodes and greatly reduces the life of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Each activation of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the equivalent of about 5 minutes of operation of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when it is in its phase of operation in a stabilized state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although under certain conditions it is necessary for the <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> light flux to increase swiftly to allow effective illumination, particularly by night, there are other situations in which the increase in light flux can be far more gentle, particularly when the headlights are switched on during the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> What happens in this case is that the function of the headlights is not to illuminate the road in order to allow the driver to see it properly, but to allow the vehicle to be seen from further away by the users of other vehicles. Thus, if the increase in light flux to reach the predetermined flux of the phase of operation in a stabilized state is long, that is to say lasts several tens of seconds, this will have practically no impact on safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order to minimize the ageing of the electrodes to optimize the life of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the invention proposes a method for managing the supply to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which controls the strength of the current and/or the power supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the basis of a parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle, during the start-up phase of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the vehicle is in an environment which requires a swift rise in the light flux supplied by the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the strength of the current supplied to the lamp is set to a predetermined maximum value which may be of the order of 2.6 amperes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the vehicle is moving through an environment which does not dictate a swift rise in light flux, the power supplied to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or the strength of its supply current are set to other predetermined values which may be of the order of a few tenths of an ampere in the case of the current strength, and about 40 watts in the case of the maximum power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts two other examples of the change in light flux for two different strengths of supply current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Curve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is obtained with a current strength of 0.9 ampere supplied to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the flux emitted by the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches 100% of the predetermined flux after a time of the order of 20 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Curve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is obtained with a current strength of 0.6 ampere supplied to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the flux emitted by the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches 100% of the predetermined flux after a time of the order of 30 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Thus, when activating the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the curve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the ageing of the electrodes and the mechanical fatigue of the components of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are greatly reduced by comparison with the ageing experienced when the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>activated according to the curve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Each time the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is activated according to the curve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the life of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is extended by several minutes by comparison with the state of the art in which the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is always activated according to the curve I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, to each value of the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle, there corresponds a predetermined strength of supply current and a maximum power which make it possible to reach a compromise between the rate of increase of the intensity of the light flux and the acceleration of the ageing of the electrodes according to the environment of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The life of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thus greatly increased. In very specific cases which occur rarely, the invention allows an even more rapid increase in the light flux emitted than when the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supplied with a current of 2.6 amperes. This relates in particular to passing through a tunnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> What happens in this case is that the vehicle moves very quickly from a situation in which starting up the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be slow to a situation in which start up needs to be quick. In addition, the vehicle is then likely to travel at a high speed which requires perfect view of the road. Now, the start-up time represented by the curve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may prove to be too long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention allows the strength of the supply current to be set to a value higher than 2.6 amperes in order to reduce the start-up time. However, the strength of the supply current must not exceed a predetermined value which would cause total deterioration of the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The reduction in the life of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for start-up of this type is greater than the reduction in the life for a start-up with a current of 2.6 amperes. However, the overall life of the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is practically unaffected, this type of situation being very rare by comparison with the total number of start-ups of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during its life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Start-up of this type thus makes it possible to improve driving comfort, and safety, without significantly reducing the overall life of the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Of course, the standards currently in force restrict the value of the strength of the supply current of vehicles running on the public highway to 2.6 amperes. At the present time, vehicles which do not run on the public highway, such as site plant and forestry vehicles may be allowed to exceed this value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It must be remembered that the invention proposes, in particular cases, to reduce the life of the lamps slightly in order to allow an increase in driving comfort and user safety. For that, the strength of the supply current may temporarily exceed the strength of the current supplied to the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during activation under a common situation, such as activation by night when starting the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle may be representative of the brightness outside the vehicle. In this case, the value of the parameter may be proportional to the external brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, if the driver switches on the headlights of his vehicle while he is driving at nightfall, the value of the parameter representing the external brightness has a medium value. The strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be set to a medium value which may, for example, be 0.9 ampere. In this case, the light flux emitted by the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> increases in such a way as to reach the predetermined flux value in an average length of time which may be of the order of some twenty seconds, in accordance with the curve I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If the driver switches on the headlights of the vehicle when night has fallen, the light flux emitted by the lamp needs to increase rapidly so as to reach the predetermined flux value in a shorter length of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To do this, the method of managing the supply to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sets the strength of the supply current to a value higher than the previous one and which may, for example, be 2.6 amperes. In this case, the flux emitted by the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches the predetermined flux value in a short time which may be of the order of 2 to 3 seconds, in accordance with curve <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when the driver switches on the headlights of the vehicle during the day, the method of managing the supply sets the strength of the current supplied to the lamp to a value which may be of the order of several tenths of an ampere. In this case, the light flux may take several tens of seconds to reach the predetermined flux. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The parameter representative of the environment may also be representative of the future change in brightness outside the vehicle. In this case, the representative parameter makes it possible to anticipate the change in brightness outside so as to optimize the life of the discharge lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Anticipating the change in external brightness is highly advantageous in the event of a sharp variation in external brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For example, when the vehicle enters a tunnel, the brightness outside the vehicle drops very sharply. If the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the vehicle headlights are switched on before the tunnel is entered, the brightness outside the vehicle is high which means that, if the parameter taken into consideration for controlling the strength of the supply current does not anticipate the change in external brightness, the management method will set the strength of the current supplied to the lamp to a low value which may be of the order of several tenths of an ampere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As the vehicle enters the tunnel, if the driver has not had his headlights switched on for several tens of seconds, the intensity of the light flux emitted by the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will not be high enough to illuminate the road satisfactorily. That may increase the risk of an accident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the parameter representative of the environment is representative of the future change in brightness outside the vehicle, it makes it possible to predict the presence of the tunnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In consequence, the strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be controlled not on the basis of the brightness outside the vehicle when the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is switched on, but rather on the basis of the presence of the tunnel. Thus, although the brightness outside the vehicle is high, the strength of the current supplied to the lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be set to a value which will advantageously be determined on the basis of the distance between the vehicle and the tunnel, and the speed of the vehicle, that is to say on the basis of the predicted time between switching the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on and the vehicle entering the tunnel. If this time is of the order of several tens of seconds, the current strength may be 0.6 ampere. If this time is of the order of several seconds, the current may be 2.6 amperes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the method can also control the strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the basis of the temperature of its electrodes. Specifically, it is known that the rate of increase of light flux depends on the strength of the supply current and also on the temperature of the electrodes. The closer the electrode temperature is to the operating temperature, the lower the supply current may be for a constant rate of increase of light flux. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The electrode temperature may be estimated, for example on the basis of the strength of the current taken to start up the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> To simplify the management of the supply, particularly of the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the control of the strength of the supply current may consist in limiting the current strength to a value predetermined on the basis of the parameter representative of the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the headlights of a motor vehicle on the basis of a parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle may be controlled continuously. That is to say that to each value of the representative parameter there corresponds a value of supply current strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative, the strength of the current supplied to the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be controlled in stages. In this case, the range of variation of the value of the parameter is split into several stages. To each stage there corresponds a value of the supply current strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For example, it is possible to determine three stages of values for the parameter which correspond to the brightness during the day, at nightfall and during the night, respectively. To each of these stages there corresponds a strength of supply current. In this example, the three supply current strengths may correspond to 0.6, 0.9 and 2.6 amperes respectively, in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The invention also proposes a device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for managing the supply to the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which device is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The management device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for supplying the discharge lamp <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which device is connected to a measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via a control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> supplies a parameter which is representative of the environment of the vehicle. The parameter is supplied by the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the form of an electric signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows the electric signal to be processed so as to supply the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a command C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The management device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can operate in manual mode or automatic mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In manual mode, it is the driver of the vehicle who determines the time when the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the vehicle headlights will be switched on. The switching-on of the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is generally obtained by actuating a control lever <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> situated near the vehicle steering wheel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. When the driver switches the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on, the command C is supplied to the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to set the strength of the supply current and/or the maximum power supplied to the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to optimize their life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In an alternative, the switching-on of the lamps may be obtained by a voice-recognition device operated by the voice of the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In automatic mode, no driver intervention is needed to determine the time when the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be switched on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When the value of the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle reaches a predetermined threshold value which corresponds to a brightness outside the vehicle that entails illuminating the road using the headlights, the control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> supplies the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the command C to set the strength of the current supplied to the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or their power to optimize their life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It is possible to anticipate that, when the management device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is operating in automatic mode, manual determination on the part of the driver of the time at which to switch the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on takes priority. That allows the driver to anticipate the switching-on of the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to take into consideration certain information regarding the environment of the vehicle which is not taken into consideration by the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For example, when the parameter representative of the change in brightness outside the vehicle does not take account of the future change in this brightness, the driver of the vehicle can anticipate switching on the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when approaching the entrance to a tunnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Selection between manual and automatic operating modes can be made by actuation of a &ldquo;manual/automatic&rdquo; rotary switch (not depicted) by the driver of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise an external-brightness sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The brightness sensor may be arranged on the inside of the windscreen of the vehicle or of the glass of a headlight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Certain vehicles are equipped with a rain sensor which sets off and/or controls the wiping speed of a wiper device according to the intensity of the rain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In order to limit the cost of the management device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it is possible to couple the brightness sensor to such a rain detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise a clock which provides the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle on the basis of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> For example, the clock is programmed to make a parameter representative of the brightness outside the vehicle correspond to each time of the year for a given region or given country. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thus, depending on the time at which the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are switched on, the clock makes it possible to determine the brightness outside the vehicle so as to supply the control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> For example, in France, when the driver switches the headlights <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on at midnight on December 24, the parameter supplied by the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is representative of a very low light level. The clock actually makes it possible to determine that, at that moment, it is night-time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When the management device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is operating in automatic mode, the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which comprises a clock may make it possible to determine the time at which the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are switched on. Depending on the day of the year, and on the global position of the vehicle, the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> makes it possible to determine the moment at which the brightness outside is no longer sufficient and requires the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be switched on to illuminate the road and/or be correctly seen by the drivers of other vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The user of the vehicle may need lighting even though the timing corresponds to a daytime period; this is the case in particular when he is in a covered car park. In this eventuality, manual switching-on of the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the vehicle must take priority over the switching-on of the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in automatic mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also comprise a mapping system which supplies the parameter representative of the environment of the vehicle on the basis of the location of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The mapping system may, through various means, allow the position of the vehicle on the road network to be pinpointed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Such a measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is advantageously used for countries in which having the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the headlights switched on during the daytime is not compulsory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As the vehicle is driving along, it may pass through regions in which the brightness is far lower than the brightness outside, which involve illuminating the road using the vehicle headlights. This is particular the case with tunnels. In this case, it is advantageous to predict the presence of such regions so as to adapt the control of the strength of the current supplied to the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In automatic mode, the measurement device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which comprises a mapping system makes it possible in particular to anticipate the switching-on of the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the basis of the speed of the vehicle and its location with respect to the tunnels so that when the vehicle enters a tunnel, the intensity of the light flux emitted by the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sufficient. Anticipating switching on the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in particular makes it possible to set the strength of the current supplied to the lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a low value so as to limit the ageing of the electrodes and to optimize the life of the discharge lamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
