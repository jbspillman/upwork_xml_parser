<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Tires are typically prepared of treads of elastomer based rubber compositions which are conventionally carbon black reinforced. Sometimes tire tread rubber compositions may also be reinforced with silica by utilizing a combination of individual silica and carbon black particles. Typically the silica is a precipitated silica. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Often coupling agents are used with precipitated silica to assist in its reinforcement of elastomers with which the silica is mixed. Utilization of silica couplers for such purpose is well known to those skilled in such art, Historically, treated carbon black, particularly silicon treated carbon black, has been suggested for use as reinforcement of various diene-based elastomer compositions for tire treads. Historically, such treated carbon black has been a carbon black co-fumed with silica to create a carbon black composite which contains silica domains primarily on the surface of the carbon black. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,172,137, 6,160,047, 6,090,880 and 6,028,137. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the description of this invention, the terms &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; and &ldquo;elastomer&rdquo; if used herein, may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms &ldquo;rubber composition&rdquo;, &ldquo;compounded rubber&rdquo; and &ldquo;rubber compound&rdquo;, if used herein, are used interchangeably to refer to &ldquo;rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials&rdquo; and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber compounding art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY AND PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, a tire is provided having a circumferential tread of a rubber composition which comprises, based upon parts by weight per 100 parts by weight rubber (phr): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (A) from about 70 to about 95 phr of cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber and, correspondingly from about 5 to about 30 phr of cis 1,4-polybutadiene, wherein said elastomers are exclusive of functionalized elastomers and are exclusive of coupled elastomers; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (B) about 30 to about 110, alternatively about 30 to about 90, phr of reinforcing filler composed of a carbon black/silica composite comprised of carbon black which contains silicon-containing domains primarily on its surface, wherein said domains are comprised of silica, wherein said domains comprise at least 10 weight percent of said carbon black/silica composite, wherein at least 50, and in a range of about 50 to about 65, percent of the surface of said carbon black is covered by said domains and wherein said silica on the surface of said carbon black contain hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on their surfaces; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (C) a coupling agent as bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide which contains an average of from 2 to 2.6 sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge, wherein said coupling agent is exclusive of bis(3-alkoxysilylalkyl) polysulfide having an average of greater than 2.6, and particularly an average of greater than 3.5, sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> wherein said rubber composition contains from zero to a maximum of 15 phr of carbon black (untreated carbon black); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> wherein said rubber composition contains from zero to a maximum of 10, preferably zero, phr of precipitated silica and is exclusive of all other silicas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The carbon black/silica composite for use in this invention may be prepared by </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (A) co-fuming carbon black with silicon-containing material, (e.g. silica) at an elevated temperature in a manner to provide a composite of carbon black with integral discrete silicon-containing material (e.g. silica) entities, or domains, primarily on the outer surface of the carbon or by </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (B) co-precipitating carbon black and silica such as, for example, from a dispersion of carbon black in sodium silicate, to provide integral silica entities, or domains, on the outer surface of the carbon black. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In practice, it is considered herein that it is required that at least 50 percent of the surface of said carbon black is covered by said silica domains in order that sufficient hydroxyl groups are made available to react with the ethoxy groups of the specified coupling agent to more effectively couple the carton black/silica composite to the elastomers of the rubber composition. It is also required that maximum of about 65 percent of the carbon black surface is so-covered in order that at least about 35 percent of the carbon black surface remains available to act as a conventional carbon black reinforcement for the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In practice, the carbon black/silica composite used in this invention is exclusive of functionalized carbon blacks, other than the aforesaid inherently present hydroxyl groups associated with the silica domains on the surface of the carbon black. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In practice, the tread rubber composition is exclusive of any functionalized, silica other than said carbon black/silica composite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the carbon black/silica composite is prepared by co-fuming carbon black and a silicon-containing material (e.g. silica) together in order that the silica domains are integral with the surface of the carbon black to form a significant attachment for the hydroxyl groups of the silica and thereby enhance its coupling ability between the carbon black/silica composite and elastomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the silica entities, or domains, on the surface of the carbon black of the carbon black composite are integral with the carbon black in a sense of being an actual part of the carbon black composite as compared to simple mixtures of carbon black and silica. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the silica domains on the carbon black surface contain hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on the surface thereof Such hydroxyl groups are intended to be conventionally reactive with the aforesaid coupling agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Significantly, the silica coupler is required to be a bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide which contains an average of only 2 to 2.6 sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge. This is intended to exclude such organosilane polysulfides which contains an average greater than 2.6 sulfur atoms in their polysulfidic bridge such as, for example tetrasulfides commercially available as Si69, a trademark of Degussa GmbH which is understood to have an average of from about 3.5 to about 4 connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This is because with the more limited connecting sulfur atoms (a maximum average of 2.6 connecting sulfur atoms) in the coupling agent required by this invention, the bonds between the sulfur are relatively stronger and therefore having a far less tendency to form, or release, free sulfur in the rubber mixture as it is being processed at elevated temperatures as compared to similar organosilane polysulfides which contain an average of at least 3.5 connecting sulfur atoms in their polysulfidic bridges. The excess free sulfur is unwanted herein as it may tend to prematurely interact with double bonds contained in the diene elastomers, namely the said cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber and cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber during the mixing process and therefore to unnecessarily, and inappropriately prematurely increase the viscosity of the rubber composition during the mixing process and is considered herein to impair an efficient mixing and creation of a good dispersion of the carbon black/silica reinforcing filler within the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the practice of this invention, the tread rubber composition is desired to be limited to cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber with a minor amount of cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber because the primary intended use for the tire is a truck tire where it is desired that the rubber composition has a desired combination of resistance to tear, ultimate tensile strength and ultimate elongation. It is considered herein that the natural rubber contributes to the tear strength and the polybutadiene contributes to abrasion resistance and low hysteresis (100&deg; C. rebound) thereby promoting low heat build up during working conditions for the tire tread. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In particular, a combination of the following properties are required for the tire tread rubber composition of this invention as illustrated in the following Table A.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is also preferred that the rubber composition have a peel adhesion (95&deg; C.) of at least 34 N/mm. Peel adhesion is a measure of tear strength value for Sample A. Such test is conducted for peel adhesion of the Sample to itself. A description of such peel adhesion test may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,921 and ASTM D4393 test (except that a sample width of 1.3 cm is used and a clear Mylar plastic window of a 5 mm width is inserted in the test sample used). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The tread rubber composition itself can also be provided as being a sulfur cured composition through vulcanization of the uncured tread as a component of the tire itself in a manner well known to those having skill in such art, usually by curing under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure for a suitable period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The curatives for sulfur curing the rubber composition are curatives conventionally used for sulfur curable elastomers which typically include sulfur and one or more appropriate cure accelerators and sometimes also a retarder. Such curatives and use thereof for sulfur curable elastomer compositions are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Sequential mixing processes for preparing sulfur curable rubber compositions in which elastomers and associated ingredients exclusive of curatives are first mixed in one or more sequential steps, usually called a &ldquo;non-productive mixing step(s)&rdquo; followed by a final mixing step for adding curatives, usually called a &ldquo;productive mixing step&rdquo;, are also well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the coupling agent, if in a liquid form, might be used in conjunction with a carbon black carrier, namely, pre-mixed with a carbon black prior to the addition to the rubber composition, and such carbon black is usually to be included in the amount of carbon black accounted for in the rubber composition formulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, curing aids, such as sulfur, activators, retarders and accelerators, processing additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins, silicas, and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents and reinforcing materials such as, for example, carbon black. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the preparation of the rubber composition typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise about 0.5 to about 10 phr, usually about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise about 1 to about 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, napthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others such as, for example, those disclosed in <highlight><italic>The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook </italic></highlight>(1978), Pages 344 through 346. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise about 1 to 5 phr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid or mixtures of one or more fatty acids, can comprise about 0.5 to about 5 phr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Often stearic acid is used in a relatively impure state and is commonly referred to in the rubber compounding practice as &ldquo;stearic acid&rdquo; and is so referred to in the description and practice of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers, if used, comprise about 0.1 to about 1 phr. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The vulcanization is conducted in the presence of a sulfur vulcanizing agent. Examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include elemental sulfur (free sulfur) or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide or sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. As known to those skilled in the art, sulfur vulcanizing agents are used in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 4 phr, or even, in some circumstances, up to about 8 phr, with a range of from about 1 to about 2.5, sometimes from about 1 to about 2, being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary accelerator. Conventionally and preferably, a primary accelerator(s) is used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 2, phr. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in amounts of about 0.05 to about 3 phr in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The presence and relative amounts of the above ingredients, other than the carbon black/silica composite and specified coupling agent are not considered to be the primary subject of this invention which is more primarily directed to the use of the aforesaid carbon black/silica composite, and associated specified coupling agent for the reinforcement of tire tread rubber composition comprised of cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber and cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely, at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives are typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the &ldquo;productive&rdquo; mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The rubber, carbon black and coupling agent if used, are mixed in one or more non-productive mix stages. The terms &ldquo;non-productive&rdquo; and &ldquo;productive&rdquo; mix stages are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In at least one of the non-productive (NP) mixing stages, the materials are thermomechanically mixed and the mixing temperature is allowed to reach a temperature of, for example, between about 120&deg; C. and about 180&deg; C., usually from about 150&deg; C. to about 175&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As hereinbefore discussed the rubber composition of this invention is used for tire treads, particularly truck tire treads, designed to be used under relatively heavy working conditions on and off of paved roadways where heat build up and cut and chip resistance are important considerations. Such tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The invention may be better understood by reference to the following examples in which the parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A rubber composition composed of cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber and cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber was prepared and identified herein as Sample A. </paragraph>
