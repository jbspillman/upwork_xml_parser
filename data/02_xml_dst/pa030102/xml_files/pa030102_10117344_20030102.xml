<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A Compatibility Maturity Model assessment methodology (HIPAA-CMM) for evaluating compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;). The model is based on a proven and recognized CMM framework developed initially for measuring the quality and maturity level of an organization&apos;s software development processes and that has been extended to Systems Engineering and Systems Security Engineering. Unlike existing CMMs, HIPAA-CMM achieves the granularity and coverage necessary to provide a formal, repeatable, and consistent methodology to assess an organization&apos;s HIPAA compliance. This approach identifies areas of strong and marginal compliance, as well as those areas which are not in compliance with HIPAA, and provides a consistent basis for defining remediation means. Inherently, the HIPAA-CMM also serves as a tool for implementing continuous improvement and evaluating the effectiveness of the improvement measures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of process improvements, and specifically provides a method through which information security processes may be evaluated and improved. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The basic premise of process improvement is that the quality of goods and services produced is a direct function of the quality of the associated development and maintenance processes. The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has developed an approach to process improvement called the IDEAL model, which is described in the document entitled &ldquo;Systems Engineering Compatibility Model, Version 1.0&rdquo;, published by SEI and available via the Internet at http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/94.reports/pdf/hb04.94.pdf, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. IDEAL stands for Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Acting and Learning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The goal of the IDEAL model is to establish a continuous cycle of evaluating an organization&apos;s current processes, making improvements, and repeating this process. The high level steps are described below and are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> I Initiating Laying the groundwork for a successful improvement effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> D Diagnosing Determining where you are relative to where you want to be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> E Establishing Planning the specifics of how you will reach your destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A Acting Doing the work according to the plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> L Learning Learning from the experience and improving your ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Each of the five phases of the IDEAL approach is made up of several activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The Initiating Phase&mdash;Embarking upon a security engineering process improvement effort should be handled in the same manner in which all new projects within an organization are approached. One must become familiar with the project&apos;s objectives and means for their accomplishment, develop a business case for the implementation, gain the approval and confidence of management, and develop a method for the project&apos;s implementation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Effective and continuous support of the process improvement effort throughout its lifetime is essential for successful process improvement. Such support, or &ldquo;sponsorship&rdquo;, involves not only making available the financial resources necessary to continue the process but also personal attention from management to the project. After the relationship between the proposed effort and business goals has been established and key sponsors have given their commitment, a mechanism for the project&apos;s implementation must be established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The Diagnosing Phase&mdash;To perform process development/improvement activities, it is imperative that an understanding of an organization&apos;s current and desired future state of process maturity be established. These parameters form the basis of the organization&apos;s process improvement action plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Performing a gap analysis emphasizes the differences between the current and desired states of an organization&apos;s processes and reveals additional information or findings about an organization. Grouped according to area of interest, these findings form the basis of recommendations for how to improve an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The Establishing Phase&mdash;In this phase a detailed plan of action based on the goals of the effort and the recommendations developed during the Diagnosing Phase is created. In addition, the plan must take into consideration any possible constraints, such as resource limitations, which might limit the scope of the improvement effort. Priorities, along with specific outputs and responsibilities, are also put forth in the plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Time constraints, available resources, organizational priorities, and other factors may not allow for all of the goals to be realized or recommendations to be implemented during a single instance of the process improvement lifecycle. Therefore, the organization must establish priorities for its improvement effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As a result of the organization characterization defined in the Diagnosing Phase and priorities associated therewith, the scope of the process improvement effort may be different from that developed in the Initiating Phase. The Establishing Phase requires that any redefined objectives and recommendations be mapped to potential strategies for accomplishing desired outcomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> At this point, all of the data, approaches, recommendations, and priorities are brought together in the form of a detailed action plan. Included in the plan are the allocation of responsibilities, resources, specific tasks, and tracking tools to be used, as well as any deadlines and milestones. The plan should also include contingency plans and coping strategies for any unforeseen problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The Acting Phase&mdash;This is the implementation phase and requires the greatest level of effort of all the phases both in terms of resources and time. Achieving the organization&apos;s goals may require multiple parallel cycles within the Acting Phase to address all desired improvements and priorities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Solutions, or improvement steps, for each problem area are developed based on available information on the issue and resources for implementation. At this stage, the solutions are &lsquo;best guess&rsquo; efforts of a technical working group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first step in designing processes that will meet the business needs of an enterprise is to understand the business, product, and organizational context that will be present when the process is being implemented. Some questions that need to be answered before process design include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> How is security engineering practiced within the organization&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> What life cycle will be used as a framework for this process&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> How is the organization structured to support projects&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> How are support functions handled (e.g., by the project or the organization)&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> What are the management and practitioner roles used in this organization&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> How critical are these processes to organizational success&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because first attempts at generating solutions rarely succeed, all solutions must be tested before they are implemented across an organization. How an organization chooses to test its solutions is dependent upon the nature of the area of interest, the proposed solution, and the resources of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Using information collected during testing, potential solutions should be modified to reflect new knowledge about the solution. The importance of the processes under focus as well as the complexity of the proposed improvements will dictate the degree of testing and refinement proposed solutions must undergo before being considered acceptable for implementation throughout an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once a proposed improved process has been accepted it must be implemented beyond the test group. Depending upon the nature and degree to which a process is being improved, the implementation stage may require significant time and resources. Implementation may occur in a variety of ways depending upon the organization&apos;s goals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The Learning Phase&mdash;The Learning Phase is both the final stage of the initial process improvement cycle and the initial phase of the next process improvement effort. Here the entire process improvement effort is evaluated in terms of goal realization and how future improvements can be instituted more efficiently. This phase is only as constructive as the detail of records kept throughout the process and the ability of participants to make recommendations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Determining the success of process improvement requires analyzing the final results in light of established goals and objectives. It also requires evaluating the efficiency of the effort and determining where further enhancements to the process are required. These lessons learned are then collected, summarized and documented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Based on an analysis of the improvement effort itself, the lessons learned are translated into recommendations for subsequent improvement efforts. These recommendations should be promulgated outside those guiding the improvement effort for incorporation in this and other improvement efforts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the IDEAL method, the following basic principles of process change are necessary to implement a successful process improvement activity: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Sponsorship of major changes by Senior Management </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Focusing on fixing the process, not assigning the blame </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Understanding current processes first </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Realizing that change is continuous </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Accepting that improvement requires investment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Retaining improvement requires periodic reinforcement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In 1986, in collaboration with Mitre Corporation, the SEI developed a methodology for measuring the maturity of software development processes. This methodology was formalized into the creation of Capability Maturity Models (CMM) of Software. Although originally designed for the analysis and improvement of software and software development processes, the CMM methodology can be used to analyze almost any process. A CMM generally describes the stages through which development processes progress as they are defined, implemented and improved. In addition, a CMM defines a process&apos;s capability as the quantifiable range of expected results that can be achieved by following a process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Because of its flexibility, the CMM methodology has been applied to many environments as the framework for implementing process improvements. For example, the &ldquo;Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model SSE-CMM Model Description Document Version 2.0&rdquo;, published Apr. 1, 1999 by the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) Project and available via the Internet at http://www.sse-cmm.org, referred to herein as simply SSE-CMM, applies the CMM methodology to systems security engineering, and the teachings thereof are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In the SSE-CMM, the authors state: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;The model provides a guide for selecting process improvement strategies by determining the current capabilities of specific processes and identifying the issues most critical to quality and process improvement within a particular domain. A CMM may take the form of a reference model to be used as a guide for developing and improving a mature and defined process.&rdquo;

It also provides a reference to compare existing systems engineering practices against essential systems engineering elements described in the model. SE-CMM is based on systems engineering definitions in which scientific and engineering efforts are selectively applied to: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the SE-CMM defines a system as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> an integrated composite of people, products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a need or objective; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> an assembly of things or parts forming a complex or unitary whole; a collection of components organized to accomplish a specific function or set of functions; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> an interacting combination of elements, viewed in relation to function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> SSE-CMM takes a process-based approach to information systems security and is based on SE-CMM. SE-CMM methodology and metrics are duplicated in SSE-CMM in that SSE-CMM provides a reference to compare existing systems security engineering best practices against essential systems security engineering elements described in the model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> SSE-CMM defines two dimensions that are used to measure the ability of an organization to perform specific activities: domain and capability. The domain dimension consists of all practices that collectively define security engineering. These practices are referred to as &ldquo;base practices&rdquo; (BPs). The capability dimension represents practices that indicate process management and institutionalization capability. These practices are called &ldquo;generic practices&rdquo; (GPs) as they apply across a wide range of domains. GPs represent activities that should be performed as part of performing BPs. The relationship between BPs and GPs is given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which illustrates evaluation of resource allocations to support BPs of identifying system security vulnerabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For the domain dimension, SSE-CMM specifies eleven technical security engineering PAs and eleven organizational and project-related PAs, each comprised of BPs. BPs are mandatory characteristics that must exist within an implemented security engineering process before an organization can claim satisfaction in a given PA. The twenty-two PAs and their corresponding BPs incorporate systems security engineering best practices. The PAs are: </paragraph>

These GPs apply to all PAs and serve to measure the capability of an organization to perform the PAs. The GPs are ordered in degrees of maturity and are grouped to form and distinguish among five levels of security engineering maturity. The attributes of these five levels are: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The corresponding general descriptions of the five levels are given as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Level 1, &ldquo;Performed Informally&rdquo;, focuses on whether an organization or project performs a process that incorporates the BPs. A statement characterizing this level would be &ldquo;you have to do it before you can manage it.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Level 2, &ldquo;Planned and Tracked&rdquo;, focuses on project-level definition, planning, and performance issues. A statement characterizing this level would be &ldquo;understand what&apos;s happening on the project before defining organization-wide processes.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Level 3, &ldquo;Well Defined&rdquo;, focuses on disciplined tailoring from defined processes at the organization level. A statement characterizing this level would be &ldquo;use the best of what you&apos;ve learned from your projects to create organization-wide processes.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Level 4, &ldquo;Quantitatively Controlled&rdquo;, focuses on measurements being tied to the business goals of the organization. Although it is essential to begin collecting and using basic project measures early, measurement and use of data is not expected organization-wide until the higher levels have been achieved. Statements characterizing this level would be &ldquo;you can&apos;t measure it until you know what &lsquo;it&rsquo; is&rdquo; and &ldquo;managing with measurement is only meaningful when you&apos;re measuring the right things.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Level 5, &ldquo;Continuously Improving&rdquo; gains leverage from all the management practice improvements seen in the earlier levels, then emphasizes the cultural shifts that will sustain the gains made. A statement characterizing this level would be &ldquo;a culture of continuous improvement requires a foundation of sound management practice, defined processes, and measurable goals.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The process evaluation techniques set forth above have been applied in the area of security software development for several years. However, Congress recently enacted legislation which has created a new avenue for applying these process evaluation techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The U.S. Kennedy-Kassabaum Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA-Public Law 104-191), effective date Aug. 21, 1996, addresses the issues of health care privacy and plan portability in the United States. With respect to privacy, the Act states &ldquo;Not later than the date that is 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit . . . detailed recommendations on standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information.&rdquo; The Act further states that &ldquo;the recommendations . . . shall address at least the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> 1. The rights that an individual who is a subject of individually identifiable health information should have. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 2. The procedures that should be established for the exercise of such rights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> 3. The uses and disclosures of such information that should be authorized or required.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The Act provides that if the legislation governing standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information is not enacted by &ldquo;the date that is 36 months after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall promulgate final regulations containing such standards not later than the date that is 42 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.&rdquo; Congress failed to act by that date and, therefore, the Secretary of Health and Human Services was required to issue privacy regulations no later than Feb. 21, 2000. This date was not met, but the regulations were announced in December of 2000 and included the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Coverage extends to medical records of all forms, not only those in electronic form. This coverage includes oral and paper communications that did not exist in electronic form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Patient consent is required for routine health record disclosures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Disclosure of full medical records is allowed for purposes of treatment to providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Unauthorized use of medical records for employment purposes is prohibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Final privacy regulations have been promulgated, however changes have been proposed thereto. In addition, the Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers standards associated therewith are still in draft form. However, the privacy regulations state the following in reference to information system security requirements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;c) (1) Standard: safeguards. A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> (2) Implementation specification: safeguards. A covered entity must reasonably safeguard protected health information from any intentional or unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of the standards, implementation specifications or other requirements of this subpart.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> At the present state of the regulations, HIPAA provides the following penalties for violations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> General penalty for failure to comply&mdash;each violation $100; maximum for all violations of an identical requirement may not exceed $25,000 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Wrongful disclosure of identifiable health information&mdash;$50,000, imprisonment of not more than one year, or both </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Wrongful disclosure of identifiable health information under false pretenses&mdash;$100,000, imprisonment of not more than five years, or both </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Offense with intent to sell information&mdash;$250,000, imprisonment of not more than ten years, or both </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Addressing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) health information standards in an effective manner requires a sound, structured approach. The method of compliance with HIPAA privacy regulations and pending Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers standards should provide proper and complete coverage of the requirements of the law and support metrics for evaluating implementation effectiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The major issue relative to meeting HIPAA information security requirements at this time is that there is no standard process in place to determine HIPAA compliance. This situation becomes more complicated when institutions are evaluated according to different criteria and methodologies. What is needed is a standard methodology and evaluation model that is based on proven, valid techniques that are recognized by the information security community. The present invention is a HIPAA-Capability Maturity Model (HIPAA-CMM) based on such techniques. The model is based on a proven and recognized CMM framework developed initially for measuring the quality and maturity level of an organization&apos;s software development processes and that has been extended to Systems Engineering and Systems Security Engineering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> While the Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers regulations have yet to be finalized and are subject to amendment, the privacy regulation already provides that &ldquo;&lsqb;a&rsqb; covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.&rdquo; A review of the current draft regulation on security standards reveals that it codifies information system security best practices that are generally accepted in the commercial government arenas. To comply with the Act and the privacy regulation&apos;s requirement for &ldquo;appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards,&rdquo; covered entities will have to demonstrate due diligence in implementing generally accepted information system security best practices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> HIPAA-CMM is a standard framework for evaluating and assuring HIPAA compliance. The Process Areas (PAs) selected for HIPAA-CMM are based on generally accepted best practices of systems security engineering. A PA is a defined set of related security engineering process characteristics which, when performed collectively, can achieve a defined purpose. Thus, HIPAA-CMM will not only measure compliance with current HIPAA requirements, but also with standards likely to be included in final Security Rules and Electronic Signatures and Identifiers regulations when issued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> HIPAA-CMM has its roots in the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM), however HIPAA-CMM represents an improvement over SSE-CMM. The SSE-CMM PAs incorporate technical, organizational, and project best practices of systems security engineering. As such, they provide a process-based common thread that encompasses most security-related evaluation criteria and security guidance documents. HIPAA-CMM incorporates a subset of the twenty-two SSE-CMM PAs to address HIPAA privacy and information security requirements by providing coverage and granularity as required by HIPAA regulations that are not addressed by the SSE-CMM. The present invention achieves these goals through development of additional PAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> These PAs are HIPAA-specific PAs (HPAs) and serve to customize the model for the HIPAA application. The HPAs are based on the final HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Transaction Code Set Standards. Although the Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers has not been promulgated as of the time of filing, corresponding requirements have been developed based on proposed rules and generally accepted best security practices. As a result, HIPAA-CMM is designed as a basis for providing full evaluation coverage necessary to address all HIPAA information security compliance requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> A catalyst for the present invention was an initial investigation of relationships between SSE-CMM and other federal information security compliance standards. Questions asked during this investigation included: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> 1. &ldquo;How can the SSE-CMM assist in supporting the use of federal security standards and guidelines&quest;&rdquo;; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> 2. &ldquo;How can the SSE-CMM be used to gather evidence of compliance&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the past, SSE-CMM PA mappings to federal security standards and guidelines have been shown to be feasible and valuable in providing evidence for evaluation of assurance mechanisms. In all such mappings, SSE-CMM is viewed as complementary to associated evaluation criteria and provides a structured basis for evidence gathering and assurance. However, HIPAA regulations require an enterprise view of an organization&apos;s privacy and security processes and procedures that is not implemented by Information Technology/Information Security (IT/IS) evaluation mechanisms or fully covered by SSE-CMM. Thus, there is a need for supplemental PAs to meet proposed HIPAA information security legislative requirements. These supplemental PAs and selected SSE-CMM PAs comprise HIPAA-CMM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> SSE-CMM mappings investigated as part of HIPAA-CMM development were those involved with Common Criteria Assurance Requirements, Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) and the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The mappings also apply to the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) because NIACAP is an extension of DITSCAP for non-defense Government organizations. NIACAP and DITSCAP were developed for independent evaluation of Government IT/IS and are very effective in performing that function. Also, a version of the NIACAP, the Commercial INFOSEC Analysis Process (CIAP) is under development for evaluation of critical commercial systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Other SSE-CMM mappings have been proposed, including to ISO/IEC 13335 Information Technology&mdash;Security Techniques Guidelines for the Management of IT Security (GMITS)&mdash;Part 2; the NIST Handbook; BS 7799; and the Canadian Handbook on Information Technology Security MG-9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The mapping of process-based mechanisms (SSE-CMM) to assurance-based mechanisms (Common Criteria, DITSCAP, TCSEC) has been addressed by Ferraiolo, et. al. in their December, 1997 paper entitled &ldquo;Final Report Contract Number 50-DKNB-7-90099, Process-Based Assurance Product Suite&rdquo; and their 1999 paper, entitled &ldquo;Building a Case for Assurance from Process&rdquo;, the teachings of both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Ferraiolo, et. al&apos;s analysis produced the following general conclusions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Although there is a significant overlap between SSE-CMM PAs and the assurance-based activities, there is not always a complete one-to-one mapping </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> SSE-CMM may not provide the level of granularity required to directly address all specific assurance requirements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> SSE-CMM can be used to develop assurance arguments and product assurance evidence if applied with appropriate guidance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the PAs of the SSE-CMM correspond well with traditional assurance processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The processes defined in the SSE-CMM are considered to contribute to the development of assurance arguments by integrators, product developers, evaluators and manufacturers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> With the appropriate guidance, tailoring and evidence gathering, it was demonstrated that the results of an SSE-CMM assessment could support important aspects of traditional assurance-based mechanisms </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The SSE-CMM can be viewed as a common thread that logically links traditional assurance methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In a similar vein, Hopkinson has proposed mappings to ISO/IEC 13335 Information Technology&mdash;Security Techniques -Guidelines for the Management of IT Security (GMITS)&mdash;Part 2; the NIST Handbook; BS 7799; and the Canadian Handbook on Information Technology Security MG-9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the referenced mappings and HIPAA mappings developed as part of the present invention, SSE-CMM is complementary to associated evaluation criteria and provides a structured basis for evidence gathering and assurance. However, for specific assurance areas in HIPAA requiring more granularity than provided by the SSE-CMM, additional BPs must be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As stated in Ferraiolo, et. al.&apos;s 1999 article, &ldquo;For the evaluators and certifiers, the SSE-CMM can provide direct evidence regarding process claims, as well as a uniform method to evaluate claims and evidence, thus contributing to the normalization of the evaluation/certification process-making the process more defined and repeatable and less intuitive. Ultimately, this direct benefit can be measured in terms of cost/schedule savings to evaluation and certification efforts.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Therefore, HIPA-CMM was designed to provide assurance-based security mechanisms such as those required by HIPAA, including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Ensuring the appropriate processes corresponding to the required assurance mechanisms are in place </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Evidence gathering to support assurance claims </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Ensuring complete coverage of required regulations or standards </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Measuring the present information security posture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Evaluating effectiveness of remediation efforts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Ensuring repeatability of the appraisal process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Continuous improvement of the security processes </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The HIPAA-CMM uses the GPs, capability levels, and a major subset of the PAs of SSE-CMM to evaluate HIPAA information security compliance. Remediation of the areas of weakness or noncompliance can then be addressed with confidence in a cost-effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Ideally, there would be a one-to-one mapping of all HIPAA information security requirements to SSE-CMM PAs. There are, in fact, such mappings but these mappings do not complete HIPAA compliance coverage based on the present state of HIPAA regulations and corresponding generally accepted best information security practices. Obviously, where HIPAA requirements are process-oriented, there is a better mapping to SSE-CMM PAs. Other HIPAA privacy regulations require more granularity and coverage of information security issues than provided by SSE-CMM PAs. These additional requirements are met using HIPAA specific PAs (HPAs) as defined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In reviewing the HIPAA assurance requirements based on extant privacy regulations, the draft Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers, and corresponding best information security practices, the following PAs from the SSE-CMM were selected. These PAs address a subset of the HIPAA requirements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> To complete HIPAA compliance evaluation coverage, newly defined PAs tailored to the remaining HIPAA requirements are needed. These HIPAA Specific PAs, or HPAs, are developed and described below. The capability dimension of the SSE-CMM with its GPs will be used for the HIPAA-CMM model and its PAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a process by which complementary SSE-CMM and HPAs can be combined to develop a HIPAA-CMM and through which continuous process improvements can be implemented. Block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> represents evaluating and organizing HIPAA information security requirements. Block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> represent known SSE-CMM PAs. Block <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> represents HPAs as defined as part of the present invention or other, similar PAs. In Block <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, SSE-CMM PAs are mapped to specific HIPAA information security requirements. In Block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, HPAs are combined with the SSE-CMM PA to HIPAA information security mappings to ensure valid and complete coverage of all HIPAA information security requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In Block <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, HIPAA-CMM methods are employed to obtain information through which the maturity of the associated information security processes can be evaluated and the effectiveness of the processes can be assured. In Block <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, process maturity measures and HIPAA compliance requirement effectiveness are developed. In Block <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, corrections for any deficiencies identified in Block <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> from the data collected in Block <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are implemented. Once such corrections are implemented, the impact of those corrections is analyzed by returning to Block <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. This process repeats in a periodic, iterative fashion to continually analyze the information security processes for compliance with HIPAA regulations. In addition, as new HIPAA requirements are promulgated or as existing requirements are changed or omitted, the process may be repeated beginning with Block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The HPAs referenced above in conjunction with Block <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> are based on an analysis of HIPAA privacy regulations and the draft Security Rule, Electronic Signatures and Identifiers. The analysis revealed that the following five categories of HIPAA information security practice requirements could not be directly matched to SSE-CMM PAs: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Establishing and designating responsibility for ensuring that policies and procedures are followed relative to the release of individually identifiable patient healthcare information and establishing recourse for violations of these policies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Developing Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans for all relevant networks and systems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Establishing Patient Health Care Information protection, validation and authentication through logical controls and protecting the confidentiality and data integrity of exchanged information with external entities </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Establishing personnel information security policies and procedures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Addressing physical security requirements for information systems protection, including theft, fire and other hazards </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Therefore, to complete the required coverage of the HIPAA compliance requirements, five PAs with corresponding BPs are needed. These HPAs incorporate the generally accepted best security engineering practices and are focused on the five identified HIPAA categories that could not be met by PAs of the SSE-CMM. The goals of the HPAs map to the HIPAA requirements and the BPs provide guidance on the specific actions to take to confirm that the goals are accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> HPAs and related BPs implemented in the present invention include, but are not limited to: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Conducting an appraisal using the mappings defined in the tables provides the means to measure the quality of the processes in place to meet the HIPAA information security-related regulation requirements. To provide meaningful results, the question of &ldquo;What capability level ensures compliance&quest;&rdquo; has to be answered. The standard proposed in this approach is that for all the HIPAA-CMM PAs, the Level 2 GPs as defined in the SSE-CMM have to be achieved for minimum HIPAA information security-related compliance. For compliance to remain in place over the long term and be considered an element of continuous process improvement, the Level 3 GPs should be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> As noted in Block <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the appraisal results are used to implement continuous improvement of the information security processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> A HIPAA-CMM and assessment methodology are developed herein as a standard for evaluating HIPAA compliance. With appropriate guidance from and use of the SSE-CMM PAs and the additional granularity and coverage of the HPAs defined herein, the HIPAA-CMM provides a formal, repeatable and consistent methodology through which an organization&apos;s HIPAA compliance can be assessed. This approach will identify areas of strong compliance, marginal compliance and lack of compliance and provide a consistent basis for defining remediation means. Inherently, the HIPAA-CMM also serves as a tool for implementing continuous improvement and evaluating the effectiveness of the improvement measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment and various alternative embodiments of the invention have been disclosed and described in detail herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
