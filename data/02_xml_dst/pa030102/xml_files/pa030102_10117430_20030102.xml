<heading lvl="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Not Applicable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a desk or work surface wherein a computer keyboard platform is mounted under a front edge of the work surface and wherein a movable section of the front edge of the work surface is mounted on a track that permits the movable section to be moved downwardly and under the keyboard platform for storage or removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The use of a computer on a work surface presents some challenges. If a keyboard is simply rested on the top of a work surface, the work surface cannot be used as a writing surface. Also, proper keyboard elevation generally is somewhat lower than the preferred elevation of a writing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome these problems, there are numerous keyboard trays that are mounted on or below a work surface, wherein the keyboard tray can be extended outwardly to a use position, generally in front of the front edge of the work surface. Exemplary patents that disclose this type of a construction are U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,316,082, 4,145,097, 4,625,657, 5,653,413, and 5,772,292. Products of this nature usually place the keyboard in front of the desk surface when in its working position, thus placing the user somewhat further from the desk surface in order to use the keyboard. In most applications, the desks are provided with an open recess below the work surface so that the keyboard tray can slide directly outwardly from a recess under the front edge of the work surface. When the work surface has an apron or flange mounted on the underside of the front edge of the work surface, the construction necessary to have a pull-out keyboard tray mounted underneath and behind the apron is more complex, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,413. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another approach to keyboard storage is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,735,466, wherein a keyboard is positioned on a pop-up tray that elevates through an opening in the desk work surface when a cover panel is removed and slid rearwardly on the top of the desk surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an improved keyboard storage mechanism for a desk unit that is useful for both a conventional desk unit and for a corner desk. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a desk unit incorporating a concealed pull-out keyboard well comprises a work surface having an upper writing surface and a keyboard platform mounted under a work surface. A movable section of the work surface at a front edge thereof is removable from the work surface and movable in a path that extends downwardly and under the front edge of the keyboard tray and then rearwardly under the keyboard tray, where the movable section can be stored or removed from the desk unit. When the movable section is repositioned under the keyboard tray, the keyboard can be used or extended for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The desk construction of the present invention can be employed advantageously in a corer mounted desk, wherein the keyboard tray is mounted underneath an L-shaped or V-shaped corner in the desk at a 45&deg; angle with respect to the corner. Alternatively, the invention can be employed in a conventional desk having a straight front edge of the work surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention makes it possible to provide a pull-out keyboard tray in a desk unit having an apron that extends downwardly from the underside of the work surface adjacent the front edge.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, an L or V-shaped desk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, comprises a work surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and work surface supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that position the work surface at a working elevation. Work surface supports can comprise conventional pedestals, legs, or panels or the work surface support can be provided by a cantilevered support from a panel mechanism. The term desk is employed in the present application to refer to a work surface supported at a working elevation by any support mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Desk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of right angle sections <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are joined together at a 45&deg; angle so as to form an inside corner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> where the sections are joined. Corner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed in a front edge or front side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the work surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Desk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> incorporates a concealed keyboard well <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> mounted at a 45&deg; angle in front edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the work surface. Well <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a pair of spaced side members <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> attached to and extending downwardly from the underside of work surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of corner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with sides <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being positioned at a 45&deg; angle with respect to the linear direction of sections <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The keyboard platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is positioned below the work surface and slidably mounted by slide brackets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between side panels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The keyboard platform can be moved between a stored position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to a use position <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The keyboard platform is positioned at a desired elevation for keyboard operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The recessed keyboard platform is concealed from view by a well cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that includes a movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the work surface at the front edge of the work surface at corner <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted on tracks positioned on the inside surfaces of side members <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for movement between an extended position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to a retracted position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, when the well cover or removable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in its extended position, the movable section constitutes an uninterrupted portion of the writing surface of the work surface and is basically coplanar with the work surface. When moved to its retracted position, the movable section moves downwardly and rearwardly from its extended position to a stored position underneath the keyboard platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, well cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> not only includes movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the work surface but it also can include a downwardly extending apron or flange <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adjacent a front edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The apron is decorative (or it could be a drawer) and also serves to conceal the keyboard platform. Side panels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also extend downwardly from the sides of the well cover. Pins or projections <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend outwardly from the sides of panels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at spaced longitudinal locations on the panels. Pins <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> engage slots <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the inside surfaces of side members <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. While pins and slots provide an effective means for supporting and guiding the well cover between its extended and retracted positions, other types of track and follower mechanisms could be employed instead of a pin and slot configuration, and other movable support mechanisms can be employed for the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, track slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has an upwardly extending rear leg <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a forwardly extending segment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and then an arcuate portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extending upwardly and then rearwardly from a front end of segment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A distal end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extends slightly downwardly so that when pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is nested at the end of the arcuate section, the weight of the well cover will tend to maintain it in that position. Slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes an offset portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> adjacent a rear end thereof where the forwardly extending segment extends upwardly and then rearwardly immediately in front of rear leg <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes an upward leg <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that joins an intermediate leg <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that extends forwardly and then curves upwardly along an inclined path to a horizontally oriented upper section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Upper section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> terminates at end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> behind front apron <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, pins <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are spaced apart so that pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can ride in slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can ride in slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the well cover is in its extended position, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pins <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rest on downwardly and rearwardly extending distal end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, while pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rests on horizontal section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the slot. The slots thus provide vertical support for both the front and rear sides of the movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when the well cover is in its extended position. Movable section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coplanar with work surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thus serves as a portion of the work surface when in its extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring sequentially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the movement of the well cover in moving from its extended position to its retracted position is shown. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to initiate movement of the well cover toward its retracted position, the well cover is first pulled forwardly so that pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends to the forward end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of slot section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When this is done, pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> first moves upwardly away from end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and then follows a downward arcuate path along arcuate section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thus, the well cover moves forwardly and then tips rearwardly in its initial movement from its extended to its retracted position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the well cover is then pushed rearwardly where the pins continue to follow the slots. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is engaging the inclined portion of the intermediate leg of slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> while pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has reached the bottom of arcuate portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and has commenced horizontal movement along segment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rear edge of the cover has reached a position below keyboard platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while the front side of the well cover continues to drop downwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it can be seen that as the well cover traverses in a rearward direction, the entire well cover recedes to a position below the level of keyboard platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the path continues until the well cover is completely below keyboard platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. At this point, pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> engages offset portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in slot <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the offset portion stops the cover from further movement rearwardly. The well cover is thus in its retracted or stored position and is completely out of the way from the keyboard platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Keyboard platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can then be extended to the position of platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime;, as shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</cross-reference>. In this position, a keyboard <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (shown schematically in phantom) is positioned for convenient access at the corner of the desk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If it is desired to remove the well cover completely from the apparatus (for disassembly or for additional knee room), the rear end of the well cover can be lifted upwardly so that pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is lifted over the stop provided by offset portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Then, the pins can proceed rearwardly to downward legs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The well cover is then lowered out of the track formed by the slots and removed from the apparatus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Reinsertion of the well cover can be accomplished in a reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The keyboard platform desirably is extendable, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</cross-reference>. The keyboard platform can be mounted with conventional hardware on the inside surfaces of the side members that permits the keyboard platform to slide or roll on a horizontal track in a forward and rearward direction. The keyboard platform may have an upwardly extending rear panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a roller <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be mounted at the upper end of the rear panel in order to ride along the underside of the work surface so as to maintain the keyboard platform in a horizontal position and provide a non-friction rolling contact between the rear end of the keyboard platform and the underside of the work surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Photographs showing a V-shaped desk employing the concealed keyboard well of the present invention are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in various stages of movement. The keyboard well cover is in its extended position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, wherein the movable section of the work surface completely closes the opening in the work surface and conceals the well. The apron extending downwardly from the front portion of the movable section is compatible with the apron on an adjacent section of desk and conceals the keyboard platform underneath the work surface. The progression of movement of the well cover from its extended to its retracted position is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The movement of the keyboard platform between its stored and use positions is shown progressively in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is desirably employed in connection with a V-shaped desk wherein separate sections are mounted at a skewed angle to form a corner, the present invention can also be employed with a conventional desk having a straight front edge, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> desk <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a work surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and pedestal supports <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on each side of opening <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> between the pedestals. A keyboard well cover <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shown in its extended position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The well cover can be mounted on tracks positioned on side members at the sides of the well cover or on the inside surfaces of pedestals <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in the same manner as the V-shaped desk described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, well cover <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shown partially moved between its extended and retracted positions. A keyboard platform <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown mounted under work surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Side members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> formed where the well cover fits into the work surface include slots <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that engage pins in the sides of the cover in the manner described above. Because the cover fits under the keyboard platform, an apron <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the front edge of the cover can be used to conceal the keyboard platform and yet will not impede the movement of the keyboard platform to its use position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Photographs of modular furniture incorporating the present invention are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the concealed keyboard well can be incorporated into a corner desk unit of modular furniture employing any number of separate modular components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the foregoing is merely exemplary of the preferred practice of the present invention and that various changes and modifications may be made in the arrangements and details of construction of the embodiments disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
