The method comprises advising a short-range terminal (<highlight><bold>104, 109</bold></highlight>) of a change in the quality of a connection by the initiative of a short-range rf access point (<highlight><bold>101 </bold></highlight>to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). In the method, a short-range connection is established between said terminal (<highlight><bold>104, 109</bold></highlight>) and said access point (<highlight><bold>101 </bold></highlight>to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>), said access point (<highlight><bold>101 </bold></highlight>to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) monitors the level of the signal transmitted by said terminal (<highlight><bold>104, 109</bold></highlight>), said access point (<highlight><bold>101 </bold></highlight>to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) compares the strength of the radio-frequency signal transmitted by said terminal (<highlight><bold>104, 109</bold></highlight>) with a predetermined threshold value.

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the use of short-range radio frequency technology. Particularly, but not necessarily, the invention relates to guiding a user of a wireless terminal employing Bluetooth technology in determining a service area. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth technology is a new technology, which is employed in wireless communication and enables communication of mobile telephones, computers, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) devices or generally devices with an integrated Bluetooth circuit, by using a short-range wireless radio connection. Each device supporting the Bluetooth technology, i.e. a Bluetooth device, is provided with a Bluetooth transceiver. For example, it can be a microchip, an integrated circuit, which transmits and receives information, such as speech or data, wirelessly within a frequency range of about 2.4 GHz. Currently, the range of a Bluetooth connection is about 10 meters, when normal transmission power is used. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Short-range radio devices allow creation of various systems and services in offices, shopping malls or public premises, for instance, by utilizing access points. The services thus operate only in the vicinity of the access point, typically within the range of only about 10 meters. Hence, a problem arises that the service area of this kind of service is not apparent to a user. Thus, the service user is not aware of being on the fringe of the service area, unless he or she is not informed about it in one way or another, and consequently the connection may be suddenly disconnected. The user should therefore be aware of the changes in his/her connection so as to be able to choose whether to stay in the Bluetooth Access Point (BAP) area or to release the current connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,373,548 discloses a prior art solution that provides an out-of-range warning. The operational environment is a cordless telephone, in which a connection between a handset of said telephone and a base unit to be connected to a telephone network, i.e. a base station part, is established by a radio connection. The base unit measures an RF signal received from the handset and produces a warning tone in a handset earpiece of said telephone if the RF signal level is below a minimum threshold value that is necessary for maintaining the connection between the base station unit and the handset part. Said warning signal is implemented such that despite the handset part is beyond the normal operating area of the cordless telephone the user of said handset part is able to hear said warning signal. The base station unit transmits a predetermined number of warning signals and if the handset part does not return to the operating area of the base station unit, the base station unit is disconnected from the telephone network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the operating range of said cordless telephones is several hundreds of meters in a space without obstacles and several tens of meters even indoors. Thus, in the case of an average user, the handset relatively seldom gets beyond the operating range. In addition, a problem with the above-described solution is that the warning is only given in the form of a warning tone. A subdued or high-frequency warning tone may remain unheard, for instance, if the user has greater difficulties than what is normal in hearing sounds. A loud warning tone, in turn, may be unpleasant to the user. In the cordless telephone described in the above publication it is an obvious way to give the warning to the user in the form of sound, because the use of the cordless telephone is restricted to speech only, and typically it does not comprise a display where the user would receive visual information. Moreover, in a noisy environment the user does not necessarily hear the sound and therefore it is advantageous to have also other types of out-of-range warnings, as will appear when the invention is described in greater detail. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A method and a system are now invented for short-range radio communication, in which method a short-range rf access point monitors signal strengths of terminals within its area. When the signal coming from the terminal is so weak that it can be assumed to be at the extreme end of its range (threshold value), said short-range rf access point informs it about the situation. The information transmitted by the access point is advantageously visual information on the display of the terminal and/or speech information, such as synthesized speech in the loudspeaker of the terminal. A warning message appearing on the display is particularly useful in a noisy environment or when the user typically watches the display (netsurfing or general data transmission). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The user of the terminal remains aware of the extreme limits of the connection used and of the possibility to maintain the connection before its maintenance becomes impossible due to the range. It is a useful operation to guide the user of the terminal, because the user does not necessarily know the location of the access point when moving about for the first time in an area unknown to him. In the above-described prior art publication, this is not done, and need not be done, because, in general, the user of the handset is aware of the location of the base station unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the invention implements a method for an access point advising a terminal of a change in the quality of a short-range radio connection between the terminal and the access point, which method comprises establishing a short-range radio connection between said terminal and said access point, monitoring, by said access point, the strength of a radio-frequency signal transmitted by said terminal, comparing, by said access point, the strength of the radio-frequency signal transmitted by said terminal with a predetermined threshold value, characterized by transmitting a message to the terminal by said access point if said signal strength is below said predetermined threshold value, the message comprising information on said connection quality change to be presented in said terminal, the information being at least one of the following: visual information and speech information. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A third aspect of the invention implements an electronic device, which is able to communicate in a short-range communication system, the device comprising connection establishment means for establishing a connection with a short-range terminal, characterized in that the device further comprises reception means for receiving the signal strength of said terminal, comparison means for comparing said signal strength with a predetermined threshold value and transmission means for transmitting information to the terminal in response to the performed comparison, the information comprising an item about a change in the quality of the connection and being at least one of the following: visual information and speech information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A fourth aspect of the invention implements a short-range terminal which is able to communicate in a short-range communication system, the terminal comprising means for establishing a connection with a short-range rf access point, characterized in that the device also comprises transmission means for transmitting the signal strength of said terminal to said access point, reception means for receiving information from said access point in response to the transmitted signal, the information comprising an item on the change in the quality of the connection and being at least one of the following: visual information and speech information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A fifth aspect of the invention implements a computer software product for a short-range rf access point, the access point being able to communicate in a short-range communication network at least with one short-range terminal, and the computer software product comprises computer software means for establishing a connection between said access point and the short-range terminal, characterized in that the computer software product comprises computer software means for making said access point receive the signal of said terminal, computer software means for making said access point compare the strength of said signal with a predetermined threshold value and computer software means for making said access point transmit information to the terminal in response to the performed comparison, the information comprising an item about a change in the quality of the connection and being at least one of the following: visual information and speech information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a short-range radio system according to one embodiment of the invention. Operation of the radio system is described from the viewpoint of the Bluetooth system but the use of the invention is not restricted to said Bluetooth system only. The system comprises one or more access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and one or more short-range terminals <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> serves within range <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, access point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> serves within range <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> serves within range <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. If the transmission power of the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) exceeds that of the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>), the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) is able to receive messages from the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) beyond the range (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) of the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). This is an advantageous property, because the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) may already be so far away that the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) does not necessarily receive the communication from the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) properly, but it can be assumed that the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) receives a warning from the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) that the connection may be disconnected. This advantageous property is typical in the Bluetooth environment, because the transmission power used in Bluetooth circuits for portable devices, such as terminals, is presumably lower than in Bluetooth circuits integrated in fixed access points. The Bluetooth protocol supports monitoring of the quality of the signal, so it can be directly used for monitoring the extreme limit between the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) and the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the following, communication between two different Bluetooth devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is described by way of an example. Terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> communicates with access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> communicates with access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> sends inquiries to its environment within range <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in order to establish a connection between other Bluetooth terminals or devices and in order to form a pico network with said terminals or devices. Prior to a first contact terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is in a standby mode, listening to traffic in its area. Access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> acts as a host device within range <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, forming a pico network, to which a maximum of seven terminals can be attached. Access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> takes care of call establishment to terminals to be attached to the pico network by searching for devices in the vicinity and exchanges data, for instance, on clock-offset and device addresses according to the Bluetooth protocol. Access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transmits a paging message in its environment if the address of the target device is known and an inquiry message if the address of the target device is not known, and when terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> receives said paging message an SPD (Service Discovery Protocol) session begins between said terminals. During the SPD session all necessary information for forming a Bluetooth connection is collected e.g. from terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The information necessary for connection establishment can comprise e.g. the Bluetooth category of the devices, because Bluetooth devices must be able to identify one another and find out the capabilities and properties of the identified devices. Because Bluetooth technology is well suited for a variety of devices, it cannot be expected that all devices have the same capabilities. Therefore, the devices have been divided into categories, each of which supporting a particular set of properties. In this manner, it is possible to apply software modules suitable for communication depending on which kind of devices intercommunicate. After the necessary data for establishing a Bluetooth connection have been collected, a free radio channel can be allocated for the connection, and terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can start communication, such as data transmission, with access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The access point may be located e.g. in business premises, where a seller gives information on his products via access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to a possible buyer, i.e. in this case to the user of terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives the signal transmitted by terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, and on the basis of the signal strength said access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is able to determine whether the distance of terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> from access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is on the border area of range <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If the level of the signal transmitted by terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> falls below a predetermined threshold value, access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transmits information to terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> about deterioration of the quality of the connection. The information comprises e.g. an audiovisual message guiding the user, such as a text message to be presented on the display of the terminal and/or a synthesized speech message, which can read as follows &ldquo;connection may disconnect, please go back along the route you have travelled&rdquo;, to be advised to the user of terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the information can comprise a message about the location of the access point in the premises e.g. &ldquo;connection may disconnect, please go towards leisure department sign&rdquo;. The message can be shown on the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, for instance, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. If access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are also located in the same business premises in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the information can then also comprise e.g. the location of said access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, for instance, access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> invites the user of terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to move closer to access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by transmitting to terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> a message &ldquo;walk towards food department sign and you will have information on our new products&rdquo;. If the signal falls below the threshold value, a new value can be measured after a short delay before a warning is transmitted, this allows avoiding unnecessary messages that are generated when the terminal moves to possible shadow areas within the range. In the Bluetooth system, the above-mentioned delay can be e.g. one or more time slots (one time slot being 625 microseconds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the connection between devices <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is terminated, one of the parties transmits an LMP (Link Manager Protocol) detach message, which terminates the connection between the parties. If terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is already beyond range <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and cannot thus transmit the LMP detach message to access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, said access point <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can transmit said message to terminal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> if the quality of the connection does not change within a predetermined threshold value, for instance a given time (e.g. 5 seconds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another example terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> moves away from access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> towards access point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, for instance, along a corridor in business premises. Access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> detects that a signal transmitted by the terminal is below a predetermined threshold value, whereby access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as in the previous example, can transmit a request to the user of terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to go back along the route travelled or to inform the user about another access point, such as access point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and to request the user to go towards said access point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> intercommunicate and ranges <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> form an area where the user of terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can move about such that a connection to at least one of access points <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is maintained, access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is able to inform access point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> about terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, whereby access point <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can take over and serve the user of terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> from the point where access point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> left, or alternatively to serve the user of the terminal with new information. A previous application U.S. Ser. No. 09/803,534 of the Applicant discloses a method and a system, in which a user can move from one access point to another within a short-range radio-frequency network without that the connection is apparently disconnected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If a plurality of access points communicate with one another, it is also possible to determine, on the basis of the information they receive from terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the location of said terminal, whereby the network coverage area and the current location of the user of terminal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in said network area can be defined more precisely for the user. A previous FI patent 106,655 of the Applicant discloses a method and a system for positioning a transmitter, which can be applied to a short-range rf network. In a network like this it is possible to inform the terminal, by utilizing positioning, when it might be exiting the network area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) is communicating with the access point (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>), the access point advantageously tends to act as a host device, so the terminal (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) is advantageously a slave device, thus the terminal cannot search for other connections but the host device, i.e. the access point, has to tell the terminal about possibilities prior to disconnection, and not until the old connection is disconnected, can the terminal receive information from a new access point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a flow chart of a method according to one embodiment of the invention at an access point. In step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the access point transmits a paging message to its environment. In step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a reply is received from a terminal. In step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, a connection is established to the terminal. In step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, strength of the signal transmitted by the terminal is measured. In step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, it is examined if the signal level is below a predetermined threshold value. If not, steps <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are repeated until the signal level is below said threshold value and step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is proceeded to. In step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, information about deterioration of the quality of the connection is transmitted to the terminal. In step <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, it is again examined if the signal level is below said threshold value. If the signal level is below said threshold value, step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is proceeded. Alternatively, in step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> it is possible to have a pause after the first measurement and remeasure the signal level, whereby temporary movement of the terminal into a shadow area, or any other corresponding disturbance caused by signal strength deterioration can be avoided in the measurement result. In step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the terminal is informed about the location of a second access point, and in step <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, the connection to the terminal is terminated. The above-described different steps of the method can be implemented e.g. as a computer software product, which comprises computer software means for making said access point implement the steps set forth in said method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a flow chart of a method according to one embodiment of the invention at a terminal. In step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, an Inquiry from an access point is received. In step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the inquiry from the access point is answered with an Inquiry Response. In step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, a connection is established to the access point. In step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a signal is transmitted to the access point. In step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, it is examined if the access point has transmitted a message, and if not, steps <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are repeated until a message (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) is received from the access point and said message is forwarded to the user of the device, the message comprising a warning of the quality of the connection being deteriorated. In step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, it is examined again if a new message is transmitted from the access point, and if not, e.g. in the case that the user of the device has moved closer to the access point and the quality of the connection has improved, step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is proceeded. If a message is received in step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is proceeded to and the message is presented to the user of the device, which message may comprise the location of a second access point, for instance. In step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, the ongoing connection to the access point is terminated. The above-described different steps of the method can be implemented e.g. as a computer software product, which comprises computer software means for making said access point implement the steps set forth in said method. </paragraph>
