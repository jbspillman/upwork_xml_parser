<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to method and apparatus allowing visual access to the interior of a tire wheel assembly under dynamic conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wheel rim having a window or access area such that the interior of a tire mounted on the wheel rim may be viewed under dynamic conditions such as those provided by a dynamometer test machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Vibration felt by a vehicle driver through the vehicle seat, steering wheel, and acceleration pedal are typically directly related to force variations encountered at the tire footprint which may be caused by a variety of sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, imbalance of the tire wheel assembly, runout of the wheel and/or tire, irregularities in the structure of the tire (non-uniformity), brake drag, wheel misalignment, road disturbances, worn linkages, etc. In recent years, automobile vehicles weights have been generally declining in order to improve gas mileage. A result of the weight loss is that the suspensions and wheel support parts have become lighter and more susceptible to vibration. Vibration, especially vibration due to non-uniformity of the tire and imbalance due to tire and/or wheel runout, is now a prominent issue for tire manufactures who are also under economic pressure to do more with less. In addition, lead balance weights used to correct tire wheel assembly imbalance, long considered a health concern, will likely be banned and a replacement for lead will need to be used to manufacture the weights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has long been known that inserting various materials into the interior of a tire wheel assembly could provide a benefit of balancing the tire wheel assembly. Internal flowable materials have long been used as a staple for many fleet managers in the trucking industry to help combat vibration, promote even tire wear, and extend tire life. The cause behind this benefit has been described in a variety of manners, the most common being the principle of mass balancing. Based on this theory, during tire rotation, free flowing materials contained the tire wheel assembly will seek a distribution in balance about the center of rotation and will tend to offset any imbalance inherent in the tire wheel assembly. However, while the performance of the internal materials could be verified both subjectively and by objectively by testing, none of the theories on the way the internal materials worked could be substantiated because it was impossible to see into the interior of the tire wheel assembly to see how the materials acted under operating conditions. Furthermore, without proving the mechanics of how the internal flowable material works, it has been recognized that at least some internally flowable materials not only work to reduce the vibratory effects of imbalance, but also work to reduce force variations due to non-uniformity of the tire as well as dampening other sources of vibration and noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, internal flowable materials are positioned to help the tire and vehicle manufactures provide a better ride for their customers. However, testing variations of different materials may be necessary to optimize the make-up and/or amount of internal flowable material for a particular tire/vehicle application. This testing could be facilitated by a definite knowledge and comparison of how the internal flowable materials react to forces within the tire under dynamic conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Other problems with the state of the prior art is with unsubstantiated and competing claims by some internal flowable material manufacturers which may confuse potential consumers as to how a product actually performs within a tire. With the introduction of various competing internally flowable materials, additional theories have been forwarded by these manufacturer in order to substantiate claims of superior performance of a particular material. As an example, one such manufacture using a material comprising glass beads has claimed that their glass beads, once properly positioned by the rotation of the tire wheel assembly to a position causing balance of the tire wheel assembly, will remain in this balancing position along the innerliner of the tire due to electrostatic cling produced by the tribological forces generated by the glass beads rubbing against the innerliner of the tire and against each other. The manufacturer has claimed that the glass beads remaining in position provided a benefit in that the internal balancing compound did not become displaced when the vehicle stopped, thus the tire wheel assembly remained in a dynamically balanced condition. As with the theories as to how these internal flowable materials worked, the electrostatic cling theory could not be substantiated or disproved because it was impossible to see into the interior of the tire wheel assembly to see how the materials acted under operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are a multitude of additional problems related to the inability to view the interior of a tire wheel assembly. Improved performance tests could be developed such as monitoring the development of innerliner cracking or monitoring specific interior areas of the tires under specialized test conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there remains a need in the art for a wheel and method that will enable the interior of the tire wheel assembly to be viewed under operating conditions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Reference is first made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings which shows the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention having at least one window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> positioned in the tubewell section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be made of any appropriate transparent material which has sufficient strength such as various known plastic materials. The window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be fastened to the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using appropriate fasteners <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a gasket or sealant <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> around the perimeter to prevent loss of air pressure. Alternatively, the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be bonded to the tubewell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with an adhesive, or attached in any appropriate manner. Still another alternative would be a hinged window that would allow access into the interior of the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when an attached tire in unpressurized. This would prevent the need to dismount the tire from the wheel rim when inserting or removing an object from the tire wheel assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned and of sufficient width and length to view a substantial portion of the interior surface or innerliner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a tire <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted on the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form a tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As shown, window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned on the tubewell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> portion of wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is large enough to allow viewing of the entire innerliner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the tire footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is under loaded conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, an alternate embodiment of window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; comprise a hinge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which enables window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; to be opened when tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in unpressurized. The window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is sealed by releasable seal or gasket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the tire wheel assembly is unpressurized, the gasket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> holds the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; in place. Although not shown, it is also contemplated that the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; could be held shut by a rotatable bar, a releasable snap, latch, or other holding mechanism which can be relatively quickly opened to allow access to the interior of the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When inflated, the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably shaped and positioned such that the air pressure will help seal and retain the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; in position, such as by flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> flowable material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been inserted into the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is visible on the innerliner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the tire <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Under dynamic conditions, the reaction of the flowable material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to dynamic loads at the tire footprint (as well as any location around the tire) can be studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the visual set-up is shown. A camera <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is positioned on the inboard side of the wheel rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and directed toward window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown positioned over the tire footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is adjacent dynamometer wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Flowable material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inserted into the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is visible through window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and camera <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A strobe light <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is also directed toward window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, shown positioned over the tire footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> against dynamometer wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to a dynamometer carriage <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which forces the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> against dynamometer wheel <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The strobe light <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provides sufficient illumination of the innerliner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the tire <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. During dynamic conditions, the strobe light <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is coordinated with the rotational speed of the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that the strobe light only flashes when the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is directly in the frame of camera <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> such as when it is overtop footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or at any other predetermined location. This enables video or still from camera <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to provide a frame by frame shot of the tire innerliner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for each rotation of the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When directed at the tire footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the reaction of the inserted flowable material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to dynamic loads can be studied. By rotating the camera <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and strobe light <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to different radial positions of the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the reaction of the inserted flowable material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> positioned away from the footprint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the method <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for viewing the interior of the tire <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> under dynamic conditions is depicted. The method <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises the steps of providing a tire wheel assembly comprising a tire mounted on a wheel rim having at least one window positioned to allow the interior of tire to be viewed <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>; positioning a camera at a predetermined location with respect to the tire wheel assembly where the camera is directed toward the window wherein the camera can provide an image of the interior of the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>; and causing the tire wheel assembly to rotate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In addition, other steps may be included to help view the interior of the tire wheel assembly such as positioning a strobe light at a predetermined location with respect to the tire wheel assembly where the strobe light is directed toward the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and coordinating a light flash from the strobe light to correspond with the rotational position and rotational speed of the window <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. When using the method with flowable materials the method may include the steps of inserting a flowable material into the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and recording the movement of the flowable materials in the rotating tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The method may also include the steps of applying a load force upon the tire wheel assembly against a test surface <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and recording the force variations in the rotating tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition to providing a method and apparatus for viewing the interior of the tire <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> under dynamic conditions, the window <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the interior tire surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be checked after the tire wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stops rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is especially effective for viewing flowable materials inserted into the pressure chamber of tire wheel assembly under dynamic conditions, it is contemplated that the tire wheel assembly window can be used for other tests related to tire performance such as monitoring the development of innerliner cracking or monitoring specific interior areas of the tires under specialized test conditions. It is also contemplated that different types of cameras such as infrared or other types may be used to provide useful information regarding the interior of the tire. Although not specifically shown it is contemplated that the present invention could be used on any dynamometer or Flat-Trac&reg; type testing machine, as well as used in conjunction with an on-vehicle set up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, two alternate embodiments are shown which also provide a method for viewing the interior of tire under dynamic conditions. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed through the tubewell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide an access area for a camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a light source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. An insert <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, typically a rubber grommet or the like, is used in the aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to keep air from escaping through the aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A sealant may also be used alone or in conjunction with the insert <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connected via a flexible harness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to a power source and a recording/viewing apparatus (not shown). The flexible harness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> must rotate with the tire/wheel assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce the stress on the harness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the harness is typically attached to the wheel (such as with plastic ties) and used with a slip ring (not shown) or other type device to prevent damage to the harness. These devices are known in the art and commonly used with strain gages. It is contemplated the camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and light <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be remotely controlled to view different areas of the tire interior. It is noted that the camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> should be mounted securely to the wheel to prevent vibration of the camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>/light source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> while the wheel in rotating. Accordingly, the end of the harness or the camera <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>/light source <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be attached to the interior tubewell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> surface using an industrial adhesive or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> remote wireless camera <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a remote light source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with self-contained power source are shown attached to the interior of the tubewell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The wireless feature of the camera <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> allow the camera and light source to be used without the requirement of a harness or additional instrumentation. The views of the interior are transmitted by the camera transmitter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to a local receiver (not shown).
