<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a pen of the type stated in the preamble to claims 1 and 19. Moreover the invention relates to a method for removing a pen point according to the preamble to claim 16 and a clip according to the preamble to claim 20. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A type of pen which occurs frequently on the market has a pen body with an ink stick which is removably arranged therein and which at its one end has a pen point and is insertable and extractable through the open end of the pen body. An ink cartridge with a pen point is referred to as ink stick. Access is gained to the ink stick by removing a nose cone which is screwably arranged on the front part of the pen body and which, when being unscrewed, leaves such a long part of the cartridge behind that the user can remove the cartridge by hand from the pen body when, for instance, exchanging the cartridge. The nose cone has a plurality of drawbacks. It must be unscrewed, which makes the exchange of the ink cartridge difficult. The nose cone is a loose part which can easily be lost when exchanging the ink cartridge. Moreover the nose cone makes the manufacture of the pen more expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,088 shows how a clip arranged on the cap of the pen can be used for form-fit engagement with a specially adapted nose cone, the clip/cap serving as a lever to unscrew the nose cone from the pen body. A problem of the clip according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,088 is that the pen point must be specially designed or alternatively must be combined with a nose cone. Moreover the possibilities of designing the pen are limited by the construction of the clip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> EP-0 657 301 A1 shows how a pen point can be extracted from a pen body with the aid of an engaging means arranged on the cap. The engaging means is designed for form-fit engagement with a specially adapted groove in an adaptor sleeve mounted around the pen point. Some problems of the engaging means according to EP-0 657 301 A1 are its restriction of the possibilities of designing the pen, the risk of it getting stuck, for instance, in the user&apos;s clothes, and the necessary cooperation with a specially adapted adaptor sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Besides conventional writing materials, also so-called digital pens have recently been developed, which contain sensors and electronics for digital recording of what is being written by means of the pen on a base. Different types of sensors can be arranged in the pen for determining its position, for instance acceleration sensors, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,371 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,666, optical sensors, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,792, U.S. Pat. No. 5,852,434 and WO 00/73983, pressure sensors, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,104,388, or mechanical sensors, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,792 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,666. For reasons of security, the pen body of such digital pens is frequently designed to prevent access to the interior of the pen and the sensitive components therein. The ink stick is therefore inserted into a duct extending into the pen body from its writing end. Like in ordinary pens of this type, it is difficult for the user to exchange the ink stick, whether the pen has a nose cone or not. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a pen according to the invention is shown, comprising a pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an ink cartridge arranged in the pen body and having a pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a part, such as a clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is removably arranged on the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The ink cartridge <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may form an ink stick which is exchangeable in its entirety. Alternatively, the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and define a distinguishable part, filling of the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being allowed after removal of the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the ink stick in its entirety can be releasably arranged in the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in various ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, it is possible to use some kind of fit between complementary elements which may be arranged projecting from the inner wall of the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and/or from the pen point/ink stick, and which may cooperate to cause locking or anchoring of the pen point or ink stick, which anchoring can be released under the action of a pulling force exerted on the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such elements may comprise, for instance, flaps, beads etc. Alternatively, it is possible to form the inside of the pen body so that the pen point or ink stick is kept in place by press fit, which can also be neutralized under the action of a pulling force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Various examples of means for adequate exertion of the above-mentioned pulling force follow below. In all cases, these means are included in a part which is removably arranged on the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A common feature of the following exemplifying embodiments is that they allow squeezing engagement with the pen point, so that the pen point can be extracted from the pen body, for instance for exchanging the ink stick or for filling the ink cartridge. The application of the pulling force can, via the squeezing engagement, be executed independently of the nature of the pen point. If the pen point has, for instance, an essentially smooth peripheral surface, the squeezing engagement may result in a frictional force which is sufficient to allow application of the pulling force. If the pen point instead has a profiled peripheral surface, the component or components applying squeezing forces may engage arbitrary protrusions, grooves, flaps etc. on the peripheral surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The accompanying drawings illustrate several examples of how the squeezing engagement can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the clip can be provided with a hole in the form of a through hole. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 7</cross-reference>, the clip and a protective cap, respectively, can be provided with a hole in the form of a blind hole. By &ldquo;blind hole&rdquo; is meant a non-through hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The shown holes in the form of through holes and blind holes may have a constant cross-section in depth. Alternatively, this cross-section may vary (not shown) over the depth of the hole. Thus, the hole can be tapering or widening in depth. The openings of a through hole may also be of different configurations, for instance different sizes or shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 8</cross-reference>, the squeezing engagement can be performed by interaction between two parts, such as a holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a counterflange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the clip in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, or the cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiments where the means arranged on the movable part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, this is formed so that it may be caused, by squeezing action, to engage the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for extraction thereof. The hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is dimensioned, so that by exerting a force, for instance a frictional force, it may temporarily hold the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to allow removal thereof from the pen body. The hole may have different shapes. A simple embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, where the hole is essentially circular. According to an alternative embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the hole is elongate and has wedge-shaped end portions. In the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the hole is formed as a triangle, and in the embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the hole has the form of a &ldquo;keyhole&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is shown how a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as described above can be used to remove the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and thus optionally the entire ink stick, from the pen body. The pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is caused to engage in the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by inclination/angling of these two relative to each other. In step B, the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is placed in the hole. In step C, the pen body is angled so that the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fastened in the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and in step D the pen point/ink stick is extracted. The actions that are taken in step C are modifiable according to the appearance of function of the hole. The engagement between the clip and the pen point may be used to remove the latter by unscrewing it from the pen body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be formed as a separate elongate holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), which at one end is attached to the pen body or a protective cap and which at its other end possibly has a bend <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or bead which acts to better hold the pen in place when carried, for instance, in a user&apos;s pocket. The elongate holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the clip may be elongate, for instance rectangular, in cross-section, so that a flat side is formed, as is evident from FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the clip has a fixing flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which makes an angle with the elongate holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the clip. The angle may be right, but other, larger or smaller, angles are feasible. The fixing flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be releasably anchored to the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the rear end thereof, for instance by means of a screw, a locking pin, a snap connection, via a press fit or some other fixing means having an equivalent function. Alternatively, the fixing flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may correspondingly be releasably anchored in a groove extending transversely of the longitudinal direction of the pen, which groove may be formed in the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the protective cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The clip in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> has a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the fixing flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in the form of a through hole or a blind hole for the above engagement with the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Alternatively (not shown), the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be formed in the holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the hole, a counterflange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be arranged, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, to extend under the bend <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip at a distance therefrom and be connected with the holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, possibly via a fixing flange <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as described above. When removing the pen point/ink stick, the pen point is inserted into a variable gap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is defined between the bend <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip and the counterflange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the engagement being provided by pressing together the bend <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip and the counterflange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, like the jaws of a pair of pliers or the legs of a pair of tweezers. It will be appreciated that the bend <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the clip can be formed in various ways, to provide a desired squeezing effect and to improve the holding of the pen when carried, for instance, in a pocket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment (not shown), a projection may be arranged adjacent to the gap, on the holding part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and/or on the counterflange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the engagement being performed or facilitated by means of this projection, which may have, for instance, a sharp edge, a hole of a shape adapted to the general cross-section of pen points, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to another variant, a variable gap may be formed in the flat side of the clip. For instance, a hole of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> may serve as such a gap, with a suitable selection of material and material thickness around the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, there is a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the form of a blind hole in the clip, so formed that the pen point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be caused to engage the boundary surfaces of the hole. Also in this embodiment, the hole may have a cross-section varying in depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one more embodiment of a pen according to the invention is shown, in which the part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is removably arranged on the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is a protective gap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This clip may, like in the embodiments described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, have a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on its flat side in the form of one or more through holes or blind holes. Such a clip may be formed in one piece with the protective cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, or as a separate part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An alternative is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, viz. a cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with an engaging hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in its one, normally closed end. It will be appreciated that the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can either be a blind hole or a through hole, and that the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be arranged in an arbitrary position in the cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which shows one end of a cap with a clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, seen from the open end of the cap, there may be formed according to a further alternative, on the underside of the clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at its distal end, a projection with a hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for engaging the pen point projecting from the pen body. Alternatively or besides (not shown), the projection can be formed on the pen body to define said hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For removing the pen point or the ink stick, the pen point can be inserted into the hole <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, after which the cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the pen body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are angled to each other to provide the engagement similarly to the above embodiments involving a through hole or a blind hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative to the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> variable cap may be formed between the clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for instance at the distal end of the cap as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, or along the extent of the clip along the peripheral surface of the cap (cf. the space between the clip and the cap in the side view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In order to remove the pen point, this is inserted into the gap, from the short side or long side of the cap, after which the user can press the clip against the cap to provide the squeezing engagement with the pen point, like the jaws of a pair of pliers or the legs of a pair of tweezers. According to one variant (not shown), a projection can be formed adjacent to the gap, on the clip and/or on the cap, the engagement being provided or facilitated by means of this projection, which may have, for instance, a sharp edge, a hole of a shape adapted to the general cross-section of pen points, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Finally, it should be emphasized that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and may be varied within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
