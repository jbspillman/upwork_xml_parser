<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an aggregate bearing in bushing form, having an outer ring which is provided with an elastomeric coating, and an inner support part, as well as rubber springs arranged in-between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the known aggregate bearings of this kind, the rubber springs are vulcanized into the gap between the outer ring and the support part. This method tends to cause the rubber springs to shrink during the cooling of the bearing after vulcanization, resulting in an enlargement of the gap, which can have a disadvantageous effect on the desired bearing characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid the above-mentioned disadvantage, it has become known from German Patent 3 840 176 C2 to insert an additional element into the gap thus enlarged, thereby achieving elastic prestressing. Bearings whose outer ring surface is not provided with an elastomeric coating may be calibrated without difficulty during installation in an appropriate mounting support. Calibration also makes it possible to design the aggregate bearing without the mentioned additional element and to install it in the mounting device. In doing so, the gap is entirely or at least partially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when working with bearings whose outer ring is provided with an elastomeric coating, this calibration is difficult to accomplish. On the other hand, the elastomeric coating has the advantage of making redundant the relatively expensive corrosion protection for the metallic outer ring. Generally, rubber springs are designed with an axial penetration, which, however, again has the disadvantage that the axial penetration (and the shrinkage measurement) must be bridged in rebound travel, which may be incompatible with the spring characteristic required by the customer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to create an aggregate bearing that can be manufactured inexpensively and in which the progression course of the spring action has an early onset, despite the existence of an axial penetration and a shrinkage gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention are achieved in an aggregate bearing in bushing form having an outer ring provided with an elastomeric coating and an inner support part as well as rubber springs arranged in-between; in order to achieve the desired bearing characteristic, axial penetrations are provided between the outer ring and the inner support part or stop buffer bearing the main load, in that prior to the bearing being put into use for the first time, the stop buffer located in the main load direction, and the inner elastomeric coating of the outer ring are connected to one another by at least one cross-piece arranged in the axial direction of the bearing and designed as a preset rupture joint.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Designing the bearing in such a way makes it possible to produce a bearing having an axial penetration, so that the disadvantages due to shrinkage are eliminated. In the finished bearing, there is a gap between the outer ring of the bearing and the stop buffer at the axial penetration, the size of the gap resulting from the shrinkage measurement of the rubber springs and the free path formed by the axial penetration. The cross-piece remaining between the inner support part, i.e. stop buffer, and the outer ring is unable to withstand the forces occurring during shrinkage. When the bearing is being put into use for the first time, the cross-piece ruptures at the preset rupture joint. The portions of the ruptured cross piece that remain on the outer ring and the stop buffer, respectively, have a surprisingly advantageous effect on the progression of the spring action. An earlier stop occurs during rebound since first the ruptured ends of the cross-piece come to rest against one another. Depending on the design, they have a distinct effect on the spring characteristic of the bearing. Essentially, aggregate bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is made of outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an elastomeric coating <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, inner support part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well as rubber springs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Stop buffer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is stub-shaped, is located on the upper part of support part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Axial penetrations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are located between stop buffer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Stop buffer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is located in main load direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is indicated by arrows. Bracing of the bearing is mainly provided by springs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> designed in v-shape. A stop buffer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged between springs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> During production of the bearing, cross-piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which connects elastomeric coating <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to stop buffer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, remains between the two axial penetrations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The gap dimension of penetrations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is generally subject to production techniques. It is also possible to provide for a plurality of cross-pieces with their preset rupture joints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in longitudinal section. The longitudinal section corresponds to a section in main load direction <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The length of cross-piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be seen here, which is shorter in the exemplary embodiment than the length of bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a flange-like formation on its left side and is entirely surrounded by elastomeric coating <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Support part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is made of metal and is braced on spring legs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. During the first spring deflection of the bearing, the distance traveled by support part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is so large that cross-piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ruptures. However, torn cross-piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its parts will exert an influence again when bearing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rebounds and support part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the stop buffer moves upward until the impact initially against the cross-piece parts, and then against outer ring <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
