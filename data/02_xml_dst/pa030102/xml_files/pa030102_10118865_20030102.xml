<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Methods, compositions and articles of manufacture for binding histidine containing proteins to substrates are provided. A substrate having reactive groups is contacted with a substrate modifier comprising a silane, a linker, and an active site to form an activated substrate. The activated substrate is then reacted with a reagent that binds to the active site and comprises a ligand that can bind to a metal ion to form a chelator which is then chelated to a metal ion to form a metal-chelated substrate. A histidine-containing protein having an arrangement of histidine residues that can bind to two available cis valencies on the chelated metal ion is then incubated with the metal-chelated substrate to form a protein-substrate complex. The protein can be deposited in a pattern through any suitable technique. The protein is bound in an active form allowing it to perform native functions, including enzymatic functions. In one aspect, the protein is a silicatein that can incorporate optionally derivatized silicas and/or silicones onto the substrate. The methods can be used in multiplex form to deposit pluralities of different proteins on a substrate. Sensors, biocatalysts and microfluidic devices incorporating such protein-substrate complexes are also provided. Kits comprising reagents for performing such methods are also provided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nature has devised many ways in which to place proteins at precise locations. The ultrastructure of organisms, cell migration, development, formation of cytological structure and intracellular trafficking all rely on the controlled localization of proteins for their proper occurrence. In biological formation of structures, controlled localization of proteins can lead to elegant designs. The huge variety of diatom structures created under ambient conditions is an example of the exquisite results that can be achieved through control over protein localization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Efforts by man to imitate nature in localizing proteins have been relatively crude and limited. However, advances in cellular and molecular biology have revealed a number of ways in which proteins are targeted to specific intracellular and extracellular locations. Scientists have been able to utilize the targeting signals identified in such experiments to target proteins to new locations inside the cell and within the organism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Proteins have previously been attached in bulk to a number of matrices such as agarose. But many known techniques for attaching proteins to substrates result in the inactivation of much of the protein used. This is disadvantageous where the function of the protein and its normal interactions with other molecules is to be studied or utilized, particularly where the amount of protein available is costly or limited. Furthermore, known methods can be limited in the degree of surface derivatization achieved. Additionally, in many instances it is desirable to be able to place proteins in particular locations rather than randomly, for example in forming protein arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a need in the art for methods of localizing proteins onto substrates, and for devices, compositions and articles of manufacture useful in such methods.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a fluorescent image of silica deposited on a substrate through histidine-tagged silicatein alpha protein bound to the substrate via the bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine (BCML) route described in Example 1. Cover slips were reacted to produce nickel-chelates on their surface. Histidine-tagged silicatein alpha was incubated with the coverslips in a Tris buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 wt. % CHAPS). The cover slips were then rinsed with buffer and placed in a tube containing 0.75 mls tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) with 0.45 mls of buffer (containing 2.5 uM PDMPO, a fluorescent substrate that can be incorporated into silica by silicateins). Long exposures of the activated substrates to BCML were found to be disadvantageous. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The attachments of proteins to a variety of substrates has great potential in applications such as sensors, biocatalysts, or as &ldquo;instruments on a chip.&rdquo; This is especially true in the situation where arrays of proteins can be created or when the protein can be attached to mesoporous substrates such as mesoporous silica. Nickel, cobalt and copper NTA complexes are known to bind 6&times;-His tagged proteins and are used commercially on agarose and other substrates for protein purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention provides multistep methods in which chelating groups can be added to substrates in order to bind histidine-containing proteins to the substrate. These multistep methods allow for a high degree of control during synthesis, and permit production of substrates having a very high coverage of their surface area with chelating groups. Such high degrees of control and of surface derivatization have not previously been available. The methods advantageously employ reagents which form a final linker between the chelating group and the substrate that is resistant to reducing conditions, and can be used in the presence of mercaptans and other reducing agents without destroying the linker and releasing the histidine-containing protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The methods have application in any technique where catalysts or supports for enzymes are used, for example in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, nutrients, nutraceuticals, fine chemicals, hydrocarbon cracking, and in energy production and transduction. The methods can also be used to create nanoporous or mesoporous silicas which can be surfactant or copolymer templated and of hexagonal or cubic geometry. The methods can be used to create templates for controlling polymerization of materials, and to form waveguides for photonic applications. The methods can be used for controlling structure and placement at different length scales, in electronic and photonic applications, in the separation of materials, and in microfluidics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The methods can be used in the formation of sensors, biocatalysts, instruments on a chip, protein arrays, protein chips, biochips, biosensors, and catalysts. Arrays of catalysts can be anchored on a substrate via the methods of the invention, and can be used for assembly line catalysis when deposited in a specific pattern or for bulk catalysis when deposited on a high surface area material like silica or other metallooxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Biosensors can be prepared in which proteins such as receptor proteins, antibodies, enzymes, ion channel proteins, and signal transducing proteins are attached to a sensing device via the methods of the invention and used to detect the binding of a specific analyte whose presence is to be detected and quantified. Proteins can be attached to the surface of a CCD chip, for example, via the methods of the invention where the proteins directly or indirectly emit, can be made to emit, or are linked to a molecule that emits, light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Multiplex methods are provided employing 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or more different proteins on a substrate. Also provided is an article formed by the reaction of a substrate having active oxygen atoms, active hydroxyl groups, or a combination thereof, and a substrate modifier of the general formula N,N&prime;-bis-(trialkoxysilylalkyl)ethylene diamine. Also provided are the substrate modifier itself, as well as the N,N&prime;-biscarboxymethylated form. Kits comprising components useful for such methods are also provided. </paragraph>

The substrate can be aluminum, alumina, a ferrous material, or any reactive metallooxide. The substrate can be a zeolite or a nanoporous, microporous, or mesoporous silica (Zhao et al., Science 279:548, 1998; Zhao et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120:6024-6036, 1998; Margolese et al., Chem. Mater. 12:2448-2459, 2000). The substrate may have a high surface area, such as silica and other metallooxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Silica sol-gels and aerogels can also be used as substrates, and can be prepared by methods known in the art. Aerogel substrates may be used as free standing substrates or as a surface coating for another substrate material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The substrate can take any form such as lamellar, spherical or planar, and typically is a plate, slide, bead, pellet, disk, wafer, cover slip, particle, strand, precipitate, optionally porous gel, sheets, tube, sphere, container, capillary, pad, slice, film, chip, CCD chip, multiwell plate or dish, optical fiber, etc. The substrate can be a monolith, and can be a functional structure such as a plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The substrate may contain raised or depressed regions on which a histidine-containing protein can be located. The surface of the substrate can be etched using well known techniques to provide for desired surface features, for example trenches, v-grooves, mesa structures, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Surfaces on the substrate can be composed of the same material as the substrate or can be made from a different material, and can be coupled to the substrate by chemical or physical means.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The substrate and/or its surface is generally resistant to, or is treated to resist, the conditions to which it is to be exposed, and can be optionally treated to remove any resistant material after exposure to such conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Still further techniques include bead based techniques such as those described in PCT US/93/04145 and pin based methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additional flow channel or spotting methods applicable to patterned deposition of reactants and/or proteins are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/980,523, filed Nov. 20, 1992, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261. Reagents are delivered to the substrate by either (1) flowing within a channel defined on predefined regions or (2) &ldquo;spotting&rdquo; on predefined regions. A protective coating such as a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating (depending upon the nature of the solvent) can be used over portions of the substrate to be protected, sometimes in combination with materials that facilitate wetting by the reactant solution in other regions. In this manner, the flowing solutions are further prevented from passing outside of their designated flow paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Typical dispensers include a micropipette optionally robotically controlled, an ink-jet printer, a series of tubes, a manifold, an array of pipettes, or the like so that various reagents can be delivered to the reaction regions sequentially or simultaneously.

For example, PMMA spin coated silicon wafers can be cut via electron beam lithography. Nickel metal can be applied via vapor deposition. The PMMA can then be lifted off. RIE (reactive ion etching) can be used to create nickel capped silicon features. Electron beams can be used to create 30 nm features with unlimited pattern capability. Master molds can be created, and stamp patterns can be formed by direct liquid or pattern transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The Substrate Modifier </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The substrate modifier is a molecule comprising a silane, a linker, and at least one active site. The silane comprises at least one leaving group such as an alkoxy group, a halogen (preferably chlorine), or an aryloxy group, and may contain two or three leaving groups, which may be the same or different (Crompton). Preferably the leaving group is an alkoxy group. Typically the silane comprises three leaving groups, for example trimethoxysilane or triethoxysilane, allowing for three points of attachment to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The substrate modifier can be of low molecular weight and/or generally linear structure to allow a high degree of surface derivatization. This can result not only in a high degree of incorporation of chelating groups onto the substrate, but also can limit the number of unreacted reactive groups on the substrate which might subsequently adversely affect protein structure or other aspects of the desired technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Examples of spacers or linkers are optionally substituted polyethyleneglycols, dicarboxylic acids, polyamines, straight, branched, and/or cyclic alkyls, aryls, alkylaryls, and combinations thereof. The linker preferably is inert and does not cause side reactions with the subsequent chemistry used. The linker may include one or more polymerizable groups, which can be used to form crosslinks between individual linkers after reaction of the substrate modifier with the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The active site is chosen so that it does not react with the substrate in the synthetic scheme employed. The active sites are optionally protected initially by protecting groups compatible with the synthesis scheme being used. Exemplary active sites include amine groups and glycidyl ethers. Among a wide variety of protecting groups which are useful are FMOC, BOC, t-butyl esters, t-butyl ethers, and the like. Various exemplary protecting groups are described in, for example, Atherton et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, IRL Press (1989). Preferred linkers are lower alkyls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Nonlimiting examples of the substrate modifier include glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, N,N&prime;-bis-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylene diamine, and halomethylphenyl (e.g., cloromethylphenyl, iodomethylphenyl) derivatives of silane. </paragraph>

Preferably two silane groups are included, but one silane group and its associated linker can optionally be deleted. Preferably the silane groups are bound to three leaving groups. Preferably Y and Z form an ethylene group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Incorporation of the Substrate Modifier </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The substrate modifier can be incorporated onto or into the substrate in a variety of ways. The substrate modifier may be reacted with reactive species on the surface of a preexisting substrate, and thereby form a surface-derivatized substrate. This can be done at ambient temperatures or can be accelerated by raising the temperature. The substrate is preferably moist to permit hydrolysis to occur. Trialkoxy silanes can react with active oxygens and/or active hydroxyls on the substrate via a condensation reaction. Reaction schemes can be used with a leaving group on the substrate as well, for example a halide, preferably a chloride; the substrate modifier can be reacted via hydrosilation to such a substrate, or via a Grignard or other organometallic reagent. The substrate modifier can also be introduced via reaction of a disilane bound to a linker bound to an active site; the disilane reacts with hydroxyl group(s) on the substrate to form an &mdash;O&mdash;Si&mdash; bond between the linker and the substrate. The substrate modifier can be incorporated into the substrate itself as it is formed. For example, a diamine such as N,N&prime;-bis-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylene diamine can be incorporated during polymerization of tetraethoxysilane to silica. Incorporation of the substrate modifier produces an activated substrate suitable for incorporation of a reagent via the active site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Conversion of the Activated Substrate into a Chelating Substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Conversion of the activated substrate into a chelating substrate is performed via derivatization of the active site with at least one reagent. The reagent must comprise a functional group that can react with the active site and also comprises or can be modified to comprise a ligand suitable for coordinating a metal ion that can coordinate a histidine residue. Exemplary reagents include bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine trisodium salt, and a haloacetic acid such as bromoacetic acid, which can also be used to modify bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine. The active site itself can form part of the chelating functionality, or the chelating functionality can be introduced entirely via the reagent(s). Preferably the functional group and the active site will not react with other components of the system, including the surface of the substrate, the metal ion to be chelated, or the protein to be bound to the metal chelate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The ligand is one that can coordinate with a hexavalent metal ion, and may be present in the reagent in an inactive form. The inactive form may be converted to an available ligand by either removal of a blocking group preventing access to the ligand, by addition of an additional reagent which adds an additional functionality necessary for chelation of the metal ion, or a combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Preferred chelators are of a form which can chelate a hexavalent metal ion, for example, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc, in a tetracoordinate fashion, leaving two available coordination sites on the metal ion. These available sites must be available in a cis orientation, at least transiently, in order for the histidine-containing protein to bind. Typical groups used to chelate the metal ion include those with available electrons, including carboxylate and amine groups. Cobalt and copper are preferred to nickel for uses in which less reversible binding of the histidine-containing protein is desired for maintaining protein localization, while nickel is preferred for uses in which reversible binding of histidine-containing proteins is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The chelating functionality can be in the form of a nitrilotriacetic acid. The chelating functionality can be in the form of a biscarboxymethyl ethylene or propylene diamine. Nonlimiting examples of the chelator include derivatized bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine and N, N&prime;-bis-(silylpropyl)-N,N&prime;-bis-(carboxymethyl)ethylene diamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> After attachment of the chelator, a metal ion suitable for binding a histidine-containing protein is bound to the chelator, for example nickel, zinc, cobalt or copper. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The protein can be any protein which contains, either naturally or via manipulation, histidines of a number and arrangement that can bind to the two available cis valencies on the tetracoordinated metal ion linked to the chelating substrate. Naturally occurring proteins of this type include metal-binding proteins such as Helicobacter pylori nickel binding protein (U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,040 issued Jul. 14, 1998 to Plaut et al.). Systems for introducing histidine tags into recombinantly produced proteins are commercially available (Qiagen). Typical histidine tags incorporated into recombinantly produced proteins include 2&times;His, 4&times;His and 6&times;His tags, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,284,933 (issued Feb. 8, 1994 to Dobeli et al.) and 5,310,663 (issued May 10, 1994 to Dobeli et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The protein can be synthetically made, can be recombinantly expressed in a prokaryote, eukaryote, or archeon, or can be purified from a nonrecombinant source. The source from which the protein is obtained may be subjected to various preparative steps to isolate and/or purify the protein prior to binding the protein to the chelating surface; a number of preparative steps are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The protein may have a known or unknown function. The protein can be, for example, a signaling molecule, an enzyme, a light-emitting molecule, a receptor, a signal transduction molecule, an ion channel, an antibody, or a protein identified by genomic sequencing and analysis. Exemplary enzymes include silicateins, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, &bgr;-galactosidase, glucose oxidase, a bacterial luciferase, an insect luciferase and sea pansy luciferase (Renilla koellikeri). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Exemplary light-emitting proteins include &ldquo;green fluorescent protein&rdquo; (GFP), which refers to both native and mutated versions of Aequorea green fluorescent protein that have been identified as exhibiting altered fluorescence characteristics, including altered excitation and emission maxima, as well as excitation and emission spectra of different shapes (Delagrave, S. et al. (1995) Bio/Technology 13:151-154; Heim, R. et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:12501-12504; Heim, R. et al. (1995) Nature 373:663-664). Delgrave et al. isolated mutants of cloned Aequorea victoria GFP that had red-shifted excitation spectra (&ldquo;RFP&rdquo;). Bio/Technology 13:151-154 (1995). Heim, R. et al. reported a mutant (Tyr66 to His) having a blue fluorescence (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1994) USA 91:12501-12504). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Silicateins (silica proteins) are enzymes related to the cathepsin L and papain family of proteases which are involved in the polymerization of silica in marine organisms (Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6234-6238, 1998). Silicateins isolated from the sponge <highlight><italic>Tethya aurantia </italic></highlight>include silicatein alpha, beta and gamma, which form a central protein filament within the sponge spicule. These protein filaments and the individual subunits have been shown to cause the deposition of silica and silicone in vitro when supplied with appropriate substrates (Cha et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:361-365, 1999). The methods taught herein include methods of attaching silicateins to substrates on which they do not naturally occur, and employing the enzymatic activity of the silicateins to deposit silica and/or silicone thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Silicatein alpha, silicatein beta and RFP have separately been recombinantly expressed and used herein in modified form incorporating 6xHis histidine tags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Binding the Protein to the Substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The histidine-containing protein can be bound to the substrate by incubation in solution with the chelating substrate. The methods taught herein for forming and localizing the chelators on the substrate allow a degree of control previously unobtainable for binding and localizing proteins. Patterned deposition of the protein can be controlled by the patterned deposition of any of the components used, for example a material used to activate the surface of the substrate, the substrate modifier, the reagent used to form the chelator, or the protein itself. The activity of the protein can be exhibited, where desired, by subjecting the protein-bound substrate to appropriate conditions for the enzymatic or other activity of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Kits </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Kits comprising reagents useful for performing the methods of the invention are also provided. Typically, a kit comprises: (1) a substrate modifier and (2) a reagent, each of which is retained by a housing. The kit can optionally contain a substrate. Instructions for using the kit to perform a method of the invention are provided with the housing, and may be located inside the housing or outside the housing, and may be printed on the interior or exterior of any surface forming the housing which renders the instructions legible. The kit may be in multiplex form. The substrate may be a microarray. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> 6&times;-His tagged proteins were attached to flat surfaces via sequential growth of an NTA-type linker employing (1) glycidoxyproplytrimethoxysilane, (2) bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine trisodium salt, (3) coordination of Ni2&plus;salts (or Co2&plus; or Cu2&plus;) and finally (4) attachment of the 6&times;-His tagged protein. Pattering the initial silane on the surface of interest permitted subsequent attachment of the proteins in the identical pattern. The bis-carboxymethyl-L-lysine trisodium salt was prepared by first protecting the epsilon amine, the reacting the primary alpha amine with two equivalents of bromoacetic acid, and then forming the trisodium salt from the three carboxyl groups; the epsilon amine is then deprotected and reacted with the gycidyl ether. Two proteins (silicatein alpha and &lsquo;red fluorescent protein&mdash;RFP&rsquo;) were attached in this way to both glass and silicon substrates. The primary question when binding proteins to substrates is the retention of their critical protein properties. This was ensured by observing that, for RFP, red fluorescence (which is folding specific) was still observed after binding to the substrate. In the case of silicatein-alpha, proper folding and function of the protein was demonstrated by observing its catalytic activity of hydrolysis and subsequent polymerization of TEOS to amorphous silica at pH&equals;7. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Previously it was not possible to attach proteins to mesoporous silicas such as the SBA series without functionalizing and derivatizing the silica surfaces after formation. This is due, in part, to the pH of the hydrolysis and condensation reactions (pH&lt;2.0 for SBA mp-SiO2) which would interfere with known protein binding techniques such as NTA chemistry. To this end, we developed a method of incorporating a flexible tetracoordinate complex into mesoporous silica that chelates Ni2&plus; and Co2&plus;metal ions in a similar fashion. Incorporation of the initial active sites during the mesoporous synthesis allows high loading of active sites. The polar nature of these sites directs their presence to the polar surfactant interface and ensures high availability in the final cured mesoporous silica after surfactant removal. The functional mesoporous material was prepared by mixing TEOS with N,N&prime;-bis(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylene diamine under normal mesoporous silica conditions at &lt;pH&equals;2.0. After isolation and extraction of the surfactant by washing, the bridging ethylene diamine groups were reacted with bromoacetic acid to prepare the four-coordinate complex, which subsequently was bound to Ni2&plus;salts. The reaction is depicted on the next page. This complex, integrally attached to the mesoporous silica, was then used to bind 6&times;-His tagged proteins in a fashion analogous to the NTA-type surfaces described in Example 1.
