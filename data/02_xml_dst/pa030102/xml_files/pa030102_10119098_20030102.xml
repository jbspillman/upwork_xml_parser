<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is in the field of mechanical guns and projectors in which the projectile impelling apparatus utilizes a nonexplosive propelling agent. More specifically, the present assembly relates to devices provided with a chamber for containing pressurized gas and include a check valve to admit or release the gas from the chamber to cause the projectile to be positioned in or expelled from a paintball gun. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Paintball&rdquo; is a currently popular recreational sport in which members of opposite teams attempt to mark opponents with paint, thereby removing them from the game. Marking is accomplished by using a paintball marker gun to shoot a projectile (paintball) containing paint or other appropriate marking material at an opponent. Paintballs are spherical capsules filled with paint or other marking material which burst upon impact. Upon contact with a player, the paintball ruptures, thus marking the player. Once a player is marked, he/she is out of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of different types of paintball marker guns exist in the field, using a variety of mechanism for accomplishing their purpose of projecting paintballs. Two of the types of actions used on marker guns are the open bolt action and the closed bolt action. The open bolt type of action is used on simple, relatively inexpensive types of marker. In the open bolt action, the gun body comprises two parallel tubular bores. The upper bore contains the bolt, while the lower bore contains the hammer. The bolt and hammer components are connected together, allowing their moving parts to move in concert. The bolt and hammer assembly is held in the cocked position via a trigger sear, which catches the hammer portion of the assembly. In this position, the breach is open and a paintball is able to drop into position in front of the bolt. When the trigger is pulled, the sear releases the hammer and a spring drives the hammer and bolt forward. As the bolt moves forward, it chambers a paintball into the barrel of the marker gun. Simultaneously, the hammer moves forward to strike a poppet valve as the bolt closes on the chamber. The poppet valve releases a burst of high pressure gas into and through the bolt, expelling the paintball from the barrel. A bleed-off of the burst of high pressure gas then propels the hammer and bolt backwards. The hammer is then caught by the trigger sear, and the marker is again in a cocked configuration and ready to be fired again. This type of action is called an open bolt action because when the marker is in the cocked configuration the bolt is in the open position. Because of its early and inexpensive design, marker guns utilizing the open bolt action represent a significant proportion of the marker guns in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, open bolt action has certain disadvantages. Since the paintball is forcibly moved forward by the bolt milliseconds before the air release to the barrel, the paintball may be damaged by causing distortions in the paintball&apos;s surface. This leads to adverse effects on the paintball&apos;s flight path and decreases accuracy. Another problem occurs when the bolt catches a paintball that is halfway loaded and chops it in half (&ldquo;ball chop&rdquo;). This can coat the barrel with paint, greatly ruining accuracy and potentially jamming the marker. This jamming requires the marker be disassembled for cleaning before continued use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The closed bolt action overcomes these disadvantages. The closed bolt action differs from the open bolt action in that in the closed bolt action, when the marker gun is in the cocked configuration the bolt is in the closed position, and a paintball is already chambered in the barrel. Also, in a closed bolt action, the hammer is no longer connected to nor moves in concert with the bolt. Because when the gun is fired, only the hammer moves, there are fewer inertial forces at play during the actual discharge of the marker. Additionally, the paintball is not impacted by the bolt immediately before it is discharged from the marker gun, and therefore, the paintball should experience less surface distortion. This combination of fewer inertial forces and reduced distortion of the surface of the projectile should improve precision and accuracy of a closed bolt marker over the same marker using an open bolt action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Examples of paintball marker guns used in the field include Anderson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,838 (paintball gun with a passage for porting pressurized gas to a ball projectile); Lukas et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,613,483 (a gas powered gun with a piston and cylinder assembly for ejecting projectiles from the gun) and Lotuaco, III, U.S. Pat. No. 6,065,460 (gas-powered paintball gun with two pressure regulators; one for supplying lower pressure for loading paintballs and one for high pressure for expelling the paintball from the barrel.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Currently, the investment to own even an open bolt action marker gun is substantial. Moving to the next level of marker gun with a closed bolt action, is an even greater expense. Therefore, the field has been motivated to develop means for converting or modifying for a number of purposes, including converting an open bolt action marker gun to closed bolt action type gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One example of a conversion kit is Fusco, U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,137. Fusco describes a conversion kit for converting a pump-action type compressed gas gun to a semi-automatic type compressed gas gun. The kit includes an actuating mechanism, a gas distributing mechanism, and an activating mechanism. The parts are removably connected to the gun, allowing for the gun to be returned to its original configuration upon removal. Another attachment to modify a paintball gun is described by Jones, U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,083. This attachment allows the gun to fire in automatic, semiautomatic or any other pattern of fire. The attachment includes a mechanical mechanism for manipulating a protrusion on the gun, such as the bolt handle, a programmable pulse generator for determining the pattern of fire, and an electromagnetic device for converting signals from the pulse generator into a mechanical motion for driving the mechanical mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it would be beneficial to enable the owner of an open-bolt marker gun to convert the marker to a closed bolt marker, and avoid the expense of having to purchase a new marker gun in order to take advantage of closed bolt action technology. It would be further beneficial if the conversion did not require the structural modification of the original marker gun, so that the marker gun could be returned to its original configuration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a closed bolt action assembly for an existing gas operated paintball marker gun. Typically, a marker gun includes two primary structural components: the receiver (or marker gun body) and the trigger group (or marker gun frame). The present closed bolt action assembly can be used in the production of new units of the existing paintball marker gun or it can be used to replace the action assembly in a prior production unit. A paintball marker gun typically is made up of two major structural components: a marker gun body and a frame. Existing paintball marker guns that comprised body and frame combinations that were compatible with the present invention without structural modification of the body or frame include: the KINGMAN SPYDER&trade;, and AVALON&apos;s GT COMMANDO. Other existing marker guns with which the present invention is intended to be compatible include the REBEL&trade; by 32DEGREES; PMI&apos;s PIRANHA, NPS&apos;s GT2000, and VIEWLOADER&apos;s GENESIS. It is anticipated that the present invention will be generally compatible with any paintball marker gun having receiver and frame structural characteristics analogous to these marker guns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present closed bolt action assembly comprises a combination bolt and hammer assembly, an actuator assembly and a pressure control assembly. The bolt and hammer assembly is releaseably containable in the marker gun body. The marker body is a pair of parallel cylindrical tubes integrally fixed together along a length of their outer surfaces. The marker body in turn is mounted on the marker gun frame in an &ldquo;over and under&rdquo; configuration. The actuator assembly is disposed in the marker gun trigger group or frame in mechanical communication with the bolt and hammer assembly. The actuator assembly releaseably holds the bolt and hammer assembly in a cocked configuration prior to discharge of the marker gun. The actuator assembly includes the trigger for the gun. The pressure control assembly is in mechanical communication with the actuator assembly and in gas flow communication with the bolt and hammer assembly. The pressure control assembly controls low pressure gas flows to drive certain operations of the bolt and hammer assembly, such as opening and closing the bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The bolt and hammer assembly comprises separate bolt and hammer components which operate independently of each other when they are installed in the marker body. The bolt is installed in the upper or &ldquo;over&rdquo; tube of the marker gun body, and the hammer is installed in the lower or &ldquo;under&rdquo; tube. The bolt opens the breech of the marker gun allowing a paintball projectile to be loaded into the marker gun. The bolt then closes the breech and chambers the projectile into the barrel of the marker gun. The operation of the bolt is controlled by the low pressure gas controller assembly. The action of the hammer operates a high pressure gas valve to open a high pressure gas flow path between a source of high pressure gas and the chamber of the barrel. A portion of the high pressure gas flow path is through the bolt head of the bolt when the bolt is in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The bolt of the bolt and hammer assembly is further comprises an air ram, mounting means, a bolt head and low pressure gas lines. The air ram is pneumatic cylinder housing a double action piston. The piston is double action in that it can be driven in two directions. A piston shaft is attached to the piston and protrudes from one end of the pneumatic cylinder of the air ram. The piston shaft is driven by movement of the piston within the air ram cylinder. The other end of the pneumatic cylinder is attached to an air ram mounting block. The ram mounting block in turn is received into the over tube of the gun body proximate its breech end, and retained there by a locking pin. Two low pressure gas ports are disposed on the air ram in communication with an interior space of the pneumatic cylinder, one each for driving the piston in either direction. At the front end of the air ram, a bolt head is attached to the protruding end of the piston shaft. The term &ldquo;front&rdquo; as used herein regarding a structure or component refers to that portion of the thing most proximate the muzzle of the barrel of the marker gun in which it is installed. The bolt head is driven by movement of the piston within the pneumatic cylinder of the air ram. Additionally, a bolt sealing disk is disposed proximate the front end of the ram. The sealing disk provides stability to the front end of the air ram and pneumatic isolation of the bolt head from the rest of the bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The bolt head is substantially a cylinder having a central axis, a solid circumferential surface. The front end of the bolt head is the bolt-face end. The bolt face is typically concave to compliment the shape of the paintball projectile. The back end of the bolt head engages the piston shaft end of the air ram. An inside-mating surface is provided along at least a portion of the central axis at the back end of the bolt head to receive the piston shaft end. A plurality of gas flow passages are disposed in the bolt head, passing through the bolt-face and breech ends of the bolt head. The passages are a portion of the high pressure gas pathway that supplies propellant to project a chambered paintball from the barrel of the marker gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The ram mounting block is substantially cylindrical and is closely received into the lumen of the over tube of the marker body when installed. The ram block has a longitudinal tab along at least part of its outer surface in parallel with the axis of the cylinder of the ram block. On installation of the bolt, the tab is received into a portion of a slot in the rear or breech end of the marker body, which slot is open to the interior space or lumen of both the over and under tubes of the marker body. The ram block tab incorporates a complementary part of a detent by which the bolt and hammer assembly is retained in position in the marker body after its installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hammer assembly of the present invention also has a generally cylindrical configuration and comprises a cylindrical striker in axial alignment with a cylindrical tensioner block and a bias spring disposed along the axis between the striker and the tensioner block. The bias spring functions to axially separate the striker from the tensioner block. The striker has solid front face for impacting a high pressure gas flow control valve to cause the valve to open. The rear end of the striker has a coaxial lumen along a portion of its axis for receiving one end of the bias spring. The front face of the tensioner block has a coaxial lumen along a portion of its axis for receiving the bias spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A detent complimentary to the detent on the tab of the ram block defines the upper surface of the tensioner block. A locking pin passing through the marker body and simultaneously engaging the detents on both the ram block and the tensioner block retains the bolt and hammer in the marker body. Additionally, the tensioner block has a pre-loading means for adjusting the normal bias of the bias spring. Typically this is accomplished by having an adjusting screw pass through the axis of the tensioner block from its rear surface to impinge on the end of the bias spring received in the lumen of the block. Turning the screw alters the normal length of the bias spring and hence the initial bias load or force exerted by the bias spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Cocking the marker gun causes the striker to be drawn toward the tensioner block against the force of the bias spring. Cocking the marker gun is manually accomplished by drawing the cocking rod to its fully extended position. When the striker has been drawn a distance toward the tensioner block to store sufficient energy in the bias spring, a trigger notch on the lower surface of the striker engages a sear lever on the marker gun frame and is retained at this position inside the under tube. In this configuration, the hammer of the marker gun is cocked. Upon operation of the sear lever to disengage it from the trigger notch, the striker flies forward under the force of the bias spring and impacts the high pressure gas flow valve (e.g., a poppet valve) causing it to operate and open a high pressure gas flow path to the over tube. Once the high pressure valve is operated, a bleed off pressure from the high pressure gas flow path to the lumen of the under tube in front of the striker causes the striker to be drawn back again against the force of the bias spring until the hammer is again cocked. This is how the hammer is automatically cocked after the marker gun is discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, before the action is able to automatically re-cock the marker gun after being discharged, it must be manually cocked before the first time it is discharged. This is accomplished by operation of a manual cocking rod. The manual cocking rod is a metal rod having two ends. The front end of the cocking rod freely passes through a hammer link pin mounted to the top surface of the striker. The front end of the cocking rod has a stop at its terminus to prevent its being withdrawn from and for engaging the link pin. The link pin not only serves to couple the cocking rod to the striker, but also serves to maintain the striker in the proper orientation, so that the trigger notch is always bottom most on the striker. The length of the cocking rod slidably passes through the air ram mounting block, parallel to the axis of both the over and the under tubes. The rear end of the cocking rod extends outside the marker body and is adapted to be manually gripped and withdrawn from the marker body to place the hammer of the bolt and hammer assembly in a cocked configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the cocking rod may be completely integrated into the hammer assembly. In this embodiment, the cocking rod does not engage the link pin, but rather, is disposed to engage a striker insert received in the bore of the striker/hammer. The cocking rod then extends from the marker gun by passing through the tensioner block rather than the air mounting ram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The actuator assembly is installed in the marker gun trigger group or frame as part of the discharging mechanism of the marker gun. The actuator assembly comprises the trigger of the marker gun, which when the present invention is installed, is in direct mechanical communication with the pressure control assembly, and with the means for releaseably holding the bolt and hammer assembly in a cocked configuration (the trigger sear lever). The actuator mechanism includes a link rod which mechanically connects the trigger to the pressure control assembly. Alternatively, the actuator assembly has been practiced using a slide switch to mechanically connect the trigger to the pressure control assembly, instead of the link rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The pressure control assembly is in part installed on the marker gun frame and in part on the marker body. The pressure control assembly comprises a slide operated, two-way, low pressure gas valve in direct mechanical communication with the trigger of the actuator assembly. The low pressure gas valve is mounted to the marker frame using a mounting bracket or a stand-off. Three low pressure gas lines are connected to the low pressure valve. The other end of the incoming or primary gas line is connected to a low pressure gas regulator which provides low pressure gas for the gas pressure control assembly. In turn, the low pressure gas regulator is connected to the marker gun body in gas flow communication with the high pressure gas source of the marker gun. The low pressure gas regulator is adjustable to regulate an amount of reduction of gas pressure accomplished by the regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The other two low pressure gas line are connected to the outputs of the low pressure valve. These are the first and second secondary gas lines. At its other end, the first secondary gas line is connected in gas flow communication with the piston return port on the air ram, and the second secondary gas line is connected in a similar manner in gas flow communication with the piston extension port on the air ram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be used to convert an existing paintball marker gun from an open bolt action to a closed bolt action. The process for accomplishing this comprising the steps of removing the existing bolt and hammer assembly from the marker gun and installing the present combination bolt and hammer assembly in the marker gun in it place. Replacing the existing trigger of the marker gun with the present actuator assembly, and installing the pressure control assembly on the marker gun, connecting the pressure control assembly to the actuator assembly and to the bolt and hammer assembly to provide a paintball marker gun having a closed bolt action. This conversion is accomplished without modification of the existing marker gun body or frame. The present invention is provided as a kit to facilitate a user&apos;s converting an open bolt action paintball marker gun to a closed bolt action. The kit includes the closed bolt action assembly described herein, instructions and container or package for containing the closed bolt action assembly and the instructions. </paragraph>

The receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and any attachments are mounted on the trigger group or frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a vertical orientation with the over bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> uppermost. The marker gun trigger group attaches to the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by way of fasteners <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is in mechanical communication with the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by way of the trigger sear lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The present open bolt action assembly itself comprises a combination bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an actuator assembly <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a pressure control assembly <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 2</cross-reference>A, the bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises two major subassemblies: a bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> subassembly and a hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> subassembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is removably installed in the marker gun receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> installed in the lumen of upper or &ldquo;over&rdquo; bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> installed in the lumen of the lower or &ldquo;under&rdquo; bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The action of the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provides for opening and closing the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to automatically load a paintball projectile <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from an attached magazine <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> then chambers the projectile <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is comprised of a bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and an air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an air ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> housing a double action piston <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of which protrudes from the first or front end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is connected to the front end of the piston shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> fixedly receives the second or rear end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and releaseably retains the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the marker body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Two low pressure gas cylinder ports <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are disposed in communication with the interior space of the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to deliver low pressure gas proximate each end of the ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A bolt sealing disk <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is disposed proximate the front end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The sealing disk <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> provides structural stability to the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and pneumatic isolation of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> within the over bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the sealing disk <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> utilized an &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> retained about the circumference of the disk <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to accomplish its sealing feature. Other means of accomplishing the sealing feature of the disk <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and are practicable in the present invention. The air rams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> practiced in the preferred embodiment were commercially acquired from ANS and J&amp;J. These vendors and/or other for certain component parts of the present invention are known to the ordinary skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In operating the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, when low pressure gas is applied to the rear cylinder port <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is moved toward the front end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. This action extends the shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the attached bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> forward into the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and against the chamber of the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A paintball projectile <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> positioned in the breech before this action is moved forward by the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and chambered into the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. With the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in this position, the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is sealed and the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the closed configuration. The bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is held closed in the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> during firing by the pressure differential across the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, since the highest gas pressure during firing initially occurs at the rear of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and expands through it into the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When low pressure gas is applied to the front cylinder port <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is moved toward the rear end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. This action retracts the shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> into the pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and withdraws the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> away from the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and backward past the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. With the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in this position, the breech <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is opened and the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the opened configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is cylindrical, having a central axis and a solid circumferential surface. The front end of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is the bolt-face <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the bolt face <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is contoured to at least partially complement the shape of the projectile <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> it loads into the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). The ram end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has an inside-mating surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> along at least a portion of the central axis of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, for receiving and attaching to the piston shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Preferable, the mating surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is threaded and disposed to engage a complementary thread on the front end <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the piston shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A plurality of gas flow passages <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> pass through the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> communicating between the bolt-face <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and ram end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is substantially cylindrical and is closely received into the lumen of the over tube bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when installed. The ram block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal tab <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in parallel with the axis of the block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and extending radially from its outer surface. On installation of the bolt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the tab <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is received into a portion of the receiver slot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the rear or breech end of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The receiver slot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is open to the interior space or lumen of both the over and under bores <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the marker body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The ram block tab <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> incorporates a complementary part of the detent <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> by which the bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is retained in position in the marker receiver (marker body) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> after its installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The hammer subassembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> functions to operate the high pressure gas valve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to open the high pressure gas flow passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between the high pressure gas chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, through the bolt head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to the barrel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is comprised of a cylindrical striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in axial alignment with a cylindrical tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is disposed in axial alignment between striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the tensioner <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. When the hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is retained in place in the under tube bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the tensioner block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is fixed in place and the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is slidable within the under tube bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The bias of the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> acts to axially separate the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> away from the tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has an impact face <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a rear face <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The striker also has a coaxial lumen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> open at its rear face <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and extending along a portion of its axis for receiving the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a tensioner front face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a tensioner rear face <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, with a coaxial lumen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> open at its front face <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and extending along a portion of its axis for receiving the bias spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a pre-loading means <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (velocity adjustment screw) for adjusting the bias or force the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> exerts on the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the tensioner <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> had a threaded aperture <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which received a complementary threaded adjusting screw <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extended through the aperture <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The front screw end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> impinged on the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> received in the tensioner lumen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The rear screw end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> was slotted as a manual manipulating means for altering the distance the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extended into the tensioner lumen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to pre-load the bias of the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Other means of accomplishing a manipulating means are known to the ordinary skilled artisan that are practicable in the present invention, such as knurled screws and winged screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a detent <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> complimentary to the detent <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on the tab <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the ram block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. A locking cross pin <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> passes through a pin aperture <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> in the marker receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and simultaneously engaging the detents <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> on both the ram block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to retain the bolt and hammer in the marker body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is cylindrical, in a preferred embodiment its axial orientation within the under bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was fixed. In that preferred embodiment, the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> had a trigger sear notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in a portion of its outer surface. The trigger notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> engaged the trigger sear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the marker gun frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and retained it at this position inside the under tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In that configuration, the hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was cocked. The trigger notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> was maintained in a downward most position relative to the position of the over bore <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by means of a link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> which protruded from the outer surface of the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> opposite the trigger notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a means of manually cocking the hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to initiate the automatic cycling of the present closed bolt action. This was accomplished in a preferred embodiment, wherein the link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> was in operative communication with a manual cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The manual cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> slidably passed through the ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, parallel to the air ram <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> had its first or front end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> inside the marker body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in mechanical communication with the link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cocking rod front end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> has a stop means <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> at its terminus to engage the link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> when the cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is manually operated, but to disengage the link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> when the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is itself otherwise moved. The link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> not only serves to couple the cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, but also serves to maintain the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the proper orientation the under bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that the trigger notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is always bottom most on the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The second or rear end <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the cocking rod <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> extended through the ram block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and outside the marker receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The second or rear cocking rod end <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> was adapted to be manually gripped and withdrawn from the marker receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to place hammer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the bolt and hammer assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a cocked configuration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a rear view of the air ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the hammer tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> showing the over and under relationship of the two components as installed in the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be completely integral to the hammer assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, i.e., the cocking rod disposed completely as part of the hammer assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not engage the link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or any portion of the bolt assembly, but rather, is disposed to engage a striker insert tube <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> received in the lumen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>then extends from the marker gun receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by passing through the tensioner mount <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and velocity adjuster <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>rather than the air ram mounting block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The striker insert tube <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> moves in unison with the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment shown, a friction link provided by the O-ring <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> connects the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and striker insert tube <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> allowing them to move in unison in the under bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and insert tube <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> combination travel forward and backward in the under bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as such when the marker gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is being fired, the striker insert <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> slides freely over the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Preferably, the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>remains stationary during firing. When the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in a forward position (i.e., the hammer spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is in an extended or uncompressed configuration), and the gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> needs to be manually cocked (i.e, the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> brought to the back position so that the trigger notch <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may engage the trigger sear <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>), the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is moved backwards by pulling backwards on the cocking knob <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> attached to the cocking rod rear end <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. This draws the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through central bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in the thrust plate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and velocity adjuster <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which each have holes through them allowing the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to slide semi-freely through them. The resistance to movement encountered by the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>passing through these bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> &amp; <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is not sufficient to hinder manually cocking gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but is sufficient to prevent the movement of the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>upon the automatic cocking of the gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is drawn backwards, the cocking rod stop <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>shown in this embodiment as an enlargement at the cocking rod front end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> (which usually slides freely inside the striker insert <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), engages the rod seat <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the striker insert <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the rod seat <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is a reduced internal diameter of the back end of the striker insert tube <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. This allows the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> combination to be drawn backwards by the cocking rod <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The link pin <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>maintains the axial orientation of the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and prevents it from rotating in the under bore <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Also illustrated in this embodiment is a bumper pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which may be incorporated into a hammer assembly to cushion or reduce the recoil of the striker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the end of its backward travel The bumper pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> was made of a rubber type material in the embodiment shown, but any other suitable materials as selectable by one of skill in the art may be used. The cocking knob <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> is illustrated as attached to the cocking rod rear end <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> by means of a set screw <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. However, alternative mean for providing a cocking knob <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> at the cocking rod rear end <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are known to the ordinary skilled artisan and are readily accomplishable in the present invention.
