<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A continuously variable transmission has dual driving connections extending between a first shaft and a second shaft. The driving connections generally include a drive pulley, a driven pulley and a belt. The pulleys each comprise a fixed portion and an axially moveable portion. Movement between the two portions changes an effective diameter of the pulley. The moveable portions of the drive pulley are positioned next to one another on the first shaft and the moveable portions are interposed between the fixed portions of the drive pulleys. The fixed portions of the driven pulleys, on the other hand, are interposed between the moveable portions. The driven pulleys are free to rotate relative to the second shaft. A differential is positioned between the fixed portions of the driven pulleys, connects the two fixed portions and transfers the torque from the driven pulleys to the second shaft. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to continuously variable transmissions. More specifically, the present invention is related to dual drive continuously variable transmissions having dual drives slaved together for transfer of torque from input shafts to output shafts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Continuously variable transmissions (&ldquo;CVTs&rdquo;) are a type of transmission capable of transferring torque from an input shaft to an output shaft. The CVT allows the speed change to occur within the transmission while the input speed is maintained at a substantially constant rotational velocity. Thus, the CVT is a transmission that is capable of converting input speeds into output speeds that are steplessly variable within a given range. Recently, these transmissions have been used in the automotive industry for transferring torque between an input shaft and an output shaft of a vehicle employing a low horsepower engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The most common of such CVT drives for automobiles has used a steel segmented V-belt operating with axially moveable steel pulleys that force belt radial movement along the conical pulley surfaces to change the speed ratio between the driven and the output shaft, usually by a combination of springs and hydraulic generated force. Such belts operate the drive by transferring the torque from an input shaft, through a single input pulley, to a single output pulley and, ultimately, to an output shaft. Drives of this type have been successful and, as mentioned above, are currently being commercially produced in the lower horsepower range of passenger automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Operational qualities of CVT drives are well known in the automotive industry, including their shortcomings. Continuous research and development effort is being expended in the automobile industry to extend the capabilities of the belt and pulley basic concept because of the perceived advantages to be realized over more traditional transmissions now in production. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One of the shortcomings of some current CVT drives includes limitations on operation in the higher horsepower range, the solving of which is the genesis of this invention. Thus, the present invention was designed to handle increased horsepower over single belt CVT systems. Specifically, a dual belt CVT system was created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The creation of a dual belt CVT system, however, revealed other drawbacks. Included among these drawbacks where the complication of system construction and increased size and cost, as well as loss of the prime mover energy due to what is termed bucking of the belts against each other. The bucking of the belts occurs, for instance, when the operation of a dual drive system is not synchronous. The difficulty is further magnified when such a system must be continuously variable and automatically controlled as is required in an automotive application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention involves coupling two CVT belt systems operating in parallel. Thus, each of the CVT belt systems absorbs half the input torque of the input shaft and delivers it to the output shaft. The torque transfer occurs in the present invention with very low power loss due to an advantageously coupling of components and synchronous driving of the belt systems. Similar to some single belt systems in use, the present invention changes the pulley ratios using selective pressurization of the pulleys. Specifically, each pulley includes a biased portion that, when pressurized, alters the effective diameter of the pulley. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Because two parallel continuously variable drives, which are positioned on common shafts, may not naturally operate synchronously in the serial production world, three additional elements can be employed singularly or together to accomplish the necessary compatibility without excessive energy loss or undue complication. One such element is a device, hydraulic or mechanical, to precisely and synchronously, control the moveable halves of the drive pulleys positions to maintain an even operating radius or effective diameter of the belts on the pulleys during hydraulic pressure application for ratio changing or holding in between travel extremes. Another element is precise pulley groove width control employing accurate parts dimensions axially where the pulleys meet stops at the extremes of travel to essentially position each belt at like operating radii, or effective diameters, in both the high gear or cruise position and the low gear position, which are the positions at which the CVT will operate most of the time. The third element incorporates a differential gear set with very low friction performance. Preferably, the differential gear is installed between the two driven pulleys on the output shaft. This third element accommodates differences in output rotational speed of the output pulleys regardless of the implementation of the above-two elements. The differential therefore will accept the torque of each pulley separately even though there is a speed disparity and apply this torque to the output gear or sprocket, through the so-called spider gears of the differential, with minimal energy loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a CVT system in a compact arrangement. The system should be capable of handling increased horsepower and should be mechanically producible using conventional materials and processes at reasonable cost. The present invention, therefore, has been engineered in a generic form that may be readily tailored to a specific application. However, it is envisioned that the present invention will have particular utility in the automotive industry, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A dual belt and pulley system arranged and configured in accordance with the present invention can easily be understood by one familiar with the much used single system. It can be seen that the present system, incorporating a unique, compact mechanical arrangement of the elements necessary to ensure the compatibility of side-by-side operation very simply makes possible the doubling of the torque capacity of any such single system. The use of this practical concept today does not require &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; development of the single belt and pulley design per se but whatever such advances may come to pass in the future, their capability can also be doubled. It should also be noted that the drive shaft, as explained herein, can become the driven shaft without modifications other than installation considerations of packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves a continuously variable transmission comprising an input shaft. The input shaft supporting two input pulleys and the two input pulleys each comprising a fixed disk portion and a moveable disk portion. Axial movement of the moveable disk portion along the input shaft relative to the fixed disk portion changes an effective diameter of the pulley. The moveable disk portions of the two input pulleys are interposed along the input shaft between the fixed disk portions of the two input pulleys and a synchronizing member connects the two moveable disk portions such that the effective diameters of the two input pulleys are maintained as substantially equal by the synchronizing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention involves a continuously variable transmission. The transmission comprises a first belt assembly and second belt assembly that extend between a torque transmitting shaft and a torque receiving shaft. The first belt assembly comprises a first drive pulley, a first driven pulley and a first belt while the second belt assembly comprises a second drive pulley, a second driven pulley and a second belt. The first drive pulley and the second drive pulley each comprise a moveable drive sheave portion and a fixed drive sheave portion. The moveable drive sheave portions are capable of movement along an axis of the torque transmitting shaft. The first driven pulley and the second driven pulley each comprise a fixed driven sheave portion and a moveable driven sheave portion. The moveable driven sheave portion is capable of movement along an axis of the torque receiving shaft. The moveable drive sheave portions are connected by a mechanical linkage to equalize the movement along the axis of the torque transmitting shaft between the first drive pulley and the second drive pulley. A differential connects the fixed driven sheave portions to the torque receiving shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention involves an axially expandable pulley arrangement comprising a first pulley disk and a second pulley disk. The first disk comprises a first front face, a first back face and a first hub while the second disk comprises a second front face, a second back face and a second hub. The second hub extends at least partially within the first hub and the first back face includes a circumferential flange. A piston is positioned within the flange and is slidablyconnected to the first back face. The piston also is connected to the second hub through an aperture defined in the first hub such that movement of the piston relative to the first pulley disk results in corresponding movement of the second pulley disk relative to the first pulley disk. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> continuously variable transmission configured and arranged in accordance with the present invention is illustrated therein. The transmission, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, has particular utility in the automotive industry. More specifically, the present transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has particular utility in transferring torque from an output shaft of an engine to a propulsion shaft in applications having engines operating within higher power bands of horsepower. Of course, the present transmission may also find utility in a wide range of other applications, which applications will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the illustrated transmission generally comprises a pair of drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are mounted to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are configured with a stationary portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a moveable portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, each of the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> drive a belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in turn, drives a corresponding driven pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Thus, the torque from the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is transferred to an output shaft or drive shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through the belts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Both the drive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and driven shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are illustrated as hollow and may accept co-axial drive means, if desired The belts are preferably a commercially available, steel segmented type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned to the outsides of the transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> such that the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are interposed between the two stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are preferably rotationally keyed to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in addition to being interference fit to the shaft. Such a mounting arrangement advantageously secures the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for coupled rotational movement while the mounting arrangement limits the axial moveability of the pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> relative to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are preferably heated and interference fit to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, with reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> woodruff key <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably used to reinforce the coupling between the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Of course, other mounting arrangements may become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably slidably keyed to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a set of key balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a corresponding set of axial ball races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed along the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the interaction of which will be described in detail below. The moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have hubs <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are generally configured to slide along the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a pocket formed inside of a portion of the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (i.e., within the pulley hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). It should be appreciated that the moveable pulley hub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is sized to contact a face of the pocket formed inside the stationary pulley hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In this manner, the face of the pocket and the end of the moveable pulley hub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>form a positive stop for movement of the moveable pulley <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> toward the stationary pulley <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A seal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is positioned proximate a disk portion of each moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The seals <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> advantageously substantially seal the interface between the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and each moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A seal <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is also positioned proximate a disk portion of each stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. These seals <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> advantageously substantially seal the sliding interface between the two pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, the seals <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can reduce leakage of fluid used to generate hydraulic pressure, which is used to at least partially control relative positioning between the pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is slidably connected to each illustrated stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. While the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed independently of one another in the illustrated transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it is anticipated that the two components may be formed of a single member. The illustrated pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are preferably fixed to the moveable pulley halves for axial movement relative to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, it is apparent that in some arrangements, the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may form positive stops with the back face <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that movement of the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a direction away from the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are preferably fixed to the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The illustrated pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with snap rings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is in contact with an inner face of the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in cooperation with the snap rings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, fix a relative positioning of the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The spring load bears against the back faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and pushes the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> away from the back faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>A seal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is also preferably positioned between each sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and each stationary hub <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In addition, the hydraulically-actuated pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably sealed with o-rings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at the cylinder walls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which are integrally formed with the stationary pulleys <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the illustrated transmission. Thus, the interface between both the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the stationary hubs <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the stationary pulley <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are substantially sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are attached to the moveable pulley half hubs <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by a set of bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in a corresponding set of slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the stationary pulley half hubs <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the illustrated arrangement are recessed or countersunk to reduce the likelihood of interference between the bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the moveable pulley halves and the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are attached together in three locations, which are approximately 120 degrees apart about the circumference of the hubs <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>As illustrated, this arrangement results in the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being fixed together for axial movement relative to the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also, in some arrangements, the slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be sized and configured to form positive stops on the allowable relative axial travel. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, one of the bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that connects the sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the moveable pulley halves of the drive pulleys is illustrated in a high gear position (i.e., that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In transition to a low gear position (i.e., that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the bolt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will move to the opposite end of the slot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provided in the shank of the stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The illustrated arrangement also causes the moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be coupled for rotation with the stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> relative to an axis of rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The two drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are positioned with belts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the smallest working diameter where the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are axially moveable on the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, have been forced apart against the loadings of the springs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the two drive pulleys in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are illustrated in a position in which the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> have been driven together under hydraulic forces exerted within piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) defined by the pistons <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Specifically, as the pressure within the piston chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> increases, the volume of the piston chamber is forced to increase. Because the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are fixed relative to the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the slidable piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves outward (i.e., away from the stationary pulley half). The outward motion of the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the set of bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The outward motion therefore draws the two pulley halves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are preferably dynamically keyed to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the use of a ball and elongated axial ball race arrangement. Specifically, the generally cylindrical elongated axial ball races are formed partially along an outer surface of the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and partially along an inner surface of the hub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Thus, when the outer surface of the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the hub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are brought together and properly aligned, the generally cylindrical elongated axial ball races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the circumferential relationship of the ball grooves or races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the bolts <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that connect the spring loaded sleeves <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the moveable pulley shafts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is illustrated therein. Preferably, for rotational balance and other inertial reasons, the races are positioned equally about the circumference of the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and hub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>More preferably, three races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are used and the three races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are interposed by the three fasteners <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and slots <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may have a tapered configuration in transmissions formed with circular cutting tools (i.e., horizontal mills, etc.) Due to the tapered configuration, circular wire rings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are preferably installed in grooves around both shafts as shown. The wire rings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> advantageously function as ball stops to prevent the balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from jamming in the tapered groove extremities. As illustrated, at least three balls are preferably used; however, depending upon the radial and torsional loading of the shaft, more or less balls may also be used. Preferably, the length of the races <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the positioning of the wire rings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be adjusted accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, an articulating mechanism or member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which preferably extends between the two moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, enforces substantially equal and generally synchronous relative movement of the pulley faces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the extremes of travel. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, the illustrated articulating member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> generally comprises a pair of beams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which are slidably inserted into a corresponding pair of crossbars <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The crossbars <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably are inserted through rectangular anchor pieces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that are bolted by bolts <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to inner faces <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The crossbars <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are capable of rotation about a rotational axis A such that the beams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can pivot about a pivot axis P defined through a center bolt <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The illustrated center bolt is threaded securely to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and positions a bearing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> around which the beams pivot when there is movement of the pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> axially along the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bearing is preferably a roller bearing; however, any bearing configuration, including, taper, ball, and needle, may also be used. Moreover, the bearing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a bushing. The bushing should be a non-galling material such as brass or plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the bearing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> preferably secures the articulating beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in position with a shoulder. As illustrated, the bearing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is preferably securing by a locking tab <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The locking tab <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> includes a short dog leg <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which is inserted into a shallow slot <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. After the bolt <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is tightened into position, a corner <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of the locking tab <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is bent upwards against the bolt <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to the lock the bolt against undesirable rotation. Of course, other suitable mounting arrangements for the articulating beam and the bearing assembly may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, as the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> move to a substantially closed position, such as that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the beams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allow only substantially equal movement of each pulley half relative to the pivot axis P. As the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> move to a substantially open position, such as the depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the beams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> again only allow substantially equal movement of each pulley half <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> relative to the pivot axis P. Moreover, because the beams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are connected to both the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inner faces <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the pulley halves <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the two pulley halves are further coupled for substantially synchronous rotational movement about an axis of drive shaft rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pair of driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are carried by an output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receive torque from the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the drive belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similar to the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the driven pulleys generally comprise moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the illustrated driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned as the inside halves. This relative positioning is desirable in order to allow the belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to better track between the two pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Moreover, because the moveable portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the drive pulley <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are positioned to the inside for efficient slaving together, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are better arranged to the inside on the driven pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are supported by the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>; however, the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are preferably not keyed, splined or otherwise affixed to the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> such that the pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> must rotate with the shaft without the use of an outside connection. While the pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be fixed for rotation with the shaft in some applications, the present transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> uses a differential <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which will be described below, to transfer the rotation of the pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the driven shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and hubs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>preferably also are not axially moveable on the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and are restrained from movement at the outer extremities by needle type thrust bearings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The thrust bearings also absorb or counter axial thrusts along the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which may be set up by components of the differential <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of each driven pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are preferably slidably keyed together. As discussed above, this dynamic torsion coupling, or dynamic keying, is accomplished by the balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are positioned in axial ball races <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and races <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are preferably formed between an outside surface of the extended hubs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stationary pulley halves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and an inside surface of the hubs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Also, preferably a needle bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is interposed between the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of each stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the needle bearing <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is positioned proximate the loading position along the shaft, which loading position is the point at which the belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pulls on the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a direction generally normal to the axis of shaft rotation. In addition, as with the drive pulleys <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, seals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned between components that are axially moveable relative to one another (i.e., moveable pulley half <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the driven pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> advantageously forms the piston chamber <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> without the need for a piston sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This is because the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the driven pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does not translate relative to a hub. Instead, the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are moved by pressure changes within the piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Also, as discussed above, the springs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are also positioned within the piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, at the driven or output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are illustrated with the belts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at an enlarged working diameter. The enlarged diameter is formed when the moveable pulley halves <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which are axially movably on the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, have been forced inwardly by the springs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the decreased hydraulic pressure within the piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, the driven pulley piston chamber pressure and the drive pulley piston chamber pressure control the movement of the pulleys together because the belt ideally will not stretch any substantial amount; however, this unbalanced force is typically effective to change the belt position (i.e., along the relative diameters) while the shafts are rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, each stationary pulley half <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> incorporates a bevel gear <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on its hub <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The bevel gears <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are preferably centrally located around the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and form a portion of the differential <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Thus, the bevel gears <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> preferably face each other and mesh with additional bevel gears <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, sometimes called spider gears. The spider gears <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotate on stub shafts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that are preferably an integral part of a gear hub or sprocket connector to the output or driven shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. During operation of the transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is driven by the two pulley assembly bevel gears <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> bearing against the spider gears <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If there is a difference in the speeds of the driven pulley assemblies, the spider gears <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will rotate on the stub shafts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to accept the different speeds while the differential <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> continues transferring the output torque of each to the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. If desired, an output can be taken from the alternate gear or chain drive <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> partially shown attached to the driven shaft in the same plane as the spider gears. To keep power losses to a minimum during the torque transfer with uneven pulley speeds, thrust and radial needle bearings, such as those shown, may be incorporated into the differential at loading points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The pistons, cylinders and springs shown on both shaft assemblies are essentially the same in size and operation. The springs bias the moveable pulley halves to close the belt gap and the hydraulically operated pistons add to the spring force when selectively pressurized. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the unit in the low gear or start mode and as rotation takes place, at some point the hydraulic control system (not part of this invention) will sense the need to change the position of the belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the pulleys to an intermediate ratio as the vehicle accelerates from a stop. A higher hydraulic pressure then will be introduced to the piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> than that at the piston chambers <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the driven shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (porting not shown). Given enough difference in pressure, the belt gap on the drive side will start to close and the belts will climb the faces to a larger radius of operation. Since the belts cannot stretch, they are pulled deeper into the gaps of the driven pulleys <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> forcing the gaps to widen and compress the springs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If the higher pressure continues at the drive shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> end the drive ratio will reach its highest point for cruise as is shown referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. To move the ratio back to the low gear or start position, the higher pressure is applied to the cylinders <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the driven shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to reverse the procedure, or it can be modulated somewhere in between by selectively changing the hydraulic pressure to the cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic control pressure preferably enters each shaft interior through the fittings and mechanical shaft seals shown on each shaft from a source not shown and enters and exits the cylinders through ports provided. Advantageously, some hydraulic leakage can occur through the joints and along the shafts the way the assembly is shown, which leakage is intended to keep the bearings and sliding fits fully lubricated. It is anticipated, however, that further partial sealing can be accomplished given the need. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is illustrated after being installed in the case or housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as viewed from the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown forms a suitable enclosure for the illustrated transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The illustrated case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> features a bolt circle attachment geometry at the drive end. The bolt circle attachment preferably would support the attachment of the case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the transmission <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to a power source. Moreover, the output shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> position and the hydraulic fitting port for control hydraulics the driving shaft are illustrated. Of course, many other case <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> structures may also occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in terms of a certain embodiment, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art also are within the scope of this invention. Thus, various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For instance, various components may be repositioned as desired. In addition, while the illustrated transmission uses two separate hydraulic chambers (i.e., piston chambers), it is anticipated that movement of a single moveable pulley half may be used to cause the movement in the other moveable pulley half. Moreover, not all of the features, aspects and advantages are necessarily required to practice the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is intended to be defined only by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
