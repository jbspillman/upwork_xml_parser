<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to promoting adhesion between golf ball layers. In particular, this invention relates to the use of silane coupling agents to promote adhesion between layers of a golf ball cores, intermediate layers, and cover layers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional golf balls can be divided into two general classes: solid and wound. Solid golf balls include one-piece, two-piece (i.e., solid core and a cover), and multi-layer (i.e., solid core of one or more layers and/or a cover of one or more layers) golf balls. Wound golf balls typically include a solid, hollow, or fluid-filled center, surrounded by a tensioned elastomeric material, and a cover. Solid balls have traditionally been considered longer and more durable than wound balls, but also lack the preferred &ldquo;feel&rdquo; provided by the wound construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By altering ball construction and composition, manufacturers can vary a wide range of playing characteristics, such as compression, velocity, &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; and spin, each of which can be optimized for various playing abilities. In particular, a variety of core and cover layer(s) constructions, such as multi-layer balls having dual cover layers and/or dual core layers, have been investigated. These golf ball layers are typically constructed with a number of polymeric compositions and blends, including polybutadiene rubber, polyurethanes, polyamides, and ethylene-based ionomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One problem sometimes encountered by manufacturers when attempting to construct multi-layered golf balls, however, is improper adhesion between layers. This problem arises when the compositions of adjacent layers are chemically incompatible, even if only by a small amount, or when processing conditions required for a particular layer are inconsistent with those required for an adjacent layer. Therefore, a need exists for development of a better adhesive promoter between layers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for increasing adhesion between golf ball layers comprising the steps of providing a golf ball layer having a first surface; preparing the first surface for treatment; exposing the first layer to a silane; providing a second golf ball layer; and adhering the second layer to the first via the silane. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The golf ball of the present invention includes a core and a cover surrounding the core. The core and/or the cover may have more than one layer and an intermediate layer may be disposed between the core and the cover of the golf ball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The golf ball cores of the present invention may comprise any of a variety of constructions. For example, the core of the golf ball may comprise a conventional center surrounded by an intermediate or outer core layer disposed between the center and the inner cover layer. The core may be a single layer or may comprise a plurality of layers. The innermost portion of the core may be solid or it may be a liquid filled sphere. As with the core, the intermediate layer or outer core layer may also comprise a plurality of layers. The core may also comprise a solid or liquid filled center around which many yards of a tensioned elastomeric material are wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The materials for solid cores include compositions having a base rubber, a crosslinking agent, a filler, and a co-crosslinking or initiator agent. The base rubber typically includes natural or synthetic rubbers. A preferred base rubber is 1,4-polybutadiene having a cis-structure of at least 40%. Most preferably, the base rubber comprises high-Mooney-viscosity rubber. If desired, the polybutadiene can also be mixed with other elastomers known in the art such as natural rubber, polyisoprene rubber and/or styrene-butadiene rubber in order to modify the properties of the core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The crosslinking agent includes a metal salt of an unsaturated fatty acid such as a zinc salt or a magnesium salt of an unsaturated fatty acid having 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as acrylic or methacrylic acid. Suitable cross linking agents include one or more metal salt diacrylates, dimethacrylates and monomethacrylates wherein the metal is magnesium, calcium, zinc, aluminum, sodium, lithium or nickel. Preferred acrylates include zinc acrylate, zinc diacrylate, zinc methacrylate, and zinc dimethacrylate, and mixtures thereof. The crosslinking agent is typically present in an amount greater than about 10 phr of the polymer component, preferably from about 10 to 40 phr of the polymer component, more preferably from about 10 to 30 phr of the polymer component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The initiator agent can be any known polymerization initiator which decomposes during the cure cycle. Suitable initiators include peroxide compounds such as dicumyl peroxide, 1,1-di(t-butylperoxy) 3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, a-a bis (t-butylperoxy) diisopropylbenzene, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5 di(t-butylperoxy) hexane or di-t-butyl peroxide and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Fillers typically include materials such as tungsten, zinc oxide, barium sulfate, silica, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, metals, metal oxides and salts, regrind (recycled core material typically ground to about 30 mesh particle), high-Mooney-viscosity rubber regrind, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Fillers added to one or more portions of the golf ball typically include processing aids or compounds to affect rheological and mixing properties, density-modifying fillers, tear strength, or reinforcement fillers, and the like. The fillers are generally inorganic, and suitable fillers include numerous metals or metal oxides, such as zinc oxide and tin oxide, as well as barium sulfate, zinc sulfate, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, clay, tungsten, tungsten carbide, an array of silicas, and mixtures thereof. Fillers may also include various foaming agents or blowing agents which may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Fillers may include polymeric, ceramic, metal, and glass microspheres may be solid or hollow, and filled or unfilled. Fillers are typically also added to one or more portions of the golf ball to modify the density thereof to conform to uniform golf ball standards. Fillers may also be used to modify the weight of the center or at least one additional layer for specialty balls, e.g., a lower weight ball is preferred for a player having a low swing speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a method to convert the cis-isomer of the polybutadiene resilient polymer component to the trans-isomer during a molding cycle and to form a golf ball. A variety of methods and materials have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,135 and U.S. application Ser. No. 09/461,736, filed Dec. 16, 1999; 09/458,676, filed Dec. 10, 1999; and Ser. No. 09/461,421, filed Dec. 16, 1999, each of which are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The materials used in forming either the golf ball center or any portion of the core, in accordance with the invention, may be combined to form a mixture by any type of mixing known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Suitable types of mixing include single pass and multi-pass mixing. Suitable mixing equipment is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and such equipment may include a Banbury mixer, a two-roll mill, or a twin screw extruder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Conventional mixing speeds for combining polymers are typically used. The mixing temperature depends upon the type of polymer components, and more importantly, on the type of free-radical initiator. Suitable mixing speeds and temperatures are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, or may be readily determined without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The mixture can be subjected to, e.g., a compression or injection molding process, to obtain solid spheres for the center or hemispherical shells for forming an intermediate layer. The temperature and duration of the molding cycle are selected based upon reactivity of the mixture. The molding cycle may have a single step of molding the mixture at a single temperature for a fixed time duration. The molding cycle may also include a two-step process, in which the polymer mixture is held in the mold at an initial temperature for an initial duration of time, followed by holding at a second, typically higher temperature for a second duration of time. In a preferred embodiment of the current invention, a single-step cure cycle is employed. The materials used in forming either the golf ball center or any portion of the core, in accordance with the invention, may be combined to form a golf ball by an injection molding process, which is also well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Although the curing time depends on the various materials selected, those of ordinary skill in the art will be readily able to adjust the curing time upward or downward based on the particular materials used and the discussion herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The cover provides the interface between the ball and a club. Properties that are desirable for the cover include good moldability, high abrasion resistance, high tear strength, high resilience, and good mold release. The cover typically has a thickness to provide sufficient strength, good performance characteristics, and durability. The cover preferably has a thickness of less than about 0.1 inches, more preferably, less than about 0.05 inches, and most preferably, between about 0.02 inches and about 0.04 inches. The invention is particularly directed towards a multilayer golf ball which comprises a core, an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. In this embodiment, preferably, at least one of the inner and outer cover layer has a thickness of less than about 0.05 inches, more preferably between about 0.02 inches and about 0.04 inches. Most preferably, the thickness of either layer is about 0.03 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When the golf ball of the present invention includes an inner cover layer, this layer can include any materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including thermoplastic and thermosetting material, but preferably the inner cover can include any suitable materials, such as ionic copolymers of ethylene and an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid which are available under the trademark SURLYN&reg; of E.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art that if the saturated polyurethane materials are to be blended with other thermoplastics, care must be taken in the formulation process so as to produce an end product which is thermoplastic in nature. Thermoplastic materials may be blended with other thermoplastic materials, but thermosetting materials are difficult if not impossible to blend homogeneously after the thermosetting materials are formed. Preferably, the saturated polyurethane comprises from about 1 to about 100%, more preferably from about 10 to about 75% of the cover composition and/or the intermediate layer composition. About 90 to about 10%, more preferably from about 90 to about 25% of the cover and/or the intermediate layer composition is comprised of one or more other polymers and/or other materials as described below. Such polymers include, but are not limited to polyurethane/polyurea ionomers, polyurethanes or polyureas, epoxy resins, polyethylenes, polyamides and polyesters, polycarbonates and polyacrylin. Unless otherwise stated herein, all percentages are given in percent by weight of the total composition of the golf ball layer in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Polyurethane prepolymers are produced by combining at least one polyol, such as a polyether, polycaprolactone, polycarbonate or a polyester, and at least one isocyanate. Thermosetting polyurethanes are obtained by curing at least one polyurethane prepolymer with a curing agent selected from a polyamine, triol or tetraol. Thermoplastic polyurethanes are generally obtained by curing at least one polyurethane prepolymer with a diol curing agent. The choice of the curatives is critical because some urethane elastomers that are cured with a diol and/or blends of diols do not produce urethane elastomers with the impact resistance required in a golf ball cover. Blending the polyamine curatives with diol cured urethane elastomeric formulations leads to the production of thermoset urethanes with improved impact and cut resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thermoplastic polyurethanes may be blended with suitable materials to produce a thermoplastic end product. Examples of such additional materials may include ionomers such as the SURLYN&reg;, ESCOR&reg; and IOTEK&reg; copolymers described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Other suitable materials which may be combined with the saturated polyurethanes in forming the cover and/or intermediate layer(s)of the golf balls of the invention include ionic or non-ionic polyurethanes and polyureas, epoxy resins, polyethylenes, polyamides and polyesters. For example, the cover and/or intermediate layer may be formed from a blend of at least one saturated polyurethane and thermoplastic or thermoset ionic and non-ionic urethanes and polyurethanes, cationic urethane ionomers and urethane epoxies, ionic and non-ionic polyureas and blends thereof. Examples of suitable urethane ionomers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,974 entitled &ldquo;Golf Ball Covers&rdquo;, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other examples of suitable polyurethanes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,673. Examples of appropriate polyureas are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,870 and examples of suitable polyurethanes cured with epoxy group containing curing agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,358, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A variety of conventional components can be added to the cover compositions of the present invention. These include, but are not limited to, white pigment such as TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ZnO, optical brighteners, surfactants, processing aids, foaming agents, density-controlling fillers, UV stabilizers and light stabilizers. Saturated polyurethanes are resistant to discoloration. However, they are not immune to deterioration in their mechanical properties upon weathering. Addition of UV absorbers and light stabilizers therefore helps to maintain the tensile strength and elongation of the saturated polyurethane elastomers. Suitable UV absorbers and light stabilizers include TINUVIN&reg; 328, TINUVIN&reg; 213, TINUVIN&reg; 765, TINUVIN&reg; 770, TINUVIN&reg; 292, and TINUVIN&reg; 622. The preferred UV absorber is TINUVIN&reg; 328, and the preferred light stabilizer is TINUVIN 765. TINUVIN&reg; products are available from Ciba-Geigy. Dyes, as well as optical brighteners and fluorescent pigments may also be included in the golf ball covers produced with polymers formed according to the present invention. Such additional ingredients may be added in any amounts that will achieve their desired purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used to polyurethanes of the present invention. One commonly employed method, known in the art as a one-shot method, involves concurrent mixing of the polyisocyanate, polyol, and curing agent. This method results in a mixture that is inhomogenous (more random) and affords the manufacturer less control over the molecular structure of the resultant composition. A preferred method of mixing is known as a prepolymer method. In this method, the polyisocyanate and the polyol are mixed separately prior to addition of the curing agent. This method affords a more homogeneous mixture resulting in a more consistent polymer composition. Other methods suitable for forming the layers of the present invention include reaction injection molding (&ldquo;RIM&rdquo;), liquid injection molding (&ldquo;LIM&rdquo;), and pre-reacting the components to form an injection moldable thermoplastic polyurethane and then injection molding, all of which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Additional components which can be added to the polyurethane composition include UV stabilizers and other dyes, as well as optical brighteners and fluorescent pigments and dyes. Such additional ingredients may be added in any amounts that will achieve their desired purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It has been found by the present invention that the use of a castable, reactive material, which is applied in a fluid form, makes it possible to obtain very thin outer cover layers on golf balls. Specifically, it has been found that castable, reactive liquids, which react to form a urethane elastomer material, provide desirable very thin outer cover layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The castable, reactive liquid employed to form the urethane elastomer material can be applied over the core using a variety of application techniques such as spraying, dipping, spin coating, or flow coating methods which are well known in the art. An example of a suitable coating technique is that which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,428, filed May 2, 1995 entitled &ldquo;Method And Apparatus For Forming Polyurethane Cover On A Golf Ball,&rdquo; the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety in the present application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The outer cover is preferably formed around the inner cover by mixing and introducing the material in the mold halves. It is important that the viscosity be measured over time, so that the subsequent steps of filling each mold half, introducing the core into one half and closing the mold can be properly timed for accomplishing centering of the core cover halves fusion and achieving overall uniformity. Suitable viscosity range of the curing urethane mix for introducing cores into the mold halves is determined to be approximately between about 2,000 cP and about 30,000 cP, with the preferred range of about 8,000 cP to about 15,000 cP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> To start the cover formation, mixing of the prepolymer and curative is accomplished in motorized mixer including mixing head by feeding through lines metered amounts of curative and prepolymer. Top preheated mold halves are filled and placed in fixture units using centering pins moving into holes in each mold. At a later time, a bottom mold half or a series of bottom mold halves have similar mixture amounts introduced into the cavity. After the reacting materials have resided in top mold halves for about 40 to about 80 seconds, a core is lowered at a controlled speed into the gelling reacting mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A ball cup holds the ball core through reduced pressure (or partial vacuum). Upon location of the coated core in the halves of the mold after gelling for about 40 to about 80 seconds, the vacuum is released allowing core to be released. The mold halves, with core and solidified cover half thereon, are removed from the centering fixture unit, inverted and mated with other mold halves which, at an appropriate time earlier, have had a selected quantity of reacting polyurethane prepolymer and curing agent introduced therein to commence gelling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,006,297 to Brown et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,673 to Wu both also disclose suitable molding techniques which may be utilized to apply the castable reactive liquids employed in the present invention. Further, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,040 and 6,180,722 disclose methods of preparing dual core golf balls. The disclosures of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. However, the method of the invention is not limited to the use of these techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Depending on the desired properties, balls prepared according to the invention can exhibit substantially the same or higher resilience, or coefficient of restitution (&ldquo;COR&rdquo;), with a decrease in compression or modulus, compared to balls of conventional construction. Additionally, balls prepared according to the invention can also exhibit substantially higher resilience, or COR, without an increase in compression, compared to balls of conventional construction. Another measure of this resilience is the &ldquo;loss tangent,&rdquo; or tan &dgr;, which is obtained when measuring the dynamic stiffness of an object. Loss tangent and terminology relating to such dynamic properties is typically described according to ASTM D4092-90. Thus, a lower loss tangent indicates a higher resiliency, thereby indicating a higher rebound capacity. Low loss tangent indicates that most of the energy imparted to a golf ball from the club is converted to dynamic energy, i.e., launch velocity and resulting longer distance. The rigidity or compressive stiffness of a golf ball may be measured, for example, by the dynamic stiffness. A higher dynamic stiffness indicates a higher compressive stiffness. To produce golf balls having a desirable compressive stiffness, the dynamic stiffness of the crosslinked reaction product material should be less than about 50,000 N/m at &minus;50&deg; C. Preferably, the dynamic stiffness should be between about 10,000 and 40,000 N/m at &minus;50C., more preferably, the dynamic stiffness should be between about 20,000 and 30,000 N/m at &minus;50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The molding process and composition of golf ball portions typically results in a gradient of material properties. Methods employed in the prior art generally exploit hardness to quantify these gradients. Hardness is a qualitative measure of static modulus and does not represent the modulus of the material at the deformation rates associated with golf ball use, i.e., impact by a club. As is well known to one skilled in the art of polymer science, the time-temperature superposition principle may be used to emulate alternative deformation rates. For golf ball portions including polybutadiene, a 1-Hz oscillation at temperatures between 0&deg; C. and &minus;50&deg; C. are believed to be qualitatively equivalent to golf ball impact rates. Therefore, measurement of loss tangent and dynamic stiffness at 0&deg; C. to &minus;50&deg; C. may be used to accurately anticipate golf ball performance, preferably at temperatures between about &minus;20&deg; C. and &minus;50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The resultant golf balls typically have a coefficient of restitution of greater than about 0.7, preferably greater than about 0.75, and more preferably greater than about 0.78. The golf balls also typically have an Atti compression of at least about 40, preferably from about 50 to 120, and more preferably from about 60 to 100. The golf ball cured polybutadiene material typically has a hardness of at least about 15 Shore A, preferably between about 30 Shore A and 80 Shore D, more preferably between about 50 Shore A and 60 Shore D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The core composition should comprise at least one rubber material having a resilience index of at least about 40. Preferably the resilience index is at least about 50. Polymers that produce resilient golf balls and, therefore, are suitable for the present invention, include but are not limited to CB23, CB22, commercially available from of Bayer Corp. of Orange, Tex., BR60, commercially available from Enichem of Italy, and 1207G, commercially available from Goodyear Corp. of Akron, Ohio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the unvulcanized rubber, such as polybutadiene, in golf balls prepared according to the invention typically has a Mooney viscosity of between about 40 and about 80, more preferably, between about 45 and about 65, and most preferably, between about 45 and about 55. Mooney viscosity is typically measured according to ASTM-D1646. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When golf balls are prepared according to the invention, they typically will have dimple coverage greater than about 60 percent, preferably greater than about 65 percent, and more preferably greater than about 75 percent. The flexural modulus of the cover on the golf balls, as measured by ASTM method D6272-98, Procedure B, is typically greater than about 500 psi, and is preferably from about 500 psi to 150,000 psi. As discussed herein, the outer cover layer is preferably formed from a relatively soft polyurethane material. In particular, the material of the outer cover layer should have a material hardness, as measured by ASTM-D2240, less than about 45 Shore D, preferably less than about 40 Shore D, more preferably between about 25 and about 40 Shore D, and most preferably between about 30 and about 40 Shore D. The casing preferably has a material hardness of less than about 70 Shore D, more preferably between about 30 and about 70 Shore D, and most preferably, between about 50 and about 65 Shore D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the casing material hardness is between about 40 and about 70 Shore D and the outer cover layer material hardness is less than about 40 Shore D. In a more preferred embodiment, a ratio of the casing material hardness to the outer cover layer material hardness is greater than 1.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It should be understood, especially to one of ordinary skill in the art, that there is a fundamental difference between &ldquo;material hardness&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardness, as measured directly on a golf ball.&rdquo; Material hardness is defined by the procedure set forth in ASTM-D2240 and generally involves measuring the hardness of a flat &ldquo;slab&rdquo; or &ldquo;button&rdquo; formed of the material of which the hardness is to be measured. Hardness, when measured directly on a golf ball (or other spherical surface) is a completely different measurement and, therefore, results in a different hardness value. This difference results from a number of factors including, but not limited to, ball construction (i.e., core type, number of core and/or cover layers, etc.), ball (or sphere) diameter, and the material composition of adjacent layers. It should also be understood that the two measurement techniques are not linearly related and, therefore, one hardness value cannot easily be correlated to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The core of the present invention has an Atti compression of between about 50 and about 90, more preferably, between about 60 and about 85, and most preferably, between about 65 and about 85. The overall outer diameter (&ldquo;OD&rdquo;) of the core is less than about 1.590 inches, preferably, no greater than 1.580 inches, more preferably between about 1.540 inches and about 1.580 inches, and most preferably between about 1.525 inches to about 1.570 inches. The OD of the casing of the golf balls of the present invention is preferably between 1.580 inches and about 1.640 inches, more preferably between about 1.590 inches to about 1.630 inches, and most preferably between about 1.600 inches to about 1.630 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The present multilayer golf ball can have an overall diameter of any size. Although the United States Golf Association (&ldquo;USGA&rdquo;) specifications limit the minimum size of a competition golf ball to 1.680 inches. There is no specification as to the maximum diameter. Golf balls of any size, however, can be used for recreational play. The preferred diameter of the present golf balls is from about 1.680 inches to about 1.800 inches. The more preferred diameter is from about 1.680 inches to about 1.760 inches. The most preferred diameter is about 1.680 inches to about 1.740 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The golf balls of the present invention should have a moment of inertia (&ldquo;MOI&rdquo;) of less than about 85 and, preferably, less than about 83. The MOI is typically measured on model number MOI-005-104 Moment of Inertia Instrument manufactured by Inertia Dynamics of Collinsville, Conn. The instrument is plugged into a PC for communication via a COMM port and is driven by MOI Instrument Software version &num;1.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it has been found that improved adhesion between golf ball layers, such as between inner and outer cover layers, can be achieved when low surface energy materials, such as ionomers and/or polyurethanes, are treated with silane coupling agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Silane coupling agents have two different types of reactive groups:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> X represents an organofunctional group that reacts with organic materials, such as synthetic resins, and is typically a vinyl, epoxy, amino, methacryl, acryl, isocyanato, or mercapto group; and OR represents the silicon functional group that reacts with inorganic materials and is typically a methoxy, ethoxy, or acetoxy groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the presence of water, coupling agents produce highly reactive silanols which, in turn, condense to form oligomeric structures. In this manner, silanes can form durable chemical &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; between materials, facilitating bonding between a low energy surface and a polymer matrix. The silane coupling agent forms a covalent bond with both the polymer matrix and the lower energy surface, thereby making a durable, UV and moisture stable, crosslinked network between the two materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Corona/plasma treatment of the low energy surface creates reaction sites (reactive &mdash;OH groups) to which the silicon-functional group can bond. Corona discharge/plasma treatment of golf ball cores and layers is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/389,058, filed Sep. 2, 1999, which is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by express reference thereto. The silane coupling agent is preferably present in a aqueous bath and the corona-treated substrate, preferably a golf ball core or center (with optional layers), is immersed in the bath. In this manner, the silane is hydrolized. One of ordinary skill in the art would be aware that a silane may also be hydrolized with ambient moisture. The silane then undergoes a condensation reaction with reactive sites on the substrate surface allowing the coupling agent to be covalently bound to the surface, and the surface is removed from the bath. Excess water on the core surface is allowed to evaporate and the substrate is introduced to a reactive layer component, preferably a polyurethane outer cover layer. The organofunctional group reacts with the layer precurser to complete the &ldquo;bridge,&rdquo; improving adhesion between the two layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Suitable silanes include, but are not limited to, silane esters, such as octyltriethoxysilane, methyltriethoxylsilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, and proprietary nonionic silane dispersing agent; vinyl silanes, such as proprietary, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyl-tris-(2-methoxyethoxy) silane, vinylmethyldimethoxysilane; methacryloxy silanes, such as &ggr;-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane; epoxy silanes, such as &bgr;-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltrimethoxysilane, &ggr;-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane; sulfur silanes, such as gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane proprietary polysulfidesilane, bis-(3-&lsqb;triethoxisily&rsqb;-propyl)-tetrasulfane; amino silanes, such as &ggr;-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, &ggr;-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, &ggr;-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aminoalkyl silicone solution, modified aminoorganosilane, gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, n-&bgr;-(aminoethyl)-&ggr;-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, modified aminoorganosilane (40% in methanol), modified aminosilane (50% in methanol), triaminofunctional silane, bis-(,&ggr;-trimethoxysilylpropyl)amine, n-phenyl-&ggr;-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, organomodified polydimethylsiloxane, polyazamide silane (50% in methanol), n-&bgr;-(aminoethyl)-&ggr;-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane; ureido silanes, such as gamma-ureidopropyltrialkoxysilane (50% in methanol), &ggr;-ureidopropyltrimethoxysilane; isocyanate silanes, such as &ggr;-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane; and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the silane is an amino silane and more preferably, the amino silane is bis-(&ggr;-trimethoxysilylpropyl) amine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The silane treatment may be performed alone or in combination with corona discharge and/or plasma treatment. Further, the method of improving adhesion may be combined with a plurality of washing and/or drying steps. Preferably, the surface on which improved adhesion is desired are washed. The washing step is optionally followed by a rinsing step but preferably, no rinse step is performed after the first wash. The surface to be treated is then exposed to plasma or corona discharge for a predetermined time, preferably greater than about 1 sec, more preferably less than about 10 sec. The surface to be treated can be rotated by a predetermined amount to ensure that the maximum surface area is properly exposed to the plasma treatment. Preferably the surface to be treated is rotated by at least about &frac14; turn. The surface may optionally undergo surface roughening or gleebar grinding in preparation for receiving the silane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The surface to be treated is exposed to the silane of choice, preferably an amino silane and more preferably, bis-(&ggr;-trimethoxysilylpropyl)amine, commercially available under the tradename Silquest A-1170 from OSi Specialties of Endicott, N.Y. The silane may be neat or in solution. Preferably, the silane is present in an amount less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 2%. The treated surface is then dried and prepared for final construction into a golf ball. This step may include chilling or preheating a center or a core (and any optional layers thereon), followed by casting of at least one outer layer. </paragraph>
