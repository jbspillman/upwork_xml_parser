<section>
<heading lvl="1">Introduction </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a viscera retainer for use in surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Retraction of organs is necessary in surgery when the operative field would otherwise be obscured by the position of the organs. This happens for example in removal of the gall bladder when the liver must be retracted to allow the bladder to be identified, mobilised and removed or in surgery in the pelvic area when the small and large intenstines must be retracted superiorly to permit access to the pelvic floor. Retraction can be achieved using surgical devices such as rigid retractors, soft surgical swabs, sponges or laparotomy packs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Rigid retractors are usually flat metal or plastic devices that come in many shapes depending on the organ to be retracted. They are usually of a rounded, smooth construction in an attempt to be smooth against the wound edge or organ being retracted. A surgical department would have to have many of these different retractors for use in the different surgical procedures that were carried out in the hospital. These devices would usually be sterilisable and reusable. Rigid retractors are held in position either manually or by fixation to an external frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Swabs, sponges and laparotomy packs are gauze or other textile material folded several times into a square pack that may be rolled up or otherwise squashed into position in the abdomen to compress and displace internal organs away from the operative field. They are generally inconvenient to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> EP-A-0267640 describes a form retainable unit comprising an airtight outer envelope, layers of flexible fibre material in the envelope and spheres between the layers of fiber material. On evacuation of the envelope the spheres become fixed in place and hold the envelope in a deformed holding configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This form retainable unit works well in practice, however there are problems in manufacturing the required structure. Consequently, the costs of the manufactured unit are relatively high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention is therefore directed towards providing an improved form retainable unit which will overcome at least some of these difficulties. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings and initially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> there is illustrated a viscera retainer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprising an outer envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of substantially air-tight pliable plastics material formed by heat sealing a pair of sheets of plastics along side marginal edges thereof as indicated by heat welding lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The envelope has an evacuation port <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> fitted with a tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a clamp (not shown). Air is drawn from the envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is closed by the clamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a sandwich structure comprising at least two and usually several sheets therein. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> there are alternate sheets of elastic material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and sheets of relatively inelastic material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this case there are inner, outer and median sheets of elastic material sandwiching two sheets of relatively inelastic material. The envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is illustrated diagrammatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In use, it would be flush with the outer sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The elastic sheets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably of open cell foam material such as of a polyurethane foam. One such elastic material is available under the name Kayflex V60F from Advanced Materials Limited of Ireland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The relatively inelastic sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are preferably of closed cell material such as of polystyrene material. One such relatively inelastic material is available under the name Epren from Advanced Materials Limited of Ireland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The sheets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are malleable and arranged in face to face relation in the envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. During manipulation, the sheets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are relatively free to slide over one another so that the envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and sheets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be conformed to a desired shape. The envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then evacuated and the sheets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are restrained from sliding relative to one another and the unit is thereby retained in a desired form retained configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In use, the viscera retainer is inserted into a wound opening and moulded into a required shape retaining, for example an organ in a desired position. The envelope <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then evacuated, the tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is clamped and the unit retains the formed shape as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> supporting and retaining an organ allowing a surgeon to continue an operation unimpeded. It will be apparent, particularly from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> that the sheets slide relative to each other during forming and are maintained in a displaced configuration by the application of a vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> all of the sheets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are of the same inelastic material such as that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The malleable viscera retainer is used for retraction of internal organs during open surgery. Its function is to improve visibility in the area of interest during a surgical operation by compressing and displacing viscera such as abdominal organs, heart or lungs that would otherwise be in the way. This is generally referred to as surgical retraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The retainer is employed by positioning it within the abdominal cavity while it is in its relaxed, malleable state. When it is in the desired position a vacuum is applied causing the retainer to become rigid and maintain its shape and position. In this way the device acts as a surgical retractor. By releasing a clamp air is allowed to re-enter the envelope causing it to become malleable and formable again. In this way the retainer can be repositioned conveniently during surgery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The retainer is soft and atraumatic. It is non-absorbent and its method of retraction is not dependent on staying dry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> there is illustrated another viscera retainer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the invention which is of the same envelope and sheet construction as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In this case the retainer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the unformed configuration is arcuate and is mounted to a mounting ring <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The mounting ring <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may, in turn be mounted to a wound protector retractor unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in an incision <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, for example in the abdomen <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The retainer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used as described above, for example, to retain viscera such as an organ or part thereof indicated generally by the reference number <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that it does not obstruct access through the wound protector retractor unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The viscera retainer is inexpensive to manufacture as the sheets may be pre-cut to a desired size, are readily assembled in a sandwich configuration and housed within an envelope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to the embodiments hereinbefore described which may be varied in construction and detail. </paragraph>
