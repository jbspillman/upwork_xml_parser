<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to endoluminal stents and grafts designed for delivery into an anatomical passageway using minimally invasive techniques, such as percutaneous intravascular delivery using a delivery catheter passed over a guidewire. More particularly, the present invention relates to endoluminal stents having a scaffold structure and structural geometry which is particularly well-suited for providing physiologically acceptable radial or hoop strength and longitudinal flexibility, while also presenting a luminal surface thereof which presents less obstruction to longitudinal shear forces during fluid flow across the luminal surface of the inventive device while maximizing fatigue life and corrosion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Endoluminal stents are generally tubular scaffolds fabricated from implantable biocompatible materials. Stents have a generally tubular geometry characterized by a central lumen, a longitudinal axis, a circumferential axis and a radial axis. Conventional endoluminal stents fall within three general classifications: balloon expandable, self-expanding and shape-memory. Balloon expandable stents require mechanical intervention, such as by using a balloon catheter, to apply a positive pressure radially outward from a central lumen of the stent to mechanically deform the stent and urge it to a larger diameter. Self-expanding stents utilize inherent material mechanical properties of the stent material to expand the stent. Typically, self-expanding stents are fabricated of materials that rebound when a positive pressure is exerted against the material. Self-expanding stents are fabricated such that their zero-stress configuration conforms to the second larger diameter. The self-expanding stents are drawn down to the first smaller diameter and constrained within a delivery catheter for endoluminal delivery. Removal of the constraint releases the constraining pressure and the self-expanding stent, under its own mechanical properties, rebounds to the second larger diameter. Finally, shape-memory stents rely upon unique alloys that exhibit shape memory under certain thermal conditions. Conventional shape-memory stents are typically nickel-titanium alloys known generically as nitinol, which have a transition phase at or near normal body temperature, i.e., 37 degrees Centigrade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The prior art is replete with various stent designs across all stent classifications. One of the difficulties with many conventional stent designs arises due to the conflicting criteria between the desired properties of circumferential or hoop strength of the stent, longitudinal or column strength, longitudinal flexibility, fish-scaling of individual structural members of the stent, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, corrosion fatigue, hemodynamics, radioopacity and biocompatibility and the capability of passing the stent through an already implanted stent. Typically, stents that are designed to optimize for hoop strength typically sacrifice either column strength and/or longitudinal flexibility, while stents that are designed to optimize for column strength often compromise longitudinal flexibility and/or hoop strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been found desirable to devise an endoluminal stent which employs a series of first and second structural elements arrayed in geometrical patterns which achieve a balance between hoop strength, column strength and longitudinal flexibility of the endoluminal stent. Many conventional stents employ a series of circumferential structural elements and longitudinal structural elements of varying configurations. A large number of conventional stents utilize circumferential structural elements configured into a serpentine configuration or a zig-zag configuration. The reason underlying this configuration is the need for radial expansion of the stent. Of these conventional stents which employ serpentine or zig-zag circumferential structural elements, many also employ longitudinal structural elements which join adjacent circumferential structural elements and provide a modicum of longitudinal or column strength while retaining longitudinal flexibility of the device. Additionally, many conventional stents require welds to join mating surfaces of the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, however, the art has not devised a unibody stent structural element geometry which achieves a balance between hoop strength, column strength and longitudinal flexibility, circumferential strength or hoop strength of the stent, longitudinal strength or column strength, longitudinal flexibility, fish-scaling of individual structural members of the stent, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, corrosion fatigue, hemodynamics, radioopacity, biocompatibility and the capability of passing the stent through an already implanted stent. The term &ldquo;fish-scaling&rdquo; is used in the art and herein to describe a condition where some stent structural elements extend beyond the circumferential plane of the stent during either radial expansion, implantation or while passing the stent through a bend in the vasculature. Those of ordinary skill in the art understand that fish-scaling of stent structural elements may cause the stent to impinge or snag upon the anatomical tissue either during endoluminal delivery or after implantation. The term &ldquo;unibody&rdquo; as used herein is intended to mean a stent that is fabricated without the use of welds and as an integral body of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The inventive endoluminal stent may be, but is not necessarily, fabricated by vapor deposition techniques. Vapor deposition fabrication of the inventive stents offers many advantages, including, without limitation, the ability to fabricate stents of complex geometries, the ability to control fatigue life, corrosion resistance, corrosion fatigue, bulk and surface material properties, and the ability to vary the transverse profiles, Z-axis thickness and X-Y-axis surface area of the stent&apos;s structural elements in manners that affect the longitudinal flexibility, hoop strength of the stent and radial expansion profiles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Endoluminal stent and stent-graft design inherently attempts to optimize the functional aspects of radial expandability, i.e., the ratio of delivery diameter to expanded diameter, hoop strength, longitudinal flexibility, column strength, fish-scaling of individual structural members of the stent, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, corrosion fatigue, hemodynamics, biocompatibility and the capability of stent-through-stent delivery. Conventional stent designs have had to compromise one or more functional features of a stent in order to maximize a particular functionality, e.g., longitudinal flexibility is minimized in order to achieve desirable column strength or high hoop strengths are achieved at the expense of small ratios of radial expandability. It is an objective of the present invention to provide designs for endoluminal unibody stents that achieve balances between the ratio of radial expandability, hoop strength, longitudinal flexibility and column strength, with biocompatibility, hemodynamics, radioopacity, minimal or no fish-scaling and increased capacity for endothelialization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention consists generally of an endoluminal stent and self-supporting endoluminal graft each of which is formed from generally two interconnecting structural regions. First structural regions define circumferential sections of the endoluminal stent, provide the endoluminal stent with hoop strength, and are regions of relatively higher stent pattern density. The first structural regions are formed of a plurality of structural elements oriented circumferentially about the stent and are arrayed in adjacent, spaced-apart relationship with one another along the longitudinal axis of the endoluminal stent. Second structural regions define longitudinal support sections that interconnect adjacent circumferential sections in adjacent pairs of first structural regions and provide longitudinal or column strength to the endoluminal stent. The second structural regions are formed of a plurality of structural members oriented generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the endoluminal stent and generally perpendicular to the orientation of the structural elements forming the first structural regions and are arrayed about the circumference of the endoluminal stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Two general embodiments of the stent of the present invention are disclosed. A first embodiment consists of second structural regions comprised of a plurality of longitudinal structural members each of which has a generally sinusoidal configuration along the longitudinal axis of the endoluminal stent, and the first structural regions are comprised of a plurality of sinusoidal structural elements that interconnect adjacent pairs of the structural elements of the second structural regions. This first embodiment is generally referred to herein as the &ldquo;longitudinally flexible stent.&rdquo; A second embodiment consists of second structural regions comprised of a plurality of generally linear second structural members which extend the entire longitudinal axis of the endoluminal stent; the first structural regions are comprised of a plurality of sinusoidal structural elements which interconnect adjacent pairs of the plurality of generally linear second structural elements in spaced apart relationship. This second embodiment is generally referred to as the &ldquo;columnar stent.&rdquo; For purposes of the present application, an individual structural element with a serpentine pattern or a zig-zag configuration having either regular or irregular periodicity or both in the some or all of the peaks and troughs is referred to as being &ldquo;sinusoidal&rdquo; or having a &ldquo;sine-wave configuration.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the inventive endoluminal stent, there is provided endoluminal stent that is comprised of a plurality of first structural elements that together form the circumference of the stent and extending along the longitudinal axis of the stent, and a plurality of second structural elements that interconnect adjacent pairs of first structural elements. Each of the plurality of first structural elements has a generally sinusoidal configuration with a regular or irregular periodicity or both between the peaks and troughs of the pattern, with the peaks and troughs projecting from the first structural elements in the circumferential axis. The plurality of second structural elements are generally linear members which interconnect an apex of a peak of one of the plurality of first structural elements with an apex of a valley of a second and adjacent one of the plurality of first structural elements. Each of the plurality of second structural elements are generally oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The plurality of first structural elements is arrayed about and forms the circumference of the stent, with individual first structural elements extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent. Each of the plurality of first structural elements preferably extends substantially the entire longitudinal axis of the stent, however, it is contemplated that some or all of the plurality of first structural elements may be oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent without extending substantially the entire longitudinal axis of the stent. Each of the plurality of first structural elements generally has a sine-wave configuration with the element being formed into successive peaks and troughs extending along the longitudinal axis of the stent. Again, it will be understood that the terms &ldquo;sine-wave configuration&rdquo; or &ldquo;sinusoidal&rdquo; are intended to include elements which have peaks and troughs with regular or irregular periodicity throughout the longitudinal axis of the element or which have peaks and troughs with regions of regular and regions of irregular periodicity along the longitudinal axis of the element, the peaks and troughs and the apices of the peaks and troughs may have many shapes, including, without limitation, regular curves, irregular curves, Z-shaped, U-shaped or the like. The plurality of first structural elements are arrayed in phase with one another, such that the peaks and troughs of one of the plurality of first structural elements in circumferentially aligned with the peaks and troughs of an adjacent first structural elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Each of the plurality of second structural elements comprises generally linear members which interconnect adjacent pairs of first structural elements. Each of the plurality of second structural elements is either integral with or conjoined the first structural elements with which it is associated. Each of the plurality of second structural elements joins to a trough of one first structural element with a peak of a second first structural element, with successive troughs of one first structural element being joined with successive peaks of the second first structural element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive endoluminal stent may consist of a plurality of substantially linear first structural elements oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent and a plurality of generally sinusoidal second structural elements which interconnect adjacent pairs of the first structural elements and extend generally about the circumferential axis of the stent. Each of the plurality of first structural elements preferably extends substantially the entire longitudinal axis of the stent, again, however, it is contemplated that some or all of the plurality of first structural elements may be oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent without extending substantially the entire longitudinal axis of the stent. The plurality of generally sinusoidal second structural elements form the circumferential links of the stent, and permit radial expansion, either by an applied radially outwardly directed force which plastically deforms the second structural elements, under inherent spring tension or as a result of shape memory properties of the stent material, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with all embodiments of the present invention, the plurality of first structural elements and the plurality of second structural elements may be fabricated of like biocompatible materials, preferably, biocompatible metals or metal alloys. In this manner, both the plurality of first structural elements and the plurality of second structural elements have like physical material properties, e.g., tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, plastic deformability, spring bias, shape memory or super-elastic properties. Alternatively, the plurality of first structural elements and the plurality of second structural elements may be fabricated of biocompatible materials, preferably, biocompatible metals or metal alloys which exhibit different physical or material properties. In this latter case, the plurality of first structural elements may, for example, be fabricated of a plastically deformable material, such as stainless steel, while the plurality of second structural elements are fabricated of a shape memory or super-elastic material, such as nickel-titanium alloys, or of a spring biased material, such as stainless steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, joints between discrete sections of endoluminal stents required welds in order to join sections of the stent. One particular advantage of the present invention is that by forming the stent using vapor deposition techniques, not only are discrete sections atomically joined without the use of welds, but different materials may be employed in different and discrete sections of the stent in order to impart distinct material properties and, therefore, functionality, to the discrete sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, the present invention also includes a self-supporting endoluminal graft. As used herein the term &ldquo;graft&rdquo; is intended to indicate any type of tubular member that exhibits integral columnar and circumferential strength and which has openings that pass through the thickness of the tubular member. The inventive self-supporting endoluminal graft preferably consists of a member formed of at least one of a plurality of layers, each layer being comprised of a plurality of first and second structural elements which intersect one another, as described above, to define a plurality of open regions between intersecting pairs of the first and second structural elements. A web region subtends at least a portion of the open region to at least partially enclose each of the plurality of open regions. Successive adjacent layers of the plurality of layers are positioned such that the open regions are staggered in the Z-axis transverse through the wall of the self-supporting endoluminal graft. By staggering the open regions, interlamellar spaces are created to facilitate endothelialization of the endoluminal graft.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention there is provided several preferred embodiments. In each of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the general configuration of the inventive endoluminal stent is identical. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the inventive endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists generally of a tubular cylindrical element having a stent wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that defines a central lumen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the stent. A plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are arrayed about the circumferential axis C&prime; of the stent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extend parallel along the longitudinal axis of stent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> interconnects adjacent pairs of the plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each of the plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have a generally sinusoidal configuration with a plurality of peaks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a plurality of troughs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of each first structural element. As noted above, the plurality of peaks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the plurality of troughs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may have either regular or irregular periodicity along the longitudinal axis of each of the plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or each of the plurality of first structural elements may have regions of regular periodicity and regions of irregular periodicity. Each of the plurality of second structural elements preferably comprise linear elements which interconnect a peak <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a first one of the first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a trough <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a second one of the first structural elements adjacent the first one of the first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The plurality of first <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> structural elements are preferably made of materials selected from the group consisting of elemental titanium, vanadium, aluminum, nickel, tantalum, zirconium, chromium, silver, gold, silicon, magnesium, niobium, scandium, platinum, cobalt, palladium, manganese, molybdenum and alloys thereof, and nitinol and stainless steel. The plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be made of the same material or of different materials and have the same material properties or have different material properties. The term &ldquo;material properties&rdquo; is intended to encompass physical properties, including without limitation, elasticity, tensile strength, mechanical properties, hardness, bulk and/or surface grain size, grain composition, and grain boundary size, intra and inter-granular precipitates. Similarly, the materials selected for the plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be selected to have the same of different chemical properties. The term &ldquo;chemical properties&rdquo; is intended to encompass both any chemical reaction and change of state that the material may undergo after being implanted into a body and the physiological response of the body to the material after implantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The inventive stent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including the plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and second structural elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is preferably made of a bulk material having controlled heterogeneities on the luminal surface thereof. As is described in co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/443,929, filed Nov. 19, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference, heterogeneities are controlled by fabricating the bulk material of the stent to have defined grain sizes, chemical and intra and intergranular precipitates and where the bulk and surface morphology differ, yielding areas or sites along the surface of the stent while maintaining acceptable or optimal protein binding capability. The characteristically desirable properties of the inventive stent are: (a) optimum mechanical properties consistent with or exceeding regulatory approval criteria, (b) minimization of defects, such as cracking or pin hole defects, (c) a fatigue life of 400 MM cycles as measured by simulated accelerated testing, (d) corrosion and/or corrosion-fatigue resistance, (e) biocompatibility without having biologically significant impurities in the material, (f) a substantially non-frictional abluminal surface to facilitate atraumatic vascular crossing and tracking and compatible with transcatheter techniques for stent introduction, (g) radiopaque at selected sites and MRI compatible, (h) have a luminal surface which is optimized for surface energy and microtopography, (i) minimal manufacturing and material cost consistent with achieving the desired material properties, and (j) high process yields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing properties are achieved by fabricating a stent by the same metal deposition methodologies as are used and standard in the microelectronics and nano-fabrication vacuum coating arts, and which are hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred deposition methodologies include ion-beam assisted evaporative deposition and sputtering techniques. In ion beam-assisted evaporative deposition it is preferable to employ dual and simultaneous thermal electron beam evaporation with simultaneous ion bombardment of the substrate using an inert gas, such as argon, xenon, nitrogen or neon. Bombardment with an inert gas, such as argon ions serves to reduce void content by increasing the atomic packing density in the deposited material during deposition. The reduced void content in the deposited material allows the mechanical properties of that deposited material to be similar to the bulk material properties. Deposition rates up to 20 nm/sec are achievable using ion beam-assisted evaporative deposition techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When sputtering techniques are employed, a 200-micron thick stainless steel film may be deposited within about four hours of deposition time. With the sputtering technique, it is preferable to employ a cylindrical sputtering target, a single circumferential source that concentrically surrounds the substrate that is held in a coaxial position within the source. Alternate deposition processes which may be employed to form the stent in accordance with the present invention are cathodic arc, laser ablation, and direct ion beam deposition. When employing vacuum deposition methodologies, the crystalline structure of the deposited film affects the mechanical properties of the deposited film. These mechanical properties of the deposited film may be modified by post-process treatment, such as by, for example, annealing, high-pressure treatment or gas quenching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Materials to make the inventive stents are chosen for their biocompatibility, mechanical properties, i.e., tensile strength, yield strength, and their ease of deposition include the following: elemental titanium, vanadium, aluminum, nickel, tantalum, zirconium, chromium, silver, gold, silicon, magnesium, niobium, scandium, platinum, cobalt, palladium, manganese, molybdenum and alloys thereof, such as zirconium-titanium-tantalum alloys, nitinol, and stainless steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> During deposition, the chamber pressure, the deposition pressure and the partial pressure of the process gases are controlled to optimize deposition of the desired species onto the substrate. As is known in the microelectronic fabrication, nano-fabrication and vacuum coating arts, both the reactive and non-reactive gases are controlled and the inert or non-reactive gaseous species introduced into the deposition chamber are typically argon and nitrogen. The substrate may be either stationary or moveable, either rotated about its longitudinal axis, or moved in an X-Y plane within the reactor to facilitate deposition or patterning of the deposited material onto the substrate. The deposited material maybe deposited either as a uniform solid film onto the substrate, or patterned by (a) imparting either a positive or negative pattern onto the substrate, such as by etching or photolithography techniques applied to the substrate surface to create a positive or negative image of the desired pattern or (b) using a mask or set of masks which are either stationary or moveable relative to the substrate to define the pattern applied to the substrate. Patterning may be employed to achieve complex finished geometries of the resultant stent, both in the context of spatial orientation of the pattern as well as the material thickness at different regions of the deposited film, such as by varying the wall thickness of the material over its length to thicken sections at proximal and distal ends of the stent to prevent flaring of the stent ends upon radial expansion of the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The stent may be removed from the substrate after stent formation by any of a variety of methods. For example, the substrate may be removed by chemical means, such as etching or dissolution, by ablation, by machining or by ultrasonic energy. Alternatively, a sacrificial layer of a material, such as carbon or aluminum, may be deposited intermediate the substrate and the stent and the sacrificial layer removed by melting, chemical means, ablation, machining or other suitable means to free the stent from the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The resulting stent may then be subjected to post-deposition processing to modify the crystalline structure, such as by annealing, or to modify the surface topography, such as by etching to affect and control the heterogeneities on the blood flow surface of the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A plurality of microgrooves may be imparted onto the luminal and/or abluminal surface of the stent <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as is more fully described in International Publication No. WO 99/23977, published May 20, 1999, which is commonly assigned with the present application and is hereby incorporated by reference. The plurality of microgrooves may be formed either as a post-deposition process step, such as by etching, or during deposition, such as by depositing the stent-forming material onto a mandrel which has a microtopography on the surface thereof which causes the metal to deposit with the microgroove pattern as part of the deposited material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Each of the preferred embodiments of the present invention are preferably fabricated by employing a vapor deposition technique which entails vapor depositing a stent-forming metal onto a substrate. The substrate may be planar or cylindrical and is either pre-patterned with one of the preferred geometries of first and second structural elements, in either positive or negative image, or the substrate may be un-patterned. Where the substrate is un-patterned, the deposited stent-forming metal is subjected to post-deposition patterning to pattern the deposited stent-forming metal into one of the preferred geometries of the first and second structural elements. In all embodiments of the present invention fabricated by vapor deposition techniques, the need for post-deposition processing of the patterned endoluminal stent, e.g., modifying the surface of the stent by mechanical, electrical, thermal or chemical machining or polishing, is eliminated or minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Vapor deposition fabrication of the inventive endoluminal stents offers many advantages, including, for example, the ability to fabricate stents of complex geometries, ultrafine dimensional tolerances on the order of Angstroms, the ability to control fatigue life, corrosion resistance, corrosion fatigue, inter- and intra-granular precipitates and their effect on corrosion resistance and corrosion fatigue, bulk material composition, bulk and surface material properties, radioopacity, and the ability to vary the transverse profiles, Z-axis thickness and X-Y-axis surface area of the stent structural elements in manners that affect the longitudinal flexibility, hoop strength, and radial expansion behavior and profile of the stent. Bulk material composition may be adjusted to employ elemental fractions in alloy compositions that are not feasible when using conventionally formed metals. This results in achieving the ability to tailor the alloy compositions in a manner that optimizes the alloy composition for a desired material or mechanical property. For example, nickel-titanium tubes exhibiting shape memory and/or superelastic properties were made employing in excess of 51.5 atomic percent nickel, which is not achievable using conventional working techniques due to high plateau stresses exhibited by the material. Specifically, the present inventors have fabricated nickel-titanium alloy tubes employing the method of the present invention that contain between 51.5 and 55 atomic percent nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Vapor deposition of the inventive endoluminal stent, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, significantly reduces or virtually eliminates inter- and intra-granular precipitates in the bulk material. It is common practice in the nickel-titanium endoluminal device industry to control transition temperatures and resulting mechanical properties by altering local granular nickel-titanium ratios by precipitation regimens. In the present invention, the need to control precipitates for mechanical properties is eliminated. Where nickel-titanium is employed as the stent-forming metal in the present invention, local nickel-titanium ratios will be the same or virtually identical to the nickel-titanium ratios in the bulk material, while still allowing for optimal morphology and eliminating the need for employing precipitation heat treatment. The resulting deposited stent-forming metal exhibits superior corrosion resistance, and hence, resistance to corrosion fatigue, when compared to conventional wrought nickel-titanium alloys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably conformationally configured curing vapor deposition to impart a generally ovular or elliptical transverse cross-sectional profile and have chamfered or curved leading and trailing luminal and abluminal surface edges in the longitudinal axis of the stent in order to provide better blood flow surface profiles. </paragraph>

In addition, each of the first and second structural elements <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also have leading and trailing surfaces which are also radiused (not shown). In this manner, all blood contact surfaces of the inventive endoluminal stent present a curvilinear surface to the blood flow thereby facilitating a more laminar blood flow over the structural elements of the inventive endoluminal stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the longitudinally flexible stent of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C. Like the embodiments described above, longitudinally flexible stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is comprised of a plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The first structural elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are positioned generally parallel to the longitudinal axis L&prime; of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and are arrayed circumferentially about the circumferential axis C&prime; of the endoluminal stents <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are oriented generally parallel to the circumferential axis C&prime; of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and interconnect adjacent pairs of the first structural elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in spaced apart relationship about the circumferential axis C&prime; of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each of the plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preferably has a sinusoidal configuration with at least one complete sine curve, i.e., having both positive and negative amplitude in the proximal and distal directions relative to the longitudinal axis L&prime; of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, being subtended between adjacent pairs of the first structural elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A plurality of flex regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed in each of the plurality of first structural members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Each of the plurality of flex regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed as narrowed regions of the first structural member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and may be configured as V-shaped projections which project circumferentially from each of the plurality of first structural members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the best mode for the present invention, it is contemplated that one of the plurality of flex regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is positioned intermediate adjacent pairs of the second structural elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> along the first structural element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternative configurations are additionally contemplated in which the flex regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are positioned between alternative pairs of second structural elements <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, are positioned only at proximal, distal or intermediate regions of the endoluminal stent, or are positioned only on selected first structural elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or combinations thereof. In this manner, the longitudinal flexibility of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be tailored to impart greater coefficients of longitudinal flexibility in different regions of the endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In each of the foregoing embodiments, the, Z-axis thickness and X-Y-axis surface area of the stent first and second structural elements may be varied so as to affect the longitudinal flexibility, hoop strength and radial expansion behavior and profile of the stent. For example, a longitudinally intermediate circumferential region of the endoluminal stent may have both first and/or second structural elements which have a greater Z-axis wall thickness than proximal and distal circumferential regions of the stent. This configuration effectively reinforces the intermediate circumferential region, with the result being that the proximal and distal circumferential regions of the stent will radially dilate before the intermediate circumferential region. Alternatively, either or both of the proximal and distal circumferential regions may have first and/or second structural elements which have greater Z-axis wall thicknesses than those in a longitudinally intermediate circumferential region. This configuration will result in the longitudinally intermediate circumferential region radially dilating prior to either or both of the proximal and distal circumferential regions. Another alternative is to vary the Z-axis wall thickness of the first and/or second structural elements in a continuum along the longitudinal axis of the endoluminal stent such that the stent radially expands into a conical configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Finally, in accordance with the present invention there is provided a self-supporting endoluminal graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a graft member is formed as a discrete thin sheet or tube of biocompatible metals or metal-like material or as a laminated or plied structure of a plurality of thin sheets or tubes in adjoining relationship with one another. Like the inventive endoluminal stent, described above, the thin sheet or tube includes a plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that provide longitudinal or column strength to the graft, and a plurality of second structural elements <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that provide circumferential or hoop strength to the graft. The first and second structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> form integral and monolithic elements of the graft. A web <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of the material that forms the first and second structural elements partially subtends interstitial openings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> defined between proximate first and second structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. It is preferable that the thin sheet or tube be comprised of pluralities of openings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which pass transversely through the web <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of the graft member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The plurality of openings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> may be random or may be patterned. It is preferable that the size of each of the plurality of openings be such as to permit cellular migration through each opening, without permitting fluid flow there through. In this manner, blood cannot flow through the plurality of openings, but various cells or proteins may freely pass through the plurality of openings to promote graft healing in vivo. The inventive self-supported endoluminal graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be fabricated of two or more discrete members each consisting of the inventive endoluminal stent described above which are concentrically engaged relative to one another, and positioned such that interstitial openings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in each stent member are juxtaposed adjacent a first or second structural element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of an adjacent stent. In this manner the interstitial openings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of each stent <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are at least partially occluded by the first and/or second structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of an adjacent endoluminal stent <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the inventive self-supported endoluminal graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be fabricated by vacuum deposition techniques as described in co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/443,929, filed Nov. 19, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Where the self-supported endoluminal graft is fabricated by vacuum deposition techniques, the graft may be fabricated as a laminated or plied structure in which the first and second structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of a first layer are integral and monolithic with one another, as is the web <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> which subtends the interstitial space <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> between adjacent first and second structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> there is illustrated a laminated self-supported graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is comprised of plural stent layers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which are successively deposited onto one another starting with first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. First stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is comprised of a plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and second structural elements <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, with a plurality of web regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, each of which subtend a space <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> defined by the first and second structural elements. At least one opening <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is provided in at least a portion of the web regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. A second stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is deposited onto the first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Like the first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>second stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is comprised of a plurality of first structural elements <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and second structural elements <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, with a plurality of web regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, each of which subtend a space <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> defined by the first and second structural elements. Second stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be of similar geometry or different geometry than first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and is positioned out-of-phase relative to the geometric pattern of first stent <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In being out-of-phase with first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the first structural element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the second stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is adjacent and overlays both the second structural elements <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the plurality of web regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the openings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in the first stent layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Successive stent layers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and so forth depending upon the particular desired graft construction, are deposited upon one another such that adjacent stent layers form interlamellar endothelial growth channels <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> between successive stent layers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The interlamellar endothelial growth channels <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> promote endothelialization by providing tortuous micropathways for cellular incorporation into the self-supporting graft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
