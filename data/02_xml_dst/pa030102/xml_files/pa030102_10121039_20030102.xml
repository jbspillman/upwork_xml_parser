<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor. The endothelin (ET) ET-A and ET-B receptor subtypes are found, inter alia, in human lung, predominantly in airway smooth muscle, and vascular smooth muscle and, to a lesser extent nerves (see, e.g., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol: 26(2): 168-171, 1999). ET-1, ET-2, ET-3 and ET-B have been shown to cause bronchoconstriction (see, e.g., European Journal of Pharmacology: 191; 319-328, 1990). Patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, which is a disorder of chronic pulmonary inflammation), have been shown to have elevated levels of sputum ET-1 (see, e.g., European Respiratory Journal: 13(6); 1288-1292, 1999). Additionally, plasma levels of ET-1 are elevated in COPD patients during attacks (see, e.g., Chinese Journal of Tuberculosis: 16(5); 287-289, 1993). COPD patients additionally excrete higher amounts of ET-1 compared to healthy subjects (see e.g., Respiration: 61(5); 263-268, 1994). As reported by C. Hogg et al., <highlight><italic>Am. J. Respir. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>Vol. 23, pp.404-410 (2000) ET-A antagonists have demonstrated an anti-inflammatory profile on leukocyte driven inflammation. Accordingly, molecules that prevent or inhibit the production of ET can be expected to be useful to prevent and treat disorders of chronic or acute pulmonary inflammation such as COPD and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Endothelin antagonists, which are compounds capable, inter alia, of inhibiting the binding of endothelin peptides to endothelin receptors, are useful in the treatment of endothelin-related disorders. While certain such compounds have been described as having utility in the treatment of hypertension, the present invention provides a method employing these compounds specifically for the treatment of chronic or acute pulmonary inflammation. </paragraph>
