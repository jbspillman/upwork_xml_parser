<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Recently, DVD (digital versatile disk) has begun to be spread as a video title medium such as a movie for entertainment at home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Movie delivery companies are producing and delivering not only the conventional home video tapes but also DVD medium titles. Ordinary users purchase a home DVD player and can appreciate movies recorded on the DVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A DVD-R (DVD-Recordable), compatible with this DVD, is a writable optical disc on which a user can record video and audio information the user has. Production of a home video camera using the DVD-R as a recording medium is expected. However, in order to assure compatibility with the DVD player, a DVD-R disc should be subjected to a record finalization processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> explain the finalization processing. In the figures, the left side corresponds to an inner track and the right side corresponds to an outer track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, prior to the finalization, there are a lead-in/control data zone which has been recorded already during DVD-R production and a user data zone where a video/audio data of a user is recorded. After the finalization is performed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the disc area is divided into a lead-in zone, the lead-in/control data zone, a control information zone, the user data zone, and a lead-out zone in this order from the disc center toward the outer circumference. That is, the lead-in zone, the control information data, and the lead-out zone are recorded by the finalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The lead-out zone (A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) has a track width not smaller than 2 mm in case of a disc having a diameter of 8 cm but should be up to the position of 7 cm diameter as the smallest. When the data recorded by a user is small, i.e., when the user data zone has a small width, the lead-out zone becomes greater and it takes more time to write a predetermined data into the lead-out zone, thereby increasing the finalization time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that as an apparatus using the DVD-R, for example, there is one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,472. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> No consideration is taken in the home video camera for mounting a DVD-R drive, and when user has photographed for a small time and performs finalization without recognizing the time required for the finalization, the finalization takes a plenty of time, and the user should wait for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> While finalization is performed, a recording medium cannot be taken out. Accordingly, as the finalization processing takes more time, the user need to wait more time before starting recording on a new medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, normally, data is written into the area having no data recorded in the finalization processing. Accordingly, as the imaging time becomes shorter, the vacant area becomes greater, and more data should be written into the area upon finalization, increasing the wait time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Because of the aforementioned, when finalization processing is performed after a short photographing time, the user should wait for a long time until replacing the recording medium with a new one, photographing, and recording start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to reduce the wait time for the finalization processing, so that a user can rapidly start recording on a new recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the aforementioned object, according to the present invention, finalization specified by a user is not performed unconditionally. More specifically, a predetermined condition is provided for performing the finalization and if the condition is not satisfied, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> And when the condition is satisfied, the finalization is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The predetermined condition may be predetermined time as a processing time for the finalization and if more than the predetermined time is required for finalization, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the aforementioned predetermined time may be decided according to remaining power which can be supplied from the battery to the information recording apparatus or may be decided statistically by checking how much time users can wait without feeling illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, an information recording apparatus according to the present invention for recording information on a writable information recording medium comprises: recording means for recording information onto the recording medium; finalization means for performing finalization of the recording medium; decision means for deciding whether to perform the finalization by the finalization means; and control means for controlling the information recording apparatus and when the decision means decides negative, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, the information recording apparatus according to the present invention, further comprises: finalization time estimation means for estimating a time required for the finalization; and time comparison means for comparing a time estimated by the finalization time estimation means to a predetermined time; and when the time required for the finalization time is decided to be greater than the predetermined time by the time comparison means, the decision means results in positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the decision results is No, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the information recording apparatus further comprises a battery for supplying power to the information recording apparatus; and operation time estimation means for estimating a time that the information recording apparatus can be operated by the battery; wherein the predetermined time is set within a range of the operable time estimated by the operation time estimation means. Accordingly, the decision results in positive and the finalization is performed. Alternatively, by detecting the power quantity that can be supplied from the battery to the information recording/reproduction apparatus, the finalization is performed when the detected power quantity is equal to or greater than a predetermined power quantity. On the contrary, when the power quantity detected is smaller than the predetermined power quantity, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, in the information recording apparatus, the decision means includes: remaining quantity detection means for detecting remaining data quantity recordable on the recording medium; and comparison means for comparing the data quantity detected by the remaining quantity detection means with a predetermined data quantity; wherein if the data quantity detected by the remaining quantity detection means exceeds the predetermined data quantity, then the decision means results in No. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Since the decision result is No, the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, the information recording apparatus further comprises: remaining quantity detection means for detecting remaining data quantity recordable on the recording medium, wherein the finalization time estimation means estimate a time required for the finalization according to data quantity detected by the remaining quantity detection means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, the information recording apparatus according to the present invention further comprises: notification means and when the finalization is not performed, the notification means notifies that the finalization is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a condition is provided for deciding whether to perform the finalization and when the condition is not satisfied, that is displayed by the notification means and a display processing circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that even when that the condition is not satisfied is displayed, if a user wants to perform the finalization and specifies the finalization, by the user input processing circuit, the control of finalization may be modified so as to force to perform the finalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in order to achieve the aforementioned object, in the information recording apparatus according to the present invention, the finalization time estimation means estimates the time required for the finalization as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>1&minus;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>2)/<highlight><italic>S</italic></highlight>1&plus;<highlight><italic>P</italic></highlight>1 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> wherein T is a time required for the finalization; D1 is a recordable capacity of the recording medium; D2 is a recorded capacity of the recording medium; S1 is processing speed (including the finalization speed) of the information recording apparatus; and P1 is a processing time overhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that control of the aforementioned processing blocks and means or condition decision is performed by the system control circuit. However, it is also possible to provide a processing circuit for control of the processing blocks and means or the condition decision separately from the system control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Here, the finalization is performed to a recording medium having information (including audio and video information) so as to be reproduced in a reproduction apparatus.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> wherein D1 represents the disc capacity <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>; D2 represents the recorded capacity <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; and S1 represents finalization speed of the drive stored in the drive information of the setting value region <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Overhead portion (P1) of the processing time is involved in the equation 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing finalization control executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. When the finalization processing is requested by the user, this processing flow is executed. In step <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the finalization processing time T is calculated. In step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the processing time T exceeds a predetermined time (allowed time) T0. If No, i.e. T is not greater than T, then control is passed to step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, where control required for the finalization processing is performed. If Yes, i.e. T is greater than T, then control is passed to step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, where a warning message is displayed to the user by the display device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and enters a wait state for user confirmation. The finalization processing is terminated after execution of the aforementioned processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned case, finalization is denied if the finalization processing time exceeds the allowed time TO. However, only for the skilful user who knows details of the finalization processing, a part of the user setting region <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be modifiable by operation via the user input means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to force to perform the finalization processing. For this, the aforementioned user setting value region <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a flag indicating a skilful user in a region for setting a value for finalization, which are referred by the program executed by the system control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the video camera automatically determines whether the finalization is to be performed or not for the currently installed disk, and when the finalization is not appropriate, it is possible to prohibit the finalization processing. This prevents performing finalization processing by a careless mistake of the user and waiting for the next take. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a configuration of the second embodiment of the present invention. Like components are denoted by like reference symbols. The processing time estimation means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment is replaced by remaining quantity detection means <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The video/audio recording/reproduction processing is identical to that in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The system control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> controls finalization processing in cooperation with the remaining quantity detection means <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The system control means could be configured in the same configuration to that of the first embodiment. In this embodiment, the finalization processing is prohibited when the remaining quantity exceeds a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing finalization control in the second embodiment. In step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a disc remaining quantity R is calculated. Step <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> determines whether the disc remaining quantity R exceeds a predetermined value R0. If No (R does not exceed the value R0), control is passed to step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, where control is performed to execute finalization. If Yes (R exceeds the R0), a warning is displayed in step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for waiting for confirmation by the user. The finalization processing is terminated after execution of the aforementioned processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Calculation of the remaining quantity R is performed as explained in the first embodiment. That is the system control means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> manages the disc capacity D1 and the recorded quantity D2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Moreover, for skillful users having a sufficient operation knowledge, it is possible to provide a set value R0 modification method so as to force to perform finalization in the same manner mentioned in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation will be given on a third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an information recording/reproduction apparatus <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for performing information recording and reproduction. Various signals detected by an optical pickup <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> are supplied to a servo signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> and an information signal reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> in a signal processing circuit. The servo signal generation circuit generates a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal suitable for each optical disc <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> from the supplied detection signals. In accordance with these error signals, an actuator drive circuit <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> drives an objective lens actuator in the optical pickup <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> to adjust the position of the objective lens. Moreover, in the information signal reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, the detected signal is used to reproduce an information signal recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and the information signal is output to an information signal output terminal <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>. Portions of the signals generated and reproduced by the servo signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> and information signal reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> are supplied to a system control circuit <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a record information, optically taken and converted into an electric signal in a camera signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight>, is supplied to a record information signal conversion circuit <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. In the record information signal conversion circuit <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the electric signal is converted into a record signal, which is supplied to a system control circuit <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> to drive a laser light circuit <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and to record the record signal on the optical disc <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. An access control circuit <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and a spindle motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> are connected to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the former controlling the access direction and position of the optical pickup <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> and the latter controlling a spindle motor <highlight><bold>927</bold></highlight> for the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The finalization processing is performed according to control by the system control circuit <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> onto the optical disc <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> via the laser light source turning-on circuit <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and the optical pickup <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the decision whether to perform the finalization processing is performed by the system control circuit <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that when a user controls the aforementioned information recording/reproduction apparatus, the user operates the user input processing circuit <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight>. Processing states of the information recording/reproduction apparatus may be displayed on a display unit included in a display processing circuit <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>. Especially in case of the information recording/reproduction apparatus recording information obtained from the camera signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal screen such as an LCD can be provided in the display processing circuit <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling display and monitoring of video/audio information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the display processing circuit <highlight><bold>852</bold></highlight> may display and monitor record information or information which is recorded onto the optical disc by receiving a signal from the information signal reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> or information reproduced from the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The information recording/reproduction apparatus <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is connected to a battery <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> from which power is supplied and can be used as a portable type. Here, instead of connecting to the battery <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to connect a domestic AC power source by providing a power source circuit for that. In this case, the apparatus is used as a stationary type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the aforementioned case, a video/audio signal from the camera signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight> is provided as an input source. However, it is also possible to provide another signal source and its output signal is used as an input signal to be recorded. Alternatively, it is also possible to provide a signal input terminal and an external signal supplied from outside through the terminal may be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> show warning message notified to the user displayed in step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. That is, finalization takes a plenty of time and a user should wait for a long time if the finalization is performed unconditionally. Moreover, when power is supplied from a battery, if power supply runs out during a finalization processing, the finalization fails and there is a worst case that the optical disc cannot be reproduced. Thus, the messages of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> warn the user that the finalization takes a long time and asks the user to perform finalization even it takes a plenty of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a message displayed in step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment. That is, it is warned that unrecorded data capacity is large and the message also asks the user to confirm finalization is really required. This message, like the message in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, can prevent the user from waiting for a long time by performing the finalization processing. Furthermore, if the finalization is performed, any more information cannot be written. If the finalization processing is performed by a careless operation, the optical disc cannot be used for recording any more. Accordingly, the message of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> can prevent finalization by an incorrect operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> are only examples and it is possible to use various message contents, design, and display ways, including a message where the user can select processes related to the finalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For an example, it is possible to ask the user whether to force to perform finalization: &ldquo;Finalization forced to be performed&quest; YES/NO&rdquo;, and if YES is selected, the finalization is forced to be performed. In this case, the condition setting may be modified so as to be able to perform the finalization or the process is jumped to step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> for performing the finalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while explanation has been given on a case that the optical disc is a DVD-R in the embodiments, the present invention is not limited to this but can be applied to a recording medium capable of recording with a higher density than a CD or DVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiments, the video camera automatically decides whether to perform the finalization processing according to a disc remaining capacity and can prevent a case that the user erroneously performs finalization and waits for a long time until the next take can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the aforementioned predetermined time can be decided according to the power quantity that can be supplied from the battery to the information recording device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The predetermined time may also be decided statistically by testing a plurality of users when they feel that the waiting time is long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in the aforementioned embodiments, the decision whether to perform the finalization is made according to an electric power quantity and a comparison of a non-recorded capacity of a recording medium and a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> However, instead of comparing the time values, it is also possible to decide whether to perform the finalization according to a comparison of an electric power quantity and a non-recorded capacity of the recording medium with respective predetermined values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> For an example, a time is calculated from a power quantity supplied from a battery and the time is compared to a predetermined time. If the time obtained from the power quantity supplied from the battery is greater than the predetermined time, the finalization is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> However, instead of calculating time from the power quantity from the battery, it is possible to compare the power quantity supplied from the battery with a predetermined power quantity. If the former is greater than the latter, the finalization is performed. In this case, the power supply required for finalization is assured and there is no danger of finalization failure due to shortage of power from the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the respective processors, control of means, or conditional decisions in the aforementioned embodiments are performed by the system control circuit. However, it is also possible to provide a separate processing circuit for the respective processors, control of means, and conditional decision without using the system control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> According to the aforementioned embodiments, the video camera automatically recognizes a recorded state and can decide whether the finalization is possible. For example, there is no danger that the finalization is performed by an erroneous operation by the user and the user should wait for a long time until the user can again take video. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce the wait time when the finalization is performed and can soon start recording/photographing on a new medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The present invention can prevent a careless execution of the finalization processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
