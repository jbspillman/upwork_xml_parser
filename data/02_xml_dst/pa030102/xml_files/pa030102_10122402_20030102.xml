<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a layout design system of semiconductor integrated circuits facilitating an automatic selection of a wiring pattern by use of CAD, and more particularly to a layout design system of semiconductor integrated circuits for designing a terminal layout of an oblique wiring pattern, a layout design method, and a layout design program. The present invention further relates to a manufacturing method of semiconductor integrated circuits using the layout design system, layout design method and layout design program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Progress of LSI technologies makes the circuit scale larger, and this causes an increase in an amount of logic design computations for the circuit. Accordingly, as a logic design method capable of effectively utilizing computers, a logic design by use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) has been carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In designing interconnection of basic horizontal and vertical lines in the orthogonal coordinate system on CAD, horizontal and vertical lines often terminate at an intersection point of two or more orthogonal lines. When the horizontal lines and the vertical lines are formed in different levels in an actual semiconductor device, a via hole must be formed at the terminal portions of the metal lines to connect the horizontal and vertical lines three-dimensionally. As a matter of course, a connection pattern corresponding to the via hole must be defined at the terminal portions of the horizontal and vertical lines even in a layout by use of CAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Generally, if two basic orthogonal lines having an ordinary width W terminate at an intersection, wire terminating process is carried out to extend the ends of the orthogonal lines by W/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E illustrate an example of the wire terminating process of the basic orthogonal lines of the minimum width. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> horizontal line <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and a vertical line <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> intersect each other and terminate there. In a CAD system, only the intersection point at which the center lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> of the respective lines intersect each other is recognized as an intersection point <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The CAD system does not recognize the overlap of the two orthogonal lines at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When, in an actual semiconductor device, the horizontal line <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> is formed in a lower level and the vertical line <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is formed in an upper level, these two lines must be connected three-dimensionally by use of a via hole. As a matter of course, the CAD layout requires a connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> for connecting the two lines. The connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> has a bottom metal <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is a part of the end portion of the line <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> in the lower level, a top metal <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is a part of the end portion of the line <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> in the upper level, and an opening pattern (hereinafter, referred to as a &ldquo;cut pattern&rdquo; or simply as a &ldquo;cut&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> for connecting the top and bottom metals <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, since the CAD recognizes that the two lines intersect each other, it is possible to define the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> at the intersection point <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> on the layout. However, since an overlapped area where the horizontal and vertical lines <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> overlap is very small in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, even when the via hole is formed based on the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> in the actual semiconductor integrated circuit, the connections of the upper and lower levels and the via hole cannot be achieved successfully. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To overcome this problem, in the design system of the semiconductor integrated circuits, the ends of the horizontal and vertical lines <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> are respectively extended by W/2, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, so that the two lines completely overlap at their end portions. Then, wire terminating process is carried out so as to place the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> on the overlapped area, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> illustrates the shape of the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> at the end portion of the basic orthogonal lines at which they intersect each other, when viewed from above. Since the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> is placed on the intersection of the basic orthogonal lines, the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> has a square shape when viewed from above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference> is a side view of the shape of the connection pattern <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. The lower metal <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the upper metal <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are connected by the cut <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates another example of wire terminating process of two orthogonal lines having wide widths. In this case, the two wider orthogonal lines intersect and terminate at the intersection point. These wider lines are special lines such as a power source line and a clock line, and subjected to a wire terminating process similarly to general signal lines. A connection pattern <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> is placed on an overlapped area where a wider horizontal line <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> and a wider vertical line <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> intersect. At this time, since the overlapped area is made wider, a plurality of cuts <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> are provided in one connection pattern. Also in this case, both of the horizontal and vertical lines <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> are extended by W/2, and a metal pattern completely including the connection pattern <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> having the plurality of cuts <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> is placed in the overlapped area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is easy for the CAD system to carry out the wire terminating process to design interconnection consisting of only basic orthogonal lines in the horizontal and vertical directions, as in the examples shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, as the configuration of semiconductor integrated circuits is made finer, higher precision is required in every respect including a manufacturing process and components of a semiconductor integrated circuit. Particularly, a delay component caused by an interconnection (or a wiring) significantly affects the performance of the integrated circuit as the integrated circuit is made finer. Therefore, it is an important subject how to reduce such a delay in the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Most of the delay components of the interconnection are caused by a line resistance. The most effective way to reduce the line resistance is to reduce a line length. Accordingly, it has been proposed to use oblique lines, in addition to the basic orthogonal lines extending in the horizontal and vertical directions, to reduce the distance between two points in a semiconductor circuit. There is also a proposal to design a circuit layout using oblique lines on CAD. In this case, as the lines including the oblique lines are made in the form of multi-level structure composed of a larger number of levels, for example, the shape and the forming process of via holes connecting basic orthogonal lines in a lower level and oblique lines in an upper level must be contrived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention have proposed in U.S patent application Ser. No. 09/338,593 a technique for greatly reducing a line resistance of oblique lines itself. This is achieved by setting the width and film thickness of the oblique line to 2&frac12; times as large as those of the basic orthogonal lines. In this gazette, a technology for fully securing a cut area by contriving the shape of a via hole connecting metal lines of different levels is also proposed. In order to realize a high-speed operation of an integrated circuit, the inventors also proposed a tree-type clock supply line path comprised of a combination of oblique lines and the basic orthogonal lines. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a line structure using the oblique lines. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, considered is the line structure having a horizontal first-level metal line <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, a vertical second-level metal line <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, a horizontal third-level metal line <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, an oblique fourth-level metal line <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, and a fifth-level metal line <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the fourth-level metal line <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. When the first-level metal line <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, the second-level metal line <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> and the third-level metal line <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> have a line width W, respectively, the fourth-level metal line <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and the fifth-level metal line <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> have a line width of 2&frac12;W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention have proposed a wire terminating process method for lines on a layout in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/771,050 when oblique lines are used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C illustrate the wire terminating process for an oblique line. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, when a horizontal line <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> of a minimum line width extending in the horizontal direction is generated and an oblique line <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight> having a line width 2 times as wide as that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> and extending at an oblique angle relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> is generated, a cut <highlight><bold>947</bold></highlight> is provided. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a drawing when the cut <highlight><bold>947</bold></highlight> is viewed from above, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> is a drawing when the cut <highlight><bold>947</bold></highlight> is viewed laterally. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C illustrate an intersection structure of a line with a minimum line width in the oblique line. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, when a horizontal line <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> is generated in a lower level and an oblique line <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight> is generated in an upper level, a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>945</bold></highlight> is provided. At this time, a wire terminating process so as to delete a metal at a shaded area is carried out. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is a drawing when the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>945</bold></highlight> is viewed from above, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> is a drawing when the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>945</bold></highlight> is viewed laterally. At this time, the connection pattern <highlight><bold>945</bold></highlight> has an upper metal portion <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a parallelogram shape and a lower metal portion <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a rectangular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the line layout system, there has been one basic VIA shape using the line for each technology. Alternatively, a large VIA using one basic VIA shape (for example, a rectangular shape is typical) in plural has been defined or automatically generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, in the line layout method using an oblique line, a wide line space is consumed when a line is bent in the same line level, and hence there has been a problem that a degree of line integration is lowered and a data amount in a mask generation operation increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in consideration for various line layout methods, the necessity to selectively perform an optional VIA in accordance with a line pattern and to perform a wire terminating process suitable for the respective VIA shapes has been arisen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> (a) First, in step S<highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, it is decided via the input unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whether a VIA applicable to all line directions used, which includes an octagonal VIA, a circular VIA and the like, can be employed. When the lines of 0&deg;, 90&deg;, 45&deg; and 135&deg; series are used and the octagonal VIA can be used, the VIA pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C is selected in step S<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and the procedure is completed. In step S<highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, when the octagonal VIS is not used, the procedure advances to step S<highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the present invention, the line processing can be performed smoothly by preparing the technology database storage unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> before the line processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In addition, in this embodiment of the present invention, it is decided in the optimum VIA selection module <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>whether the octagonal VIA is used or not. It may be decided prior to the preparation of the line route whether the octagonal VIA is used or not. For example, when the technology database storage unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is prepared in step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it is possible to allow the technology database storage unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to decide whether the octagonal VIA is used or not. In this case, since the number of the wire terminating process patterns registered in the technology database storage unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be reduced, the line processing can be performed more smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is possible to provide a layout design system and a layout design method of a semiconductor integrated circuit capable of selecting a line layout method using a VIA having an optional shape speedily and effectively, in an actual line processing in which various line widths and line intersection conditions occur. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">First Embodiment of Layout Design Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of a layout design method, an embodiment of a layout design method in a case where a rectangular VIA is used in lines formed in different levels will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> is a plan view showing a line layout prepared on CAD by the layout design method according to the first embodiment. First, a horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a minimum width, which extends horizontally, is generated in a lower level. Subsequently, an oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with a line width 2&frac12; times as wide as that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which extends at an oblique angle (an angle of 45&deg; in the first embodiment) relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is generated in an upper level. As a matter of course, an oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extending obliquely at an angle symmetrical to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, that is, an angle of 135&quest; relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, may be generated. An intersection point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> exists at an intersection of a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An end portion of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> terminates at a point apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a length 2<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>/2 times as long as the line width of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An end portion of the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> terminates at a point apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a length &frac12; times as long as the line width of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> overlaps a terminal end of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and forms an overlapped area. In this overlapped area, a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for connecting the horizontal and oblique lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is set at the intersection point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This connection pattern is usually called a via (VIA), and corresponds to a via hole of an actual semiconductor integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the layout design method according to the first embodiment, a deletion of a redundancy portion shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> is carried out. In other words, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the shaded area <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is deleted in the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, the shape after the wire terminating process can be obtained, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Shapes of an upper level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lower level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are not limited to the square shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, and the shapes thereof may be a rectangular shape. A shape in which apexes of the rectangular metal area are coincident with the edges in the longitudinal direction and in the width direction of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be adopted. Otherwise, the metal area may have a fringe wider than the line widths of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, the upper level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> uses a square area at the end portion of the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the lower level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>uses a square area at the end portion of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A cut <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is set at the overlapped area of the upper and lower level metals <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15D and 15E</cross-reference> are a top view and a sectional view which define the shape of the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A with EDA (placement and routing tool). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>D, the innermost square with a cross mark in the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is the cut pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. One side of the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a line width equal to that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a diagonal line thereof has a length 2 times as long as that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The cut pattern expresses a cut of a via hole in which a high melting point metal such as doped polysilicon, tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), or a connection conductive metal such as silicide of the above materials (WSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, MoSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, TiSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is buried to connect the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in an actual semiconductor integrated circuit. Hereinafter, the cut pattern on the layout is simply referred to as a cut. Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>E, in the lower and upper levels, the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has metals with a line width equal to that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the upper and lower level metals <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected by the cut <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The cut <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is completely blocked by the upper level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. With this constitution, it is possible to prevent the lower level metal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from melting during a high temperature processing in an actual processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A first feature of the layout design method of the pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>E is that the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> overlap fully at their terminal ends, and there is no projection protruding from a contour of each line. Since there is no portion protruding from the contour of each line, an increase in coupling capacitance between the lines adjacent to each other and an adverse influence on a substrate capacitance hardly exist. Moreover, there is no waste of line resources in the oblique line at all. Particularly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C, a</cross-reference> line can be generated close to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> because of inexistence of the projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A second feature of the layout design method of the pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>E is that the connection pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be formed to be rectangular mainly. Drawing using the orthogonal line on the same mask requires a very small data amount compared to the case where combinations of oblique lines other than the orthogonal lines each intersecting at a right angle, such as a parallelogram and a lozenge, are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, this layout design method can prevent melting of the lower level metal in the semiconductor integrated circuit to be manufactured. In addition, the oblique line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as the upper level and the horizontal line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the lower level are connected to each other securely. Since the oblique line is used, a speed of a signal arrival to a destination point (for example, a flip-flop) can be made faster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> This layout design method further enhances a degree of line integration compared to the wire terminating process method for lines in which the oblique lines are included, and thus it is possible to provide the layout design method capable of reducing a chip size. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment of Layout Design Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the layout design method, an embodiment of the layout design method in which a rectangular VIA is used in lines of different levels and, particularly, an oblique line has a wider width will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A line layout will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A, a</cross-reference> horizontal line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extending horizontally (in a third level) and a vertical line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are generated in a lower level (a second level). Next, an oblique line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with a wider width, which extends obliquely at an angle unperpendicularly relative to the horizontal and vertical lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is generated in an upper level (a forth level). Terminal ends of the horizontal, vertical and oblique lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are coincident with each other, and a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is set at this portion. In this case, the shaded area <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is deleted, and the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B, a</cross-reference> horizontal line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a horizontal line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extending horizontally (in a forth level) are generated in the lower level (a third level). Next, an oblique line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with a wider width, which extends obliquely at an angle unperpendicularly relative to the horizontal lines <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is generated in the upper level. In this case, the shaded area <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is deleted, and a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is set. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>B, the connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be set at the portion where the terminal ends of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the oblique line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> overlap, and the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be set at the portion where the terminal ends of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the oblique line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> overlap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C, a</cross-reference> horizontal line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extending horizontally is generated in the lower level. Next, an oblique line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with a wider width, which extends obliquely at an angle unperpendicularly relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is generated in the upper level. The terminal ends of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are coincident with each other, and a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is set at this portion. In this case, the shaded area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is deleted, and the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D, a</cross-reference> horizontal line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a horizontal line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which extend horizontally (in a forth level) are generated in the lower level (a third level).

In this case, the shaded area <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is deleted, and a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is set. Connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are set at the portion where the horizontal line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the oblique line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> overlap, and connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are set at the portion where the horizontal line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the oblique line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> overlap. In addition, in accordance with the line width of the oblique line <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>may be set at the portion that is a middle position between the connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and at the position that is a middle position between the connection patterns (via) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, respectively.

A terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> overlaps a terminal end of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, thus forming an overlapped area. In this overlapped area, a turn via <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> connecting the horizontal line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is set at the intersection point <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the layout design method according to the third embodiment, a deletion of a redundancy portion is performed.

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A first feature of the layout design method of the pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference> is that the horizontal line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> fully overlap in their terminal ends, and there is no projection protruding from a contour of each line. Since there is no portion protruding from the contour of each line, an increase in coupling capacitance between the lines adjacent to each other and an adverse influence on a substrate capacitance hardly exist. Moreover, there is no waste of line resources in the oblique line at all. Particularly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B, a</cross-reference> line can be generated close to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> because of inexistence of the projection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</cross-reference> shows a line layout prepared on CAD by the layout design method according to the seventh embodiment. First, a horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> with a minimum line width, which extends horizontally, is generated. Subsequently, an oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> with a different line width from that of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, which extends obliquely at an angle unperpendicularly relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, is generated. An intersection point <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> exists at an intersection of a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. An end portion of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> terminates at a position apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> by a length &frac12; times as long as the line width of the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. An end portion of the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> terminates at a position apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> by a length &frac12; times as long as the line width of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. A terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> overlaps a terminal end of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and forms an overlapped area. In this overlapped area, a turn via <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> connecting the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is set at the intersection point <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the shaded area <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is deleted in the terminal end of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. Thus, the turn via <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> forms an octagon. As a result, the shape after the wire terminating process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</cross-reference> shows a line layout prepared on CAD by the layout design method according to the eighth embodiment. First, a vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> with a minimum line width, which extends vertically, is generated in a second level. Subsequently, a horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> with a minimum line width, which extends horizontally, is generated in a third level. Next, an oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> with a line width different from the minimum line width, which extends obliquely at an angle unperpendicularly relative to the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, is generated in a fourth level. An intersection point <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> exists at an intersection of a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and a longitudinal center line <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> terminate at a position apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> by a length &frac12; times as long as the line width of the oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> terminates at a position apart from the intersection point <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> by a length &frac12; times as long as the line width of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. A terminal end of the oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> overlaps terminal ends of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and forms an overlapped area. In this overlapped area, a connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> connecting the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is set at the intersection point <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in the terminal ends of the horizontal line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, the vertical line <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, the shaded area <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is deleted. Thus, the connection pattern (via) <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> forms an octagon. As a result, the shape after the wire terminating process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As described in the seventh and eighth embodiments, the octagonal via can be used in the lines of all of the patterns. In the octagonal via, there is no waste of the line recourses at all compared to the rectangular via, lozenge via and parallelogram via, and the lines can be connected by a via having a minimum area. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment of Method of Manufacturing Semiconductor Integrated Circuit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> An example in which an oblique line structure is formed on a semiconductor substrate and a semiconductor integrated circuit is manufactured by use of a mask manufactured based on a layout by the above described automatic design method will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, an oblique line structure in which an oblique line <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> and a basic orthogonal line including a horizontal line <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> are intermingled on a transistor area <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of a cell (semiconductor integrated circuit) <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is schematically shown, and a detailed line structure and the like are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> To prepare this oblique line structure, design data of a mask pattern generated by the automatic design method of the foregoing line pattern is input to a computer of a pattern generator such as an optical exposure apparatus, an electron beam exposure apparatus and an X-ray exposure apparatus, and a predetermined exposure mask (reticle) may be drawn by use of the design data. The reticle is prepared by ten to several tens or more in number according to manufacturing processes and contents of the semiconductor integrated circuit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C show an exposure mask set <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> which shows three reticles extracted from a part of such a plurality of reticle sets. For convenience of descriptions, a part of the mask pattern of each mask is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The mask set <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C includes a first mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>A, a second mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>B and a third mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>C. In the first mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>A, an opaque pattern (light shielding area) <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>A serving as a horizontal line pattern (first level line) <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>A extending horizontally is formed of a chromium (Cr) film or the like on a mask substrate such as quartz glass. In an opaque area, the second mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>B has an opening portion <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>B serving as a cut pattern of a via hole. The third mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>C has an opaque pattern composed of an oblique line pattern <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>C extending obliquely at an angle of 45&deg; or 135&deg; relative to the horizontal line pattern.

<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> It is possible to realize the oblique line structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> by use of a series of mask sets (reticle set) including the mask set <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C. To form transistor portions and other line structures, though other mask sets are, as a matter of course, necessary, descriptions thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, an oblique line structure <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes: a basic orthogonal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> extending horizontally or vertically, which is disposed on a first level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> son a Si substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>; a second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> disposed on the basic orthogonal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>; an oblique line <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> disposed on the second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, which is composed of oblique lines extending obliquely at an angle of 45&deg; or 135&deg; relative to the basic orthogonal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>; a via hole <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> formed so as to penetrate through an insulating film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, which connects the basic orthogonal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the oblique line <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>; and a connection conductive member buried in the via hole. A passivation film or a third level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight> is formed on the oblique line <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> A connection conductive portion is formed by the via hole <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and the connection conductive member. The connection conductive portion can be formed at one or more positions including at least an intersection point of a longitudinal center line of the basic orthogonal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and a longitudinal center line of the oblique line <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Note that the technical terms &ldquo;the first level interlayer insulating film&rdquo; and &ldquo;the second level interlayer insulating film&rdquo; are adopted in consideration for convenience for explanations. Actually, it will do that another level interlayer insulating film and a metallic line film disposed under the first and second level interlayer insulating films are included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>H, processes for forming the oblique line structure <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> (a) As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>A, by sputtering or vacuum evaporation, a first-level metallic film <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> such as Al alloy is first deposited on the Si substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> covered with the first level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> such as an oxide film (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The first-level metallic film <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is deposited by sputtering and vacuum evaporation. Furthermore, a positive-type resist <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> is spin-coated to cover the first-level metallic film <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> (b) Next, the Si substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is disposed on an exposure stage of an exposure apparatus such as a stepper, and the positive-type resist <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> is exposed and developed by use of the reticle (first mask) <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>A having the horizontal line pattern. As a result, the resist in a portion corresponding to the horizontal line pattern remains as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> (c) Using the photoresist pattern in this state as a mask, the first-level metallic film <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is etched by reactive ion etching (RIE), and then the resist is removed. Thus, the horizontal line <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> (d) Next, the second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> such as an oxide film, Phosphosilicate-glass (PSG) and Boro-phosphate-silicate-glass (BPSG) is deposited on the horizontal line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> by CVD or the like. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>D, the second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is covered with a positive-type resist <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. When a negative-type resist <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is used in stead of the positive-type resist, it is natural that the second mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</cross-reference> is a mask in which black and white turn over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> (e) The Si substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is introduced onto the exposure stage of the exposure apparatus again, and a cut pattern is exposed and developed by use of the second mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30E, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern in which only a resist corresponding to an opening pattern of the cut is removed is completed. With this photoresist as a mask, a via hole <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is formed in the second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> by etching such as RIE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> (f) Thereafter, the positive-type resist <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is removed, and the via hole <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is filled with the connection conductive member such as tungsten (W) by use of a CVD method, a sputtering method and a vacuum evaporation method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30F</cross-reference>. Thereafter, the surface of the resultant structure is flattened by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> (g) As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30G, a</cross-reference> second-level metallic film <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> such as Al alloy is formed on the second level interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the connection conductive member by sputtering and vacuum evaporation. Moreover, a positive-type resist <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is spin-coated thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> (h) The oblique line pattern is exposed and developed by use of the third mask <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>C in the stepper. As a result, a portion of the resist corresponding to the oblique line pattern remains. In this state, the second-level metallic film <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> is etched by use of RIE, and the oblique line structure <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30H</cross-reference>. Thereafter, a passivation film or a third level interlayer insulating film such as an oxide film, PSG, BPSG, a nitride film (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), a polyimide film or the like is deposited on the oblique line structure <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> by use of the CVD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The example in which the first and second-level metallic films <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> are connected by the connection conductive member was described in the above. It is natural that the second-level metallic film and the third-level metallic film formed thereon may be connected, and the third-level metallic film and another metallic film formed thereon such as a fourth-level metallic film may be connected. Moreover, as described already, metallic films under the first-level metallic film <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> may exist, and it is natural that connections of these metallic films and the above metallic films are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In addition, although the method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit using the exposure mask set <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> was described, a method will do, in which a drawing apparatus is directly driven with the foregoing design data without using the exposure mask set <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, and drawing is performed directly onto a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is easily understood from the purpose of the present invention that at least one of the first and second-level metallic films <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> may be a line other than Al alloy, such as Damascus line of copper (Cu). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Concrete examples of the semiconductor integrated circuit using the layout design method of the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> As a result of adopting such a branch structure, trees which are constituted by oblique lines and symmetrical with the center C of the semiconductor chip are set up all over the chip. Although illustrations are not made, basic orthogonal lines directly connected to the cell are formed in a level under the clock trees using the oblique lines alone, and end portions of the oblique lines constituting the clock trees are connected to the basic orthogonal lines as the lower level through the via hole based on the automatic design method of the foregoing terminal layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the clock tree using the oblique line, lines of the same branch class belong to the same level as a rule. Accordingly, all of the four oblique lines <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the fourth branch class belong to the same level. Lines which are in different branch classes but extend in the same direction may belong to the same level or may belong to different levels. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, the oblique lines <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third branch class and oblique lines <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>of a fifth branch class extending in the same direction as the oblique lines <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be formed in the same level or in different levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The greatest effect achieved by using such oblique lines is that a calculation to keep balance in designing load capacitance and the like is facilitated. In addition, it is possible to hold down variations of clock delay accompanied with process change. Moreover, levels of the same branch class are disposed in the same level, and the lines are made to be symmetrical. Thus, variations depending on the line level are eliminated, and delay of clocks between two points can be shortened while keeping balance for load capacitance for each branch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Although illustrations are not made, it is possible to narrow a line width based on a line delay calculation formula of Elmor as the branch class progresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> With such a constitution, it is possible to realize a semiconductor integrated circuit with high performance which suppresses the load capacitance, operates at a higher speed, and shows fewer variations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example of Second Semiconductor Integrated Circuit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32, a</cross-reference> second semiconductor integrated circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises: a main PLL <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> positioned in an end of the circuit, which supplies global clocks of comparatively low frequency (several hundreds MHz); a global clock line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> extending from the main PLL <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>; and a plurality of random blocks <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>B. Each random block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> comprises: a clock driver cell (Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) in the eighth embodiment) <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> connected to the global clock line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>; and clock tress constituted of oblique lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The main PPL <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> regulates phases of clocks with integrated circuit devices other than a semiconductor integrated circuit loading the PPL <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The global clocks that are basic clocks traversing the chip are supplied from the PPL <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to a circuit block or a random block in the chip. The circuit block and the random block are an aggregate of partial circuits divisionally prepared by the designer, which are composed of a plurality of logic circuit modules. The DLL <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> provided in each random block converts the global clocks of the comparatively low frequency to local clocks of a high frequency (several GHz), and supplies the high frequency clocks to the inside of the random block through a related clock tree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Although illustrations are not made, also in the second semiconductor integrated circuit, the clock tree of each block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is connected to the basic orthogonal line in the lower level through the via hole. Specifically, terminal ends of the oblique lines constituting the clock tree are surely connected to terminal ends of the basic orthogonal lines based on a line layout generated by the foregoing automatic design method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> As described above, as a LSI is fabricated to be more minute, resistivity and capacity of the line greatly affect a delay. In the collective synchronizing design of the chip, that is, the single clock design, to collectively synchronize the chip of 10 mm square, a speed of several hundred MHz is a limit. If a design more than several hundred MHz is desired, a thickness of the clock line must be set to several ten to several hundred times that of a standard signal line. This results in difficulty of manufacturing the semiconductor integrated circuit in terms of processes, and in difficulty of handling on CAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by transmitting the global clocks with the comparatively low frequency and by synchronizing each local block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> with a high frequency to be operated like the second semiconductor integrated circuit, a higher speed operation can be realized with the chip size. In addition, since the clock tree is constituted of only the symmetrical oblique lines, there is less delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Since each random block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is disposed on both sides of the global clock line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in the constitution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the DLL of each random block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> can be disposed at the end portion of the circuit, and hence a voltage supply is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, in a semiconductor integrated circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, a PLL <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is disposed at a corner of the circuit, and a global clock line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> for supplying global clocks lies obliquely. Usually, the global clock line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> for supplying the global clocks is apt to cause a delay. To remove the delay at this portion and to supply the global clocks to each random block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> quickly and approximately simultaneously, the global clock line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is made to lie obliquely up to the center of the chip, and DLLs <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the respective random blocks are disposed collectively at the center portion. Power is supplied to the DLLs <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> from a dedicated area pad (not shown) which is provided on the upper surface of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> By providing the global clock line <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> obliquely, a frequency itself of the global clocks can be raised, and a higher speed operation is possible. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Generally, a clock supply source of a mesh structure is resistant to process variations, and capable of reducing variations owing to a delay on the whole. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, since the clock mesh using the oblique lines is adopted, a delay shortening effect of the clock can be more achieved compared to a mesh using the horizontal and vertical basic orthogonal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Although illustrations are not made, in a lower level of the clock mesh constituted by the oblique lines, a basic orthogonal line level connected directly to the cell is provided.

Each DLL <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> converts the global clocks of a comparatively low frequency to local clocks of a high frequency (several GHz), and supplies high frequency clocks in the random block through the related clock mesh <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Although illustrations are not made, in each random block <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, a basic orthogonal lines connected to the cell are provided in a lower level of the clock mesh <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, the basic orthogonal lines are connected to the upper level through a via hole at a predetermined position based on a terminal layout generated by the foregoing automatic design method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Each block <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> allows the global clocks sent from the DDL <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to be synchronized at a high frequency, and supplies a signal to each site through the clock mesh of the-oblique lines which hardly show delay variations.
