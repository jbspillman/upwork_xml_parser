<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A flexible low profile delivery system for delivery of an expandable intracorporeal device, specifically, an endovascular graft, which has at least one belt circumferentially disposed about the device in a constraining configuration. The belt is released by a release member, such as a release wire, by retracting the wire from looped ends of the belt. Multiple belts can be used and can be released sequentially so as to control the order of release and placement of the endovascular graft. An outer protective sheath may be disposed about the endovascular graft while in a constrained state which must first be retracted or otherwise removed prior to release of the graft from a constrained state. The delivery system can be configured for delivery over a guiding device such as a guidewire. The delivery system can also be configured for delivery of bifurcated intracorporeal devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a system and method for the treatment of disorders of the vasculature. More specifically, a system and method for treatment of thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm and the like, which is a condition manifested by expansion and weakening of the aorta. Prior methods of treating aneurysms have consisted of invasive surgical methods with graft placement within the affected vessel as a reinforcing member of the artery. However, such a procedure requires a surgical cut down to access the vessel, which in turn can result in a catastrophic rupture of the aneurysm due to the decreased external pressure from the surrounding organs and tissues, which are moved during the procedure to gain access to the vessel. Accordingly, surgical procedures can have a high mortality rate due to the possibility of the rupture discussed above in addition to other factors. Other risk factors for surgical treatment of aortic aneurysms can include poor physical condition of the patient due to blood loss, anuria, and low blood pressure associated with the aortic abdominal aneurysm. An example of a surgical procedure is described in a book entitled <highlight><italic>Surgical Treatment of Aortic Aneurysms </italic></highlight>by Cooley published in 1986 by W.B. Saunders Company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Due to the inherent risks and complexities of surgical intervention, various attempts have been made to develop alternative methods for deployment of grafts within aortic aneurysms. One such method is the non-invasive technique of percutaneous delivery by a catheter-based system. Such a method is described in Lawrence, Jr. et al. in &ldquo;Percutaneous endovascular graft: experimental evaluation&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Radiology </italic></highlight>(May 1987). Lawrence described therein the use of a Gianturco stent as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,580,568. The stent is used to position a Dacron fabric graft within the vessel. The Dacron graft is compressed within the catheter and then deployed within the vessel to be treated. A similar procedure has also been described by Mirich et al. in &ldquo;Percutaneously placed endovascular grafts for aortic aneurysms: feasibility study,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Radiology </italic></highlight>(March 1989). Mirich describes therein a self-expanding metallic structure covered by a nylon fabric, with said structure being anchored by barbs at the proximal and distal ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the primary deficiencies of the existing percutaneous devices and methods has been that the grafts and the delivery systems used to deliver the grafts are relatively large in profile, often up to 24 French, and stiff in longitudinal bending. The large profile and relatively high bending stiffness of existing delivery systems makes delivery through the vessels of a patient difficult and can pose the risk of dissection or other trauma to the patient&apos;s vessels. In particular, the iliac arteries of a patient are often too narrow or irregular for the passage of existing percutaneous devices. Because of this, non-invasive percutaneous graft delivery for treatment of aortic aneurysm is contraindicated for many patients who would otherwise benefit from it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> What is needed is an endovascular graft and delivery system having a small outer diameter relative to existing systems and high flexibility to facilitate percutaneous delivery in patients who require such treatment. What is also needed is a delivery system for an endovascular graft that is simple, reliable and that can accurately and safely deploy an endovascular graft within a patient&apos;s body, lumen or vessel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed generally to a delivery system for delivery of an expandable intracorporeal device, specifically, an endovascular graft. Embodiments of the invention are directed to percutaneous non<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> invasive delivery of endovascular grafts which eliminate the need for a surgical cut-down in order to access the afflicted artery or other intracorporeal conduit of the patient being treated. Such a non-invasive delivery system and method result in shorter procedure duration, expedited recovery times and lower risk of complication. The flexible low profile properties of some embodiments of the invention also make percutaneous non-invasive procedures for delivery of endovascular grafts available to patient populations that may not otherwise have such treatment available. For example, patients with small anatomies or particularly tortuous vasculature may be contraindicated for procedures that involve the use of delivery systems that do not have the flexible or low profile characteristics of embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the delivery system has an elongate shaft with a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the elongate shaft includes a portion having an expandable intracorporeal device. An elongate belt support member is disposed adjacent a portion of the expandable intracorporeal device and a belt is secured to the belt support member and circumferentially disposed about the expandable intracorporeal device. The belt member constrains at least a portion of the expandable intracorporeal device. A release member releasably secures the belt in the constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a delivery system that has an elongate shaft with a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the elongate shaft has an elongate belt support member disposed adjacent a portion of the expandable intracorporeal device. A belt is secured to the belt support member and is circumferentially disposed about the expandable intracorporeal device. The belt has a configuration which constrains the expandable intracorporeal device and a release member releasably secures the belt in the constraining configuration. The belt may constrain any portion of the expandable intracorporeal device, such as a self-expanding portion of the expandable intracorporeal device. A self-expanding portion of the device may include a self-expanding member such as a tubular stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the invention, a plurality of belts are secured to various axial positions on the belt support member, are circumferentially disposed about the expandable intracorporeal device and have a configuration which constrains the expandable intracorporeal device. At least one release member releasably secures the belts in the constraining configuration. Each belt can be released by a single separate release member which engages each belt separately, or multiple belts can be released by a single release member. The order in which the belts are released can be determined by the axial position of the belts and the direction of movement of the release member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a delivery system for delivery of a self-expanding endovascular graft with a flexible tubular body portion and at least one self-expanding member secured to an end of the endovascular graft. The delivery system has an elongate shaft having a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the elongate shaft has an elongate belt support member disposed within the self-expanding member of the endovascular graft and a belt that is secured to the belt support member adjacent the self-expanding member. The belt is also circumferentially disposed about the self-expanding member and has a configuration that constrains the self-expanding member. A release wire releasably secures ends of the belt in the constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the invention includes a delivery system for delivery of an endovascular graft with a flexible tubular body portion and a plurality of self-expanding members secured to ends of the endovascular graft. The delivery system has an elongate shaft with a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the elongate shaft has an elongate guidewire tube disposed within the endovascular graft in a constrained state. A plurality of shape memory thin wire belts are secured to the guidewire tube respectively adjacent the self-expanding members. The belts are circumferentially disposed about the respective self-expanding members and have a configuration that constrains the respective self-expanding members. A first release wire releasably secures ends of the belts disposed about the self-expanding members at the proximal end of the endovascular graft in a constraining configuration. A second release wire releasably secures ends of the belts disposed about the self-expanding members at a distal end of the endovascular graft in the constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention also is directed to a method for deploying an expandable intracorporeal device within a patient&apos;s body. The method includes providing a delivery system for delivery of an expandable intracorporeal device including an elongate shaft having a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the elongate shaft has an elongate belt support member disposed adjacent a portion of the expandable intracorporeal device and a belt which is secured to the belt support member. The belt is circumferentially disposed about the expandable intracorporeal device and has a configuration that constrains the expandable intracorporeal device. A release member releasably secures the belt in the constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Next, the distal end of the delivery system is introduced into the patient&apos;s body and advanced to a desired site within the patient&apos;s body. The release member is then activated, releasing the belt from the constraining configuration. Optionally, the delivery system may also have an outer protective sheath disposed about the endovascular graft in a constrained state, the belt in its constraining configuration and at least a portion of the release wire disposed at the belt. In such an embodiment, the method of deployment of an expandable intracorporeal device also includes retraction of the outer protective sheath from the endovascular graft prior to activation of the release member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention directed to delivery of bifurcated intracorporeal device, an elongate shaft has a proximal section and a distal section. The distal section of the shaft has an elongate primary belt support member and at least one primary belt disposed on the primary belt support member. The primary belt support member is configured to be circumferentially disposed about a bifurcated intracorporeal device and at least partially constrain the device. A primary release member is configured to engage and releasably secure the primary belt in a constraining configuration. At least one elongate secondary belt support member is disposed adjacent the elongate primary belt support member. At least one secondary belt is disposed on the secondary belt support member. This at least one secondary belt is configured to be circumferentially disposed about a bifurcated intracorporeal device and at least partially constrain the device. A secondary release member is configured to engage and releasably secure the secondary belt in a constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a method for deploying a bifurcated intracorporeal device within a patient&apos;s body, a delivery system for delivery and deployment of a bifurcated intracorporeal device is provided. The delivery system includes an elongate shaft having a proximal section and a distal section. The bifurcated intracorporeal device is disposed on the distal section of the elongate shaft. The distal section of the elongate shaft also includes an elongate primary belt support member and at least one primary belt secured to the primary belt support member. The primary belt is configured to be circumferentially disposed about a bifurcated intracorporeal device and at least partially constrain the device. A primary release member engages and releasably secures the primary belt in the constraining configuration. The distal section of the elongate shaft also includes at least one elongate secondary belt support member disposed adjacent the elongate primary belt support member. At least one secondary belt is secured to the secondary belt support member and is configured to be circumferentially disposed about a bifurcated intracorporeal device to at least partially constrain the device. A secondary release member engages and releasably secures the secondary belt in a constraining configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The distal end of the delivery system is introduced into the patient&apos;s body and advanced to a desired site within the patient&apos;s body. The release members are then activated to release the belts from the constraining configuration and the device is deployed. Thereafter, the delivery system can be removed from the patient&apos;s body. In some embodiments of the invention, the secondary belt support member is detached and removed from the delivery system prior to withdrawal of the delivery system from the patient. In another embodiment, the secondary belt support member is displaced laterally towards the primary belt support member so as to be substantially parallel to the primary belt support member and enable withdrawal of the delivery system through an ipsilateral side of the bifurcated intracorporeal device.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has an elongate shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a proximal section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a distal section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a proximal end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The distal section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an elongate belt support member in the form of a guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent a portion of the expandable endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed within guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A plurality of belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are secured to the guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and are circumferentially disposed about portions of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the belts in a configuration that constrains the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. First and second release members <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> releasably secure belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in a constraining configuration as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a proximal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a distal end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a proximal inflatable cuff <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a distal inflatable cuff <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As defined herein, the proximal end of the elongate shaft is the end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> proximal to an operator of the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during use. The distal end of the elongate shaft is the end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that enters and extends into the patient&apos;s body. The proximal and distal directions for the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> loaded within the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as used herein are the same. This convention is used throughout the specification for the purposes of clarity, although other conventions are commonly used. For example, another useful convention defines the proximal end of an endovascular graft as that end of the graft that is proximal to the source of blood flow going into the graft. Such a convention is used in the previously discussed co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 09/133,978, although that convention is not adopted herein. </paragraph>

Typically, belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are made from solid ribbon or wire of a shape memory alloy such as nickel titanium or the like, although other metallic or polymeric materials are possible. Belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may also be made of braided metal filaments or braided or solid filaments of high strength synthetic fibers such as Dacron&reg;, Spectra or the like. An outside transverse cross section of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may range from about 0.002 to about 0.012 inch, specifically, about 0.004 to about 0.007 inch. The cross sections of belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may generally take on any shape, including rectangular (in the case of a ribbon), circular, elliptical, square, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In general, we have found that a ratio of a cross sectional area of the belts to a cross sectional area of the release members, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, of about 1:2 is useful to balance the relative strength and stiffness requirements. Other ratios, however, may also be used depending on the desired performance characteristics. </paragraph>

Standoff tubes <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> also prevent belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from applying other undesirable forces on portions of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that are constrained by the belts. Specifically, the standoff tubes <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> prevent the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from spreading the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, or portions thereof, at those locations where the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> extend radially through the self-expanding members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The standoff tubes <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> typically have a length substantially equal to a single wall thickness of the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The length of the standoff tubes <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may range from about 0.010 inch to about 0.030 inch.

The term &ldquo;circumferential extension&rdquo; as used with regard to extension of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is meant to encompass any extension of a belt in a circumferential direction. The belts may extend circumferentially a full 360 degrees, or any portion thereof. For example, belts or belt segments may extend partially about an endovascular device, and may be combined with other belts or belt segments that also partially extend circumferentially about an endovascular device. Typically, a plane formed by each of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> when in a constraining configuration is generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, of the distal section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

Single or multiple belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C may be deployed at various locations along guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as desired. In addition, the members comprising belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C are shown as a single line. However, belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C may be of a single- or multiple strand or filament design with various cross-sectional shapes as previously described. A single solid ribbon or wire is particularly useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C and 7D</cross-reference> are a single strand filament wrapped around guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and fixed thereon via any number of suitable techniques, such as gluing with adhesive, mechanical fixation, etc. Especially useful is fixing the belt with an ultraviolet-curable adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C may comprise two strand filaments each wrapped around guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that, for instance, belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C is a two-filament component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C includes belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, each of which, in the embodiments shown, is a loop of filament twisted upon itself to form a helix. Any number of twists may be imparted to arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to provide a relatively loose or relatively tight helix as desired. Typically the number of twists (with a single twist being defined as a single overlap of wire segment) in each belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> numbers from zero to about 50 or more; specifically, about two to about 10. The choice of material used for belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>C is an important factor in determining the optimum number of twists for each belt arm. Belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be formed into other configurations (e.g., braid, double helix, etc.) as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Disposed within the end loops of the belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are distal apertures or openings <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, respectively. During assembly of the delivery system, a release wire (such as wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is passed through each aperture <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> after the belt arms are wrapped around the graft self-expanding member, preferably in a circumferential groove as further described below. The release wire may also be disposed through any aperture created along the length of belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> by each helix twist, although the distal-most apertures <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The wire optionally may be welded, glued, or otherwise fixed to itself at discrete points or along all or any portion of belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, save their corresponding apertures <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. For instance, the belt arm wire may be glued or welded to itself at the overlap or twist points, such as points <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> shows an optional belt arm sleeve <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that may be used to enclose a portion of one or both belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or any of the other belt embodiments contemplated herein. Belt <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> being constrained or covered over a length thereof by a flexible sleeve or coating <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (or alternatively, a coil wrapping or by fixing the loop to itself by adhesives, welding, soldering, brazing, etc.). Sleeve or coating <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may optionally be shrink-wrapped, crimped, or otherwise configured to constrain or cover belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> therein. These fixation and sleeve features help to minimize the potential of belt arm untwisting and tend to close or block some or all of the helix apertures along the length except those through which the release wire are intended to pass. They can also provide greater structural and operational stability to the catheter system as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Belt arm sleeve <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be configured to have a transverse dimension that is sized to fit a twisted belt arm with fixed nodal points such as the belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference>. In order to accommodate such a twisted belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the inner diameter and outer diameter would be large relative to a transverse dimension of the wire material that forms the belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. However, the belt arm sleeve <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can also be only slightly larger in transverse dimension that the wire that forms the belt arm. For example, embodiments of belt arms that do not have twisted wires may have a sleeve <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that fits closely or tightly over two strands of wire forming a belt arm. The sleeve <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can cover substantially the entire length of such an untwisted belt arm from at least the guidewire tube to just proximal of the distal loop, such as distal loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The distal loop should remain exposed for engagement by a release wire. In such an embodiment, the sleeve covered portion of the belt arm may also be wrapped around and secured to the guidewire tube just as the unsleeved belt portion of the belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> is shown at <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>C. This type of low profile belt arm sleeve may also be used to cover twisted belt arm embodiments, although a slightly larger diameter sleeve would be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to impart a particular free resting angle to the belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to improve the reliability of the system and further reduce the possibility of the arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> interfering with other components of the prosthesis or delivery system. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> view shows belt arms <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> symmetrically disposed at an angle &agr; as measured from a horizontal plane <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. This angle &agr; may range from zero to 180 degrees. For example, one or both belt arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may lie along plane <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or they may rest in the configuration shown (&agr;&equals;45 degrees). Any known techniques may be used to impart a desired resting configuration to the system, such as, for example, cold working or shape-setting by way of an athermal phase transformation (in the case of shape memory alloys). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of a belt assembly similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, wherein like elements are shown with like reference numerals. An alternative embodiment of a release wire consisting of a branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</cross-reference>. The branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is configured to release belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at different times with a proximal withdrawal movement of the branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the direction of which is indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. Branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has a main portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a branch portion <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. Branch portion <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> is secured to main portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> by a solder joint <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The joint <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> could also be made by any other suitable means, such as welding, bonding with an epoxy, mechanically binding the joint, or the like. The embodiment of the branched release wire shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</cross-reference> consists of wire which is generally round in cross section. The wire of the branched release wire can have the same or similar material and mechanical properties to the wire of the release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> discussed above. Branch portion <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> engages first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A distal segment <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> has a length L indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> which extends distally from first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the distal end <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> of branch portion <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Main portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages the proximal belt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and has a distal segment <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> that extends distally from the proximal belt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to a distal end <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the main portion. The length L&prime; of the distal segment <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the main portion <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Length L of distal segment <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is greater than length L&prime; of distal segment <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. In this way, as the branched release wire is withdrawn proximally, proximal belt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is released first, first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is released second and second distal belt is released last. Such a branched release wire allows a wide variety of belt release timing with a single continuous withdrawal or movement of a proximal end (not shown) of the branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The proximal end of the branched release wire may be terminated and secured to a release wire handle or the like, as discussed herein with regard to other embodiments of release wires. The ability to deploy multiple release wires in a desired timing sequence with a single branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> gives the designer of the delivery system great flexibility and control over the deployment sequence while making the deployment of the belts simple and reliable for the operator of the delivery system. Although the branched release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has been shown with only a single branch, any number of branches or desired configuration could be used to achieve the deployment sequence required for a given embodiment of a delivery system. For example, a separate branch could be used for each belt in a multiple belt system, with varying distal segment length used to control the sequence of deployment. Also, multiple branched release wires, or the like, could be used in a single delivery system to achieve the desired results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A number of embodiments for the belt and belt arm components of the present invention are described herein. In general, however, we contemplate any belt or belt arm configuration in which the belt may be used to releasably hold or restrain an implant member in conjunction with a release member. The particular embodiments disclosed herein are not meant to be limiting, and other variations not explicitly disclosed herein, such as those in which multiple apertures (which may have varying shapes and sizes) are disposed along the belt length, those in which the belt or belt arm distal ends comprises a separate material or element that is affixed to the belt or belt arm, etc. are within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, various embodiments of the ends of the belts or belt arms taught herein may exist in any combination in a single delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> lie within circumferential grooves or channels <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, respectively, formed into the respective self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Grooves <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> prevent axial displacement of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> prior to activation or release of the releasable members <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, i.e., proximal retraction of the first and second release wires. Although grooves <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> are illustrated in the embodiment shown, other alternatives are possible to achieve the same or similar function of the grooves. For example, abutments extending slightly from the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on either side of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in their constraining configuration could prevent axial movement of the belts. A detachable adhesive or the like could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the release of end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> occurs when the distal end portions <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, respectively, pass from within the overlapped end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. If the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> move axially in response to movement of the release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> due to frictional forces imposed on the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> by the release wires, the point at which the distal ends of the release wires <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> pass from within the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> would vary depending on the amount of movement of the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> If the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> were to be axially displaced from their normal position relative to the distal ends of the release wires prior to deployment, the timing of the release of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> could be adversely affected. Thus, the prevention of axial displacement of the belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> during proximal retraction of the release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> facilitates accurate release of the belts by keeping the overlap joint of the belt looped end portions in a constant axial position during such retraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition, it may be desirable to keep belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> positioned at or near the general center of a given constrained self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so that the self-expanding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is substantially uniformly and evenly constrained over its axial length. If belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> constrain the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at a non-centered axial position on the member, an end of the member opposite that of the non-centered position may be less constrained and may interfere with axial movement of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (and consequently deployment of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> terminates proximally with the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having a plurality of side arms <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and a proximal exit port <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> for the inner lumen <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. First release wire side arm <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> branches from a proximal adapter body portion <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and has an inner lumen <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and proximal end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A proximal extremity <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is anchored to the first release wire proximal handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> which is threaded onto the proximal end <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> of the first release wire side arm <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The proximal extremity <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured as an expanded bushing or other abutment that captures the handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and translates proximal axial movement of the handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> to the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> but allows relative rotational movement between the handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and the proximal end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A similar configuration exists for the proximal end <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. There, a second release wire side arm <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> branches from the proximal adapter body portion <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and has an inner lumen <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> that houses the proximal end <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which is free to slide in an axial orientation within the lumen <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. A proximal extremity <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is configured as an expanded bushing or other abutment that captures the second release wire handle and translates axial proximal movement of the second release wire handle <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, but allows relative rotational movement between the proximal end <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the second release wire handle <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The first release wire handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and second release wire handle <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may optionally be color coded by making each, or at least two, release wire handles a color that is distinctly different from the other. For example, the first release wire handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> could be made green in color with the second release wire handle <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> being red in color. This configuration allows the operator to quickly distinguish between the two release wire handles and facilitates deployment of the belts in the desired order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, instead of color coding of the release wire handles <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the spatial location of the handles can be configured to convey the proper order of deployment of the release wires to the operator of the delivery system. For example, if three release wire handles are required for a particular embodiment, the corresponding three side arms can be positioned along one side of the proximal adapter. In this configuration, the release wire handle that needs to be deployed first can extend from the distal-most side arm. The release wire handle that needs to be deployed second can extend from the middle side arm. The release wire handle that is to be deployed last can extend from the proximal-most side arm. For such a configuration, the operator is merely instructed to start deployment of the release wires at the distal-most release wire handle and work backward in a proximal direction to each adjacent release wire handle until all are deployed. Of course, an opposite or any other suitable configuration could be adopted. The configuration should adopt some type of spatially linear deployment order, either from distal to proximal or proximal to distal, in order to make reliable deployment of the release wires in the proper order easy to understand and repeat for the operator of the delivery system. Other types of release order indicators such as those discussed above could also be used, such as numbering each release wire handle or side arm with a number that indicates the order in which that handle is to be deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The proximal end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> terminates and is secured to an inner lumen <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the proximal end <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> of the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Inner lumen <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> typically has a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> that is aligned with a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> of the proximal section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> elongate shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to allow a guidewire to exit the proximal end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without undergoing bending which could create frictional resistance to axial movement of the guidewire. A proximal port <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> of the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be directly fitted with a hemostasis valve, or it may be fitted with a Luer lock fitting which can accept a hemostasis valve or the like (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be secured to the proximal end <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> by adhesive bonding or other suitable method. A strain relief member <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is secured to the distal end <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> of the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to prevent kinking or distortion of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> at the joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the proximal end <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is secured to a proximal fitting <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> that slides over an outer surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A seal <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> located in proximal fitting <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> provides a fluid seal for the lumen <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> formed between the outer surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the inner lumen <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The fit between the outer surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and the inner surface <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is typically close, but still allows for easy relative axial movement between outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A stop <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is disposed and secured to the outer surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> distal of the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to limit the amount of proximal axial movement of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> relative to the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> When the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is positioned on the proximal shoulder <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the distal nose piece <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> prior to deployment of endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the distance between a proximal extremity <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> of proximal fitting <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and a distal extremity <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> of stop <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to or slightly greater than an axial length of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a constrained state. This configuration allows the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to be proximally retracted to fully expose the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a constrained state prior to deployment of the graft. This distance may be greater, but should not be less than the length of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a constrained state in order to completely free the constrained graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for radial expansion and deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Retraction limiters may alternatively be used to prevent excessive axial movement of the release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in a proximal direction during deployment. Particularly in embodiments of the invention where single release wires are used to constrain and deploy multiple belts such as with first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, retraction limiters may be used to allow enough axial movement of the release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to deploy a first belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, but prevent deployment of a second more proximally located belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> retraction limiter in the form of a filament <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> could be disposed between the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that proximal retraction of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sufficient for deployment of the first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> could be achieved, but not so much as to allow deployment of the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In order to deploy the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the filament <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> would have to be severed or otherwise released. This type of configuration can allow more control over deployment of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and allow deployment in stages which are sequentially controlled to prevent inadvertent deployment of a portion of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in an undesirable location within the patient&apos;s vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In use, the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is advanced into a patient&apos;s arterial system <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> percutaneously as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and positioned so that the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> spans an aneurysm <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is generally desirable to have the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> positioned below the renal arteries <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> in order to prevent significant occlusion of the renal arteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The procedure typically begins with the placement of guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the patient&apos;s target vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> across the target location, e.g., the aneurysm <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. Common percutaneous techniques known in the art may be used for the initial placement of the guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, percutaneous access to the aorta may be had through the femoral or iliac artery, although other access sites may be used. The delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may then be advanced over the guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a desired position within the patient&apos;s vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could be advanced together into the patient&apos;s vasculature <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> with the guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extending distally from the distal port <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the guidewire tube <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In addition, it may be desirable in some cases to advance the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a desired location within the patient without the use of a guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Generally, the position of the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is determined using fluoroscopic imaging or the like. As such, it may be desirable to have one or more radiopaque markers (not shown) secured to the delivery system at various locations. For example, markers may be placed longitudinally coextensive with the respective distal and proximal extremities <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In this way, it can be readily determined whether the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is spanning the aneurysm <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s artery. Imaging markers, such as radiopaque markers, may also be secured to desirable positions on the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> itself. Other types of imaging and marking systems may be used such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging systems and markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Once the distal section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is properly positioned within the patient&apos;s artery <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the operator moves the proximal end <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a proximal direction relative to inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The relative axial movement is carried out by grasping the proximal end <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> or proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and grasping the proximal end <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and moving the respective proximal ends towards each other. This retracts the distal section <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from the constrained endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and frees the graft for outward radial expansion and deployment. However, in this deployment scheme, note that the operator is free to reinsert graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> back into the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> if necessary, as the release bands have not yet released the graft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Once the distal section <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has been retracted, handle <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may then be unscrewed or otherwise freed from the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and retracted in a proximal direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> until the distal end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes from within the end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. When this occurs, the looped ends <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are released and the first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> ceases to radially constrain the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which thereafter self-expands in a radial direction into an inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> If the operator of the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not satisfied with the position, particularly the axial position, of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after deployment of the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it may then be possible to re-position the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by manipulating the proximal end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Movement of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can move the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, even though physical contact between the expanded member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the vessel inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> generates some static frictional forces that resist such movement. It has been found that the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be safely moved within a blood vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> even in the state of partial deployment discussed above, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Once the operator is satisfied with the position of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may then be further proximally retracted so as to deploy the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a manner similar to the deployment of the first distal belt <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The deployment of the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> occurs when the distal end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes from within end loops <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are held in a radially constraining configuration by the first release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Upon release of the second distal belt <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> expands in a radial direction such that it may engage inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The amount of outward radial force exerted by the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the inside surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which may vary between members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, is dependent upon a number of parameters such as the thickness of the material which comprises the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the nominal diameter which the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> would assume in a free unconstrained state with no inward radial force applied, material properties of the members and other factors as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Once the distal members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are deployed, the handle <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be disengaged and axially retracted in a proximal direction from the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> until the distal end <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> passes from within the end loops <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of the proximal belt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Once the proximal belt <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is released, the proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is deployed and expands in an outward radial direction, such that it may engage or be in apposition with the inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Thereafter, the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be inflated with an inflation material (not shown) introduced into the proximal injection port <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> in the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, through the inflation tube <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and into the inflation port <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Inflation material may be injected or introduced into the inflation port <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> until the proximal and distal inflatable cuffs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and inflatable channels <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> have been filled to a sufficient level to meet sealing and other structural requirements necessary for the tubular body to meet clinical performance criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Before or during the deployment process, and preferably prior to or simultaneous with the step of inflating the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it may be beneficial to optionally treat vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in which the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is deployed so to obtain a better seal between the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the vessel inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>, thus improving the clinical result and helping to ensure a long term cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> One approach to this treatment is to administer a vasodilator, or spasmolytic, to the patient prior to deploying graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This has the effect of reducing the tone of the smooth muscle tissue in the patient&apos;s arteries; specifically, the smooth muscle tissue in the wall of vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> into which graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be deployed. Such tone reduction in turn induces the dilation of vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, reducing the patient&apos;s blood pressure. Any number of appropriate vasoactive antagonists, including the direct acting organic nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, nitroprusside), calcium channel blocking agents (e.g., nifedipine), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., captopril), alphaadrenergic blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, prasozin), beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g., esmolol) and other drugs may be used as appropriate. Particularly useful are those vasodilators that can be administered intravenously and that do not have unacceptable contraindications such as aoritic aneurysm dissection, tachycardia, arrhythmia, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The degree of vasodilatation and hypotensive effect will depend in part on the particular vessel in which graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be placed and the amount of smooth muscle cell content. Generally, the smaller the vessel, the larger percentage of smooth muscle cell present and thus the larger effect the vasodilator will have in dilating the vessel. Other factors that will effect the degree of vasodilatation is the health of the patient; in particular, the condition of the vessel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into which graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In practice, once the vasodilator has been administered to the patient, graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be deployed and filled with inflation material so that graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reaches a larger diameter than would otherwise be possible if such a vasodilator was not used. This allows the inflation material to expand the diameter of graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for a given inflation pressure, beyond that which would be achievable if the vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> were in a non-dilated state (and nominal diameter). Alternatively, a larger diameter graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be chosen for deployment. We anticipate that an increased vessel diameter of between two and twenty percent during vasodilatation may be optimal for achieving an improved seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in which graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be placed may optionally be monitored pre- and/or post-dilation but before deployment of graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (via computed tomography, magnetic resonance, intravenous ultrasound, angiography, blood pressure, etc.) so to measure the degree of vasodilatation or simply to confirm that the vasodilator has acted on the vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> prior to deploying graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Once the vasodilator wears off, preferably after between about five and thirty minutes from the time the drug is administered, the vessel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> surrounding graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> returns to its normal diameter. The resultant graft-vessel configuration now contains an enhanced seal between graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and vessel inner surface <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> and provides for reduced luminal intrusion by graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, presenting an improved barrier against leakage and perigraft blood flow compared to that obtainable without the sue of vasodilators or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Such vasodilating techniques may be used with all of the embodiments of the present invention, including the tubular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as well as a bifurcated graft version of the expandable intracorporeal device of the present invention as is discussed in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Once graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fully deployed, a restraining or retention device, such as retention wire <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> that binds the distal end <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to the inflation port <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, is activated. The retention wire <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is activated by pulling the proximal end of the wire in a proximal direction so as to disengage the distal ends <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> from the holes <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. This eliminates the shear pin function of the distal ends <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> and allows the distal end <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> to be disengaged from the inflation port <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>. The release wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may then be fully retracted from the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a proximal direction and the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> retracted in a proximal direction from the deployed endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The unconstrained distal belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> slip through the openings in the expanded members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is retracted and are withdrawn through the inner passageway <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> of the deployed graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The distal nosepiece <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is also withdrawn through the inner passageway <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> of the deployed graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is withdrawn as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Once the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has been proximally retracted, belts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be released. This configuration allows the operator of the delivery system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to first disengage and proximally retract the first release wire handle <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> so as to first release the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> without releasing or otherwise disturbing the constrained state of the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Once the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has been deployed or released, the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be axially moved or repositioned to allow the operator to adjust the position of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for final deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> This is advantageous, particularly in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, because it allows the physician to accurately place graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into position. In many cases, it is desirable for the physician to place the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> such that the distal end of the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the graft is just below the renal arteries <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, to prevent occlusion of the renal arteries by the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. If a self-expanding member, such as self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is radiopaque and the delivery procedure is performed using fluoroscopic imaging, adjustment of the position of the graft after release of self-expanding member is readily achievable. Because self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is immediately adjacent the distal end of the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the ability to visualize and reposition the self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is particularly useful in order to position the distal end of the tubular body portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> just below the renal arteries without occluding the renal arteries, if such positioning is indicated for the patient being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the second release wire handle <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> may be unscrewed or otherwise released from the end cap <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and proximally retracted so as to first release the first distal belt end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and then the proximal belt end loops <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Of course, the position of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may still be adjustable even with both distal self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> deployed, depending on the particular configuration of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>.

Upon inflation of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with an inflation material, a release device, such as retention wire <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> can be retracted or otherwise activated so as to de-couple the inflation tube <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> from the inflation port <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> of the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

A seal <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> is disposed on a proximal end <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> of the central arm <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> for sealing around the guidewire <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and preventing a backflow of blood around the guidewire.

The proximal end <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of the second release wire <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is secured to the second release wire handle <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. The proximal end <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> of the first release wire <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is secured to the first release wire handle <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight>. This configuration prevents the operator from inadvertently deploying or activating the second release wire <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> prior to deployment or activation of the first release wire <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> which could result in an undesirable endovascular graft deployment sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In use, the operator first unscrews or otherwise detaches a threaded portion <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> of the first release wire handle <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> from an outer threaded portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> of a first side arm end cap <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> of a first side arm <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>.

A distal inflatable cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is disposed at the distal end <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the main body portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Proximal inflatable cuffs <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> are disposed on a proximal end <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> respectively. Inflatable channels <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are fluid tight conduits which connect the inflatable cuffs <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The inflatable channels <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and inflatable cuffs <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are inflatable through an inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> that may be disposed at or near the proximal end <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> may also be disposed at or near the proximal end <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, or it may be disposed on other portions of the device as necessary. Generally, the structure and the materials used in the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (both the graft portion and the self-expanding members) can be similar to the structure and materials of the other graft embodiments discussed above. In one particular embodiment, the main body portion and legs of the graft are made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and the self-expanding members are made of nickel titanium, stainless steel or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> A first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is secured to the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. This configuration is similar to that of endovascular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> above. Graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has first and second distal self-expanding members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that may be deployed in any desired sequence. In a particular embodiment having first and second distal self-expanding members, it may be desirable to first deploy the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> prior to deploying the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, deploying the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> first may allow the operator to accurately adjust the axial position of the graft in the body lumen or vessel to within one to several millimeters before deploying the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Using this technique, deployment of the second distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> alone provides sufficient resistance to axial displacement of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for the graft position to be maintained in normal blood flow, but still allows deliberate axial displacement by the operator to achieve a desired axial position. This may be particularly important if tissue-penetrating members are included on the distal-most or first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If such tissue penetrating members are used on the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, axial movement may be difficult or even impossible once this member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is deployed without risking damage to the body lumen or vessel. As such, accurate axial placement of the graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> prior to deployment of the first distal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be critical. </paragraph>

A proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> is disposed at the proximal end <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> and houses the controls that enable the operator to manipulate elements at the distal section <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to release and deploy the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, including inflating the graft channels <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and cuffs <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The elongate shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> has an inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and an outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> disposed about the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> is generally configured to slide in an axial direction over the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. A proximal end <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is secured to or disposed on the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight>. The inner and outer tubular members <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> may be made of polymeric materials, e.g., polyimides, polyester elastomers (HYTREL&reg;), or polyether block amides (PEBAX&reg;), and other thermoplastics and polymers. The outside diameter of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> may range from about 0.1 inch to about 0.4 inch; specifically from about 0.15 inch to about 0.20 inch. The wall thickness of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> may range from about 0.002 inch to about 0.015 inch, specifically from about 0.004 inch to about 0.008 inch. The proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> is generally fabricated from a polymeric material such as polyethylene, acetal resins (DELRIN&reg;), etc., but can also be made from any other suitable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Bifurcated stent graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> disposed within the distal section <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> in a constrained configuration.

As illustrated more fully in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37, a</cross-reference> distal nosepiece <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> may be disposed on a distal end <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and forms a smooth tapered transition from a guidewire tube <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> to the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. This transition helps to facilitate the tracking of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> over a guidewire <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight>. In order to form this smooth transition, the nosepiece <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> may have a length to major diameter ratio ranging from about 3:1 to about 10:1 (the &ldquo;major diameter&rdquo; being defined as the largest diameter of the nosepiece).

A branched release wire is capable of releasing multiple belts in a desired sequence by proper configuration of the lengths of the various branches of the wire. The relative amount of the release wire extending beyond the looped ends of the belt as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</cross-reference> controls the timing of the release of the belts. Alternatively, a single release wire may engage both distal and proximal primary belts <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>. As this single release wire <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is moved proximally, the first distal primary belt <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is first released, followed by the release of the second distal primary belt <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and then release of the proximal primary belt <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the end loops <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> of the belts <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> may vary to suit the particular embodiment of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and device to be delivered. For example, FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>H illustrate a variety of belt and end loop configurations that may be suitable for delivery systems for bifurcated devices. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, belts <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are shown having a twisted configuration that has a tendency to reduce snagging or entanglement of the belts <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> after deployment and release of the belts from a constrained configuration. In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> illustrates an angle &agr; that belts <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> make with respect to line <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, belts <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> would be substantially parallel to each other when in an unconstrained state such that this angle is approximately ninety degrees. It may also be desirable to use belts that have end loops that have different cross sectional areas (or transverse dimensions). For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</cross-reference> shows end loops <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&Prime; constrained by release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. We have found that, depending on the transverse dimension and material of loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; disposed within loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&Prime;, elastic deformation of loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; can hinder the release process when release wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is proximally retracted. Therefore, it may be desirable to make loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; from a material that is substantially smaller in cross sectional area or transverse dimension that that of loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&Prime;. In a particular example, loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; is made from nickel titanium wire having a diameter of about 0.003 to about 0.005 inch, and loop <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&Prime; is made from the same material having a diameter ranging from about 0.005 to about 0.007 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> extends proximally from the proximal end <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is coupled to a distal end <highlight><bold>487</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> by a retention mechanism, such as a retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, the operation of which can be the same or similar to like embodiments of retention wire <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Typically, the retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> extends from the inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> proximally to the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> of delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The distal end <highlight><bold>487</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from the inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> by pulling on a proximal end <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> of retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23, 26</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> may be a small diameter wire made from a material such as a polymer, stainless steel, nickel titanium, other alloy or metal, or composite; in a particular embodiment of the invention, retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> may be a spring formed of a variety of suitable spring materials. Alternatively, the retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> may have a braided or stranded configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> illustrates proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> which is suitable for use with embodiments of the present invention. The proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> houses the proximal termination of the primary release wires <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>, guidewire tube <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> and release wire tube <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>. The proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> has a first side arm <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> with an inner lumen <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> that secures the proximal end <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> of the release wire tube <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> and second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> having an inner lumen in fluid communication with inflation material lumen <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> that houses proximal end <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> of retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>. The proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> has a distal primary release wire handle <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> and a proximal primary release wire handle <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight> that are disposed in a nested configuration on the first side arm <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>. A proximal end <highlight><bold>497</bold></highlight> of the proximal primary release wire <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> is secured to the proximal primary release-wire handle <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. A proximal end <highlight><bold>498</bold></highlight> of the distal primary release wire <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is secured to the distal primary release wire handle <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight>. This configuration prevents the operator from inadvertently deploying or activating the proximal primary release wire <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> prior to deployment or activation of the distal primary release wire <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> which could result in an undesirable graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> deployment sequence. </paragraph>

The distal end <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> is slidingly disposed within the secondary belt support member housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> that is secured to the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The second distal primary belt <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> is secured to the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> (which in this embodiment is the guidewire tube <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>) and extends radially therefrom through an optional second distal primary standoff tube <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In general, the various features and components (including, e.g., details of various embodiments of the release wires, the self-expanding members, belts, inflation port and tube, guidewire tube, standoff tubes, proximal adapter and its associated components, the materials and dimensions for each of the various components, etc.) as discussed herein with respect to those embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be used in the bifurcated embodiments of the present invention as discussed herein and as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In use, the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for delivery of a bifurcated intracorporeal device, specifically, a bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, can be operated in a similar fashion to the delivery systems discussed above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> illustrates generally the anatomy of a patient&apos;s heart <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, aorta <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and iliac arteries <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. The aorta extends from the heart <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and descends into the abdomen of the patient&apos;s body. An aneurysm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is disposed in the aorta <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> just below the renal arteries <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>. The aorta <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> branches into the right and left iliac arteries <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> below the aneurysm, which then become the femoral arteries <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> One delivery procedure of the present invention begins with delivery of a first guidewire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> into an access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in a femoral artery, the right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> for the procedure depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, and advanced distally through the iliac artery <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> and into the patient&apos;s aorta <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. Access into the femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is generally accomplished with a standard sheath and trocar kit, although sheathless access may also be employed. It should be noted that although the procedure described herein and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is initiated in the right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, the same procedure could be carried out beginning in the left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> with the orientation reversed. A vasodilator may optionally be administered to the patient at this point as previously discussed. If desired, a vasodilator may also be administered later in the procedure, but preferably prior to or simultaneous with the step of introducing inflation material into the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> With the first guidewire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> positioned across the aneurysm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, a second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is then introduced into the ipsilateral or right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and guided into the iliacs <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> and then back down into the contralateral or left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. A distal end <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> of the second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> may then be captured with a snare <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> or similar device inserted through an access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> in the left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>. The distal end <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> of the second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> may then be pulled out of the left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> through the same left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, providing a continuous length of wire passing through each iliac artery <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> via the left and right femoral artery access holes <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Once the second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> exits the access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> in the left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>, a tubular catheter <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> may be advanced over the second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> through the left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> so as to extend out of the body from the access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. This provides a continuous conduit between the right and left iliac arteries <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. With a distal end <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> of the tubular catheter <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> extending from the access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, a distal end <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> of the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> may then be affixed to a proximal end <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> of the second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. For purposes of simplicity, the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> is shown in, e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in schematic form as a single strand. However, it is understood that the term &ldquo;secondary release cable&rdquo; encompasses a single or multiple-component feature of the present invention that may be used to assist in the deployment of the graft. For instance, in the embodiment depicted herein, the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> represents the combination of the release strand <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and release strand tube <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> discussed above in conjunction with, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. Other variations of this combination are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The second guidewire <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is then pulled out of the tubular catheter <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> from the left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, in the direction indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, so that the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> then extends through the tubular catheter <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> from the right iliac artery to the left iliac artery. The tubular catheter <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> may then be withdrawn, leaving the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> extending through the left and right iliac arteries <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> from the access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> to the access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> in the left femoral artery <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>. The first guidewire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> remains in position across the aneurysm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is then advanced into the patient&apos;s right femoral artery <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> through the access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> over the first guidewire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. It may be desirable to apply tension to the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> as the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is advanced to the vicinity of the aneurysm <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> so as to remove slack in the cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> and prevent tangling of the cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> or the like. Tension on the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> may also help to prevent twisting of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> during insertion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A-B show an optional marker band that may disposed adjacent nosepiece <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> or generally in the vicinity of the distal end of the delivery system <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>. Such a marker band <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> may also be integral with the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>; for example, it may be incorporated as part of the distal nosepiece <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. A useful marker <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> can be one that does not add to the profile of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</cross-reference> (i.e., one that does not give the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> a higher diameter). The embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A-B are useful in the present embodiment, although they may be used in the embodiments discussed above. Such a marker may be used to aid the operator in introducing the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> without twisting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> For example, the marker embodiment <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</cross-reference> comprises a marker body <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> in the form of a simple discontinuous ring made of an appropriate radiopaque material (e.g., platinum, gold, etc.) visible under fluoroscopy, etc. The cross section of the ring may be asymmetric so that under fluoroscopy the cross section may be seen in the vicinity of the discontinuity <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight>. The operator will be able to tell if the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is twisted by how the ring <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> is presented under fluoroscopy. Alternatively, ring <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> may be continuous but have a notch or similar cutout to serve the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The embodiment <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference> is an example of such a marker. Here, both a notch <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> and two circular holes <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> have been cut out of the marker body <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> for easier determination of its orientation when disposed on the notch or other part of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. For instance, in an orientation where the two circular holes <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> are aligned with respect to the fluoroscope field of view, the user will see a single circular hole to the left of a triangular or vee-shape cutout <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> on the side of the marker <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. As the angular orientation of the device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (and thus the marker <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>) about the longitudinal axis changes, the appearance of the two circular holes <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> and side notch <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> will change. If the device is twisted clockwise ninety degrees from this orientation along its central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>A, for instance, the circles <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> will largely disappear from view and the side notch <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> will generally appear in the front of the field of view as a symmetric diamond. Comparing these views will allow the user to know that the entire delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has twisted about ninety degrees. Keeping the same orientation, then, will be made easier with such a marker <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> For each of the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A-B, variations in the shape, number, orientation, pattern and location of the notch <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight>, holes <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> or other discontinuity, as well as various marker body dimensions cross sectional shape, etc., may be realized, as long as the marker <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> is configured so that the angular orientation of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may readily be determined by the user under fluoroscopy or similar imaging technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is positioned in a location suitable for initiating the deployment process, such as one in which the distal end <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed beyond, or distal to the position in which the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> will be placed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. This position allows the proximal end <highlight><bold>483</bold></highlight> of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> to be laterally displaced without mechanical interference from the patient&apos;s vasculature. Such clearance for lateral displacement is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Once the distal section <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> of the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> and the endovascular graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are positioned, the deployment process is initiated. First, the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> is proximally retracted by pulling on the proximal end <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> relative to the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> should be maintained in a stable axial position, as the position of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> determines the position of the constrained bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> prior to deployment. Upon retraction of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>, the constrained bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is exposed and additional slack is created in the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> as shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a variety of different components may be substituted for the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> in some of the embodiments of the invention. For instance, a shroud, corset, mummy-wrap, or other cover may be released or actuated to expose the constrained graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> after the delivering system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is introduced into the vasculature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> The slack in the secondary release cable <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> is taken up by applying tension to both lengths <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> as shown by the arrows <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. In alternative embodiments, release strand is not continuous such that lengths <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> each has a free end, each of which may be manipulated by the operator. As tension continues to be applied to both lengths <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>, the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> begins to slide within the secondary belt support member housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> in a proximal direction as shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. The secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> continues to slide proximally until all the slack is removed from an axially compressed or folded portion <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> and the primary and secondary belt support members <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> are oriented relative to the secondary belt support member housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. Rotational movement of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> relative to the secondary belt support member housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> is prevented by the non-circular or asymmetric cross section of the member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B. This prevents the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> from twisting or becoming entangled with other components of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> or delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> during deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Axial compression of all or a portion of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> while the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is in a constrained state within the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> prior to deployment allows the axial position of the two proximal self-expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to be axially offset from each other. Alternatively, graft legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> having different lengths may be used to prevent overlap of the self-expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> within the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The cross sectional profile or area of the overlap self-expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is generally greater than that of the adjacent polymer material portion of the legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, so eliminating the overlap can be desirable. The self<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are typically made of a metal or metallic alloy and maintain a cylindrical configuration, even when in a constrained state. The polymer material of the legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> or main body portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, by contrast, is relatively soft and malleable and can conform to the shape of whatever lumen in which it may be constrained. Placing both proximal self-expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> adjacent each other in a compressed state at a single axial position within the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> would require a configuration in which two objects having an approximately circular cross section are being placed within another circular lumen. Such a configuration generates a significant amount of wasted or unused cross sectional area within that axial position of the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and would likely result in less flexibility and greater cross section than a delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in which the proximal self-expanding members <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are axially offset. </paragraph>

The direction of such tension is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> by the arrows <highlight><bold>591</bold></highlight>. Upon the application of this proximal tension, the actuator hub <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> is moved proximally, as is the secondary release wire <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> that is secured to the actuator hub <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. The proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> deploys when the distal end <highlight><bold>587</bold></highlight> of the secondary release wire <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> passes through the end loops <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight> of the secondary belt <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> so as to release the radial constraint on the proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> imposed by the secondary belt <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>.

Once the proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is expanded, the operator may then apply tension to both lengths <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> to withdraw the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>) and remove it from the patient&apos;s vasculature through the left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Generally, all other features of the delivery system <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> can be the same as the delivery systems discussed above. It should be noted, however, that the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> does not allow the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> to slide in an axial direction relative to the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. As such, it may be desirable to use this embodiment to deliver and deploy a graft having legs that are not substantially equal in length. Otherwise, if proximal self-expanding members are to be axially offset, the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> would have to be detached from the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> prior to deploying and releasing the secondary belt (not shown). </paragraph>

Linear and rotational motion of secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> relative to primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is prevented until wire <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> is withdrawn, freeing member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> to be removed from housing <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>. Typically the aperatures are disposed at an angle (such as about <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> degrees) relative to the surface of the members through which they reside so to minimize the angles through which retention wire <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> turn as is passes through the apertures.

All other features of the delivery system <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> can be the same as the delivery systems discussed above. In use, after all self-expanding members have been deployed, the delivery system <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> is advanced distally into the patient&apos;s vasculature, as shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>, in order to achieve a gap between a proximal end <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and the patient&apos;s vasculature as shown by the arrows <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>.

Once the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> has been fully retracted in a lateral direction so as to be substantially parallel to the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the delivery system <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> can then be retracted from the patient&apos;s vasculature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> If not previously filled, the bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may thereafter be inflated with an inflation material described with respect to the tubular graft embodiment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> For all the embodiments described, both tubular and bifurcated, inflation is generally accomplished by inserting or injecting, via one or more device such as a syringe or other suitable mechanism, the inflation material under a pressure- or volume-control environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> For instance, in one embodiment of a pressure-control technique, a volume of inflation material is first injected into the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (which at this point may include the graft, but may also include the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>). The particular desired volume of inflation material will depend on several factors, including, e.g., the composition and nature of the inflation and polymer graft material, the size of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to be deployed, the vessel or lumen diameter into which the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is deployed, the configuration of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (tubular, bifurcated, etc.), the features of the graft main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and (if present) legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, and the conditions during the procedure (such as temperature). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the operator may affix a pressure control device, such as an inflation syringe, to the injection port <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> of the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube and apply a pressure to the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and a graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for a period of time. This serves to ensure that the fill material previously introduced enters the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and fills it to the desired pressure level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> We have found that a useful pressure-control approach involves a series of such constant pressure applications, each for a period of time. For instance, the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may first be pressurized at a level from about 5 psi to about 12 psi or higher, preferably about 9 psi, for between about 5 seconds and 5 minutes, preferably about 3 minutes or more. Optional monitoring of the fluid and the device during the fill procedure may be used to help ensure a proper fill. Such monitoring may be accomplished under fluoroscopy or other technique, for instance, if the fill material is radiopaque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the fill protocol may be completed, or the pressure may be increased to between about 10 psi and about 15 psi or higher, preferably about 12 psi, for an additional period of time ranging from between about 5 seconds and 5 minutes or more, preferably about 1 minute. If the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> so requires, the pressure may be increased one or more additional times in the same fashion to effect the proper fill. For instance, subsequent pressure may be applied between about 12 and 20 psi or more, preferably about 16 psi to 18 psi, for the time required to satisfy the operator that the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is sufficiently filled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The details of particular pressure-time profiles, as well as whether a single pressure-time application or a series of such applications is used to fill embodiments of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> will depend on the factors described above with respect to the volume of fill material used; the properties and composition of the fill material tend to be of significance in optimizing the fill protocol. For example, a stepped series of pressure-time profiles as described above is useful when the fill material comprises a hardenable or curable material whose physical properties may be time-dependent and which change after being introduced into the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and its delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a volume-control method may be utilized to fill embodiments of the grafts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, including both tubular and bifurcated. Here, a volume of fill material is again introduced into the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> as described above. In this method, however, the volume of fill material used is precisely enough material to fill the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and any other component in the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> through which the fill fluid may travel on its way to the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The operator introduces the predetermined quantity of fill material, preferably with a syringe or similar mechanism, into the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> and graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. A precise amount of fill material may be measured into a syringe, for example, so that when the syringe is emptied into the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the exact desired amount of fill material has reached the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. After a period of time (which period will depend on the factors previously discussed), the syringe or equivalent may be removed from the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> or injection port <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> of proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> and the procedure completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> A pressurized cartridge of gas or other fluid may be used in lieu of a syringe to introduce the fill material into the delivery system and graft under this volume-control regime so to provide a consistent and reliable force for moving the fill material into the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. This minimizes the chance that variations in the force and rate of fill material introduction via a syringe-based technique affect the fill protocol and possibly the clinical efficacy of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> For each of the pressure- and volume-control configurations, an optional pressure relief system may be included so to bleed any air or other fluid existing in the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> prior to the introduction of the fill material (such as the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> or graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) so to avoid introducing such fluid into the patient. Such an optional system may, for example, comprise a pressure relief valve at the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>/inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> interface and a pressure relief tube disposed through the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (e.g., adjacent the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>) terminating at the proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> and vented to the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> When graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is deployed in certain anatomies, such as those where the iliac arteries are tortuous or otherwise angled, the lumen of one or more of graft inflatable cuffs <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and channels <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of may become pinched or restricted in those portions of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> experiencing a moderate or high-angle bend due to the tortuosity of the vessel into which that portion of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is deployed. This reduction or even elimination of cuff/channel patency can hinder and sometimes prevent adequate cuff and channel inflation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In addition, graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and/or legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may, upon initial retraction of outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and deployment into the vasculature, resist the &ldquo;windsock&rdquo; effect that tends to open up the graft to its nominal diameter. Then in turn may lead to inadequate cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> patency prior to their injection with inflation material. The windsock effect has a higher likelihood of being hindered when graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is deployed in relatively tortuous or angled anatomies; however, it may also be made more difficult when graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (and even tubular graft embodiments such as graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is deployed in relatively non-tortuous anatomies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> To address this issue, we have found it useful to incorporate an optional ripcord or monofilament into the inflatable channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. Pre-loading such a ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> into all or a portion of the channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> that runs along graft ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and main body portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> promotes effective inflation of the graft cuffs and channels as will be described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> extends in one embodiment from distal cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> through channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, proximal cuff <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, and continues through inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> and through second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> of proximal adapter <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference>. A flexible fill catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> may be affixed to end of second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> at injection port <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> extends through injection port <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> and catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> where it is affixed to a removable Luer-type fitting or cap <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> at catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> terminus <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> (which can serve as an injection port). Alternatively, in lieu of catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, fitting <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> may be removably connected directly to injection port <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. Fill catheter may compromise an optional pressure relief valve (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In use, after graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> has been deployed into the vasculature but prior to injecting the inflation material through second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight>, the operator removes fitting <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> from catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and pulls ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> proximally out of the ipsilateral graft channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> and out through the end of catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. This leaves behind an unobstructed lumen in channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> through which inflation material may pass as it is injected into the device, despite any folds, wrinkles, or angles that may exist in graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> due to vessel tortuosity or angulation, lack of windsocking, or other phenomena. Inflation material may then be injected into channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and cuffs <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> through second side arm <highlight><bold>499</bold></highlight> as described elsewhere herein. Inflation material passes through the lumen in channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> left behind after ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is removed and reaches distal cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. As cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> fills, a hemostatic seal is created at distal end of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> which promotes the desired windsocking of the graft. This in turn promotes the effective filling of the rest of the cuffs <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and channels <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and any other lumens in which the inflation material may be directed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Suitable materials for ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> include polymeric monofilaments, such as PTFE, Polypropylene, nVion, etc. Metallic filaments such as stainless steel, nickel titanium, etc. may be used as well. The diameter of ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> should be small compared to the diameter of channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> lumen to minimize impact on delivery system profile, yet large enough to permit reasonable flow of inflation material into channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> lumen following its removal. We have found that a ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> diameter of between about 0.005 inch and 0.025 inch to be appropriate; in particular, a ripcord diameter of about 0.015 inch is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, or in conjunction with ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, one or more permanent monofilament lumen patency members or beads may be incorporated into one or more of the cuffs and channels to facilitate the inflation process. We have found it useful to incorporate a single bead into graft contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> along with ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in the graft ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference> is a simplified cross sectional schematic view of contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> inflatable channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> having a bead <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> disposed in a lumen <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, taken along line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Typically bead <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> extends from proximal cuff <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to distal cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, although it may be disposed in only a portion of channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> or in other cuffs or channels of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference> as bent or angled out of the plane of the page to simulate contralateral limb <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> placement in a highly angled iliac artery. Under such bending forces, the walls <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> tend to close on lumen patency member <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, reducing the size of lumen <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to be confined to the areas indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference>. As can be seen, bead <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> prevents the lumen <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> from collapsing to the point where lumen <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> loses patency sufficient for satisfactory passage of inflation material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Bead <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may have the same dimensions and comprise materials the same as or similar to ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. In particular, we have found a PTFE bead having a diameter of about 0.020 inch to be useful in the channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> We have found that incorporating a ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and/or one or more lumen patency members <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in the system of the present invention enhances the likelihood that graft cuffs and channels will reliably and sufficiently fill with inflation material. In one extreme experiment designed to test the feasibility of this concept, a bifurcated graft contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> having a bead <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> disposed in the contralateral limb channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> was tied into a knot at the leg proximal end <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>. Inflation material was injected through ipsilateral leg inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> under a pressure-control protocol. All cuffs and channels of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, including contralateral leg channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and proximal cuff <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, filled completely without having to increase the fill pressure beyond normal levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Although the benefits of ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and one or more beads <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (together or in combination) may be most readily gained when graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is deployed in tortuous or highly angled anatomies, these components are also useful in grafts deployed in relatively straight and non-tortuous anatomies. They may also be used in tubular stent-grafts of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a bifurcated graft delivery system <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> and method is illustrated. This embodiment is tailored to provide for a controlled withdrawal of a secondary release cable from a lumen of an inner tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> so to help eliminate the possibility that the release cable <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> becomes entangled or otherwise twisted during deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> is a well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> is disposed in the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. Well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> contains a release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> that is looped at its proximal end <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> outside the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> through an aperture <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> in the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> and that is affixed or attached at its distal end <highlight><bold>637</bold></highlight> to a second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>. The second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> is shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> as disposed in its own optional lumen <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight> within the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Within the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight>, the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> is arranged to form a &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; in which it changes direction to double back on itself at juncture <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. At juncture <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight>, a friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> is looped around all or a portion of the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight>. This friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> is fixed to the bottom of the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> on one end <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>A and is free on another end <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>B. The friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> is preferably a polymeric monofilament such as polyimide, etc., but may be metallic and may be braided as necessary to achieve the desired friction characteristic needed to interact with release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight>. Friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> has a length sufficient to interact with the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> during the deployment process until the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> has been completely removed from the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> as will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In use, the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> works as follows. Once the left and right femoral access holes <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, discussed above, have been created, the delivery system <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> is introduced into and through the patient&apos;s vasculature. A snare catheter <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> is introduced into the left femoral artery access hole, such as the left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> discussed above. The operator then captures the tip <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> of the second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> with the snare <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>, the second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> is shown as pre-attached to the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> at the distal end <highlight><bold>637</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> A ball capture tip <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>A or similar member may optionally be disposed on the tip <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> of second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> to facilitate its capture by snare catheter <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> and prevent possible injury to the vessel intima. In addition, tip <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>A may be made radiopaque so that it may be readily located by the operator during the procedure. When in the form of a ball, tip <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>A may have a diameter ranging from between about 0.020 inch to about 0.120 inch, specifically, between about 0.040 inch to about 0.060 inch. Although not shown in the figures, second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> may also have one or more additional sections branching therefrom, each having a tip or member similar to tip <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, including tip <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>A, so to provide the operator with one or more alternative sites for capture with snare <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> in case tip <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight>A is inaccessible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> An angled extension <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight>A may optionally be provided on one or both of the top of optional lumen <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight> and/or the top of well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight>. Angled extension <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight>A may be made of any suitable polymeric or metallic material such as stainless steel. As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, extension <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight>A disposed on the top of lumen <highlight><bold>639</bold></highlight> is generally biased towards the artery in which snare <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> is disposed at an angle of between about 20 degrees and about 120 degrees, specifically, between about 40 degrees and about 95 degrees, so to guide the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> in the proper direction and thus facilitate ease of capture by snare <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> As the second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> from the left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> feeds out of the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> in an orderly and linear fashion in a direction from the release strand distal end <highlight><bold>637</bold></highlight> to its proximal end <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight>. This is made possible by the forces created at the &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; or juncture <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> by the physical interface with the friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. The friction force (which can be tailored by the proper combination of release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> and friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> diameters and their materials and by properly dimensioning of the well <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight>, for example) provides enough resistance to counter the force applied by the operator so that the &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; or juncture <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> moves in an orderly fashion in a direction from the well bottom <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> to the distal end <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> of the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> until it exits out of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. At this point, any remaining friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> at the juncture <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> is superfluous as it has served its purpose of facilitating an orderly withdrawal of the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight>. The operator continues to pull on the second guidewire <highlight><bold>638</bold></highlight> as previously described so that the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> extends through the left femoral artery access port <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>. We have found the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> to be useful in achieving an orderly and tangle-free deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, any number of other arrangements in which the release strand <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> may be fed out of the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> in an orderly manner is within the scope of the present invention. For instance, the well <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is, for instance, an extruded polymeric part having a unique cross-sectional configuration that eliminates the need for the friction line <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. Here, a narrowing constraint or gap <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> runs the length of the well interior <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>, forming a physical barrier between first and second opposing portions <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight>, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The constraint or gap <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> is sized to allow the passage therethrough of the release strand juncture or &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>. As the operator pulls the release strand <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> out of the well <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>, the constraint or gap <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> prevents the opposing portions <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> from crossing into the other side of the well <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. Said another way, the constraint or gap <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> keeps the juncture or &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> within its vicinity to facilitate an orderly withdrawal of the release strand <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> from the well <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the release strand <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> can have a diameter of between about 0.004 and 0.010 inch; specifically between about 0.006 and 0.007 inch. The gap or constraint <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> should be between about 0.003 and about 0.009 inch; preferably between about 0.005 and about 0.006 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Yet another variation of this embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>, includes a post <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> disposed in a well <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> around which the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> is wound such that as the operator pulls the distal portion <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> of the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> out of the distal end <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> of the well <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>, the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> unwinds in an orderly fashion from the post <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight>. The post <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> may be optionally configured to spin on its longitudinal axis, similar to that of a fishing reel spinner, to facilitate the exit of the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Other variations, such as a block and tackle arrangement (not shown), are envisioned in which the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> is looped through a grommet or similar feature. The grommet provides the necessary friction to prevent the entire release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> from pulling out of the well <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> in one mass as soon as the operator applies a force on a distal end thereof. Any arrangement in which a frictional or similar force is utilized to allow for the orderly dispensation of the release strand <highlight><bold>663</bold></highlight> from the shaft or post <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> is within the scope of the embodiment contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference> depicts an optional hinged design for the belt support members that is particularly useful for deploying the bifurcated stent-graft in tortuous and/or angled anatomies, although it may be used in all anatomies. Bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is depicted in phantom for reference. A hinge body <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is affixed to guide wire tube <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> or primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> disposed on one side of primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is configured to receive hinge attachment member <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, which in this embodiment is a wire that is looped through aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and fixed to secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. The hinge created at aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> allows support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> to swing away from and towards primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>, aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is disposed on the side of primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> opposite that on which secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> resides to facilitate extraction of the belt support members from the graft and the patient&apos;s body after graft deployment. However, aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may also be disposed on the same side of primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> as that of secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> or in any suitable orientation around member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is affixed to release strand attachment member <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> at secondary belt support member proximal end <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and is preferably a stainless steel wire having a diameter of between about 0.004 inch and 0.010 inch, although other materials and diameters may be used. Secondary belt <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> is shown disposed on support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> along with optional silicone tubing <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Chiefly in tortuous or angled anatomies, but also in straighter vessels, it is useful to allow for a degree of slack in the contralateral limb <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to be loaded into the elongate shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>. Such slack helps the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> negotiate various bends in the iliac and/or femoral arteries. The total amount of slack &Dgr;I ideally necessary for a graft limb such as limb <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to negotiate an angle d&Dgr;&THgr; is represented by the equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;I&equals;d&Dgr;&THgr;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;&Dgr;&THgr;&rdquo; is the cumulative angle change (the sum of the absolute value of the angles through which the limb must negotiate) along its length, measured in radians, and where &ldquo;d&rdquo; is the diameter of the graft limb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The hinge design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference> allows the necessary amount of slack &Dgr;I to be maintained in the contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> both during the step of loading graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in shaft <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> and during graft deployment and placement. Note that in an embodiment of the present invention, a predetermined amount of slack may also be built into the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as it is assembled for delivery. By building a predetermined amount of slack in each of the legs of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the most prevalent patient anatomies may, for instance, be targeted so that the average graft delivery procedure will require the smallest amount of leg adjustment or manipulation by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> After graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> has been deployed, the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference> is next withdrawn from the graft and the patient&apos;s vasculature in the direction of arrows <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference> over guide wire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. During this withdrawal, secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> rotates about aperture <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and pivots towards primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. An optional buttress may be employed as described later to facilitate the withdrawal process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Both primary and secondary belt support members are ideally radiopaque to facilitate withdrawal from the vasculature. Secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> and hinge attachment member <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> should be flexible enough to turn the corner around graft bifurcation <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> with little or no permanent deformation as the operator withdraws the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrows <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Withdrawal of member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> causes secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> to first retreat from contralateral limb <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> until the proximal end <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> of secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> clears the graft walls in the vicinity of bifurcation <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, allowing the hinge to further act to align secondary belt support member in a generally parallel relationship with primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> as both are then withdrawn through the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and eventually out of the patient&apos;s body through right femoral access hole <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>. Release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> follows secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> out of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>A-B depict a variation of this hinge design that limits rotation of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> to a single plane. Here, hinge body <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is fixedly disposed on a distal portion <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> of primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and comprises an offset flanged pin <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> or like element. Pin <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> is disposed in an aperture <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> that runs through the distal end <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> and hinge body <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> is rotatably secured to pin <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> by optional flange <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> and is free to rotate about pin <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> to facilitate withdrawal of the delivery apparatus from the patient. The optional offset feature of pin <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> assists in the extraction of the belt support members from the graft and the Patient&apos;s body after graft deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference> shows a close up partial cross-sectional view of the proximal end <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> of graft contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> disposed on the FIGS. <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> (or alternatively <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>A-B) secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. Release strand tube <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, part of secondary release cable <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>, houses release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, a secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> (which holds secondary belt <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> around contralateral proximal self expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>), and a shield line <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> that is fixedly attached at its distal end <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> to optional contralateral self-expanding member shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Optional expanding member shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> comprises PET or similar polymeric material. Shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> acts as a shroud to cover proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, protecting ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> from being damaged by self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> during delivery system assembly and graft deployment. Further, shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> prevents direct contact between contralateral self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and ipsilateral self-expanding member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, keeping the various self expanding member components from snaring one another or otherwise getting entangled. The exact position of graft contralateral proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> relative to graft ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and self-expanding member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> will depend on several factors, one of which is the degree of slack built into the graft legs <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> on members <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> may be removed prior to retraction of secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> by retracting shield line <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight>, typically after release strand tube <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> has been removed, and ultimately out of the patient&apos;s body through left femoral artery access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>. As shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> is retracted, release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> pass through wire apertures <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, respectively. Alternatively, a single wire aperture may be disposed on shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> through which both release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> pass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> A variation in the deployment sequence that may be used with any of the sequences and equipment described above may be appropriate in certain clinical settings when the patient&apos;s vasculature exhibits a degree of tortuosity and/or angulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Related to the cuff and channel lumen patency matter discussed above are at least two additional considerations when deploying a device such as bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in tortuous or angled anatomies. First, it can be more challenging to maintain the patency of either or both the blood flow passageways formed by the walls of graft contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and/or ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Such challenges may also be presented in the blood flow passageways defined by graft main body <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and tubular graft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> embodiments. This may in turn negatively affect the patency of the cuff and channel lumens such that the cuffs and channels cannot adequately be filled with inflation material. Second, the outer tubular member <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> can be more difficult to retract proximally relative to inner tubular member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> when the delivery system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed in such angled and/or tortuous anatomies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The delivery method discussed with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> teaches that the steps of deploying the distal and proximal self-expanding members are accomplished prior to the step of inflating the graft cuffs and channels. A variation in this deployment sequence that is useful for tortuous or angled patient anatomies is discussed below in conjunction with the delivery system components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A, 31B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, although any of the delivery systems or their components described herein may employ this sequence variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> During the delivery procedure, after the first and second distal self expanding members <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> have been released, the operator removes release strand tube <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> from the body through the left femoral access hole <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>. This exposes release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight>, and shield line <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Next, the shield line <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is pulled in a proximal direction <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight> by the operator to remove shield <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> from the contralateral leg proximal end <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, exposing self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. A buttress, which can be a tubular member such as a catheter or the like, is threaded on the remaining secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> and release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and advanced distally until it physically abuts the proximal end <highlight><bold>483</bold></highlight> of the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. This provides a relatively stiff column that the operator may use to move the graft contralateral leq <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> in a distal direction as well as react the force necessary to deploy self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> by retracting release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The operator next detaches Luer-type fitting or cap <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> from flexible fill catheter <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and removes ripcord <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> from channel <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. Graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> cuffs and channels may then be filled with inflation material as previously described. When the inflation material is radiopaque or otherwise observable in vivo, the operator may interrogate the shape of the graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the various cuffs and channels under fluoroscopy or other suitable imaging technique to determine qraft limb patency, the sufficiency of graft cuff and channel inflation, and whether any folds or other irregularities in the graft exist so that they may be corrected. When observed under fluoroscopy, the operator may adjust the C-arm of the fluoroscope to interrogate graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> from a number of angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> If necessary, and after cuff and channel inflation but before proximal self-expanding member deployment, the operator may manipulate both the buttress catheter and/or release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to push or pull, respectively, the qraft contralateral leq into. the proper position. By making fine adjustments in either direction, the operator may remove or add slack in the graft contralateral leg <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and ensure optimal qraft placement and patency. To minimize operator confusion, the release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and stent release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> may be different lenqths, color coded, flagged or otherwise labeled, etc. We have found that making the stent release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> shorter than release strand <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> helps in maintaining optimal operator orientation with respect to the various components of the qraft delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> When the operator is satisfied with the position, patency, and appearance of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, contralateral self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may be deployed by applying tension in the proximal direction <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight> on secondary release wire <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> so that secondary belt <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> releases proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> in the manner previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the operator next may adjust the position of the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of graft <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> by adjusting the position of primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and then release proximal self-expanding member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of the ipsilateral leg <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> To withdraw the delivery apparatus, guide wire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is partially withdrawn in the proximal direction through nosepiece <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> into guide wire tube <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> to a point proximal of cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. This prevents the guide wire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> from possible interference with proper inflation of cuff <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. Next, the distal end <highlight><bold>487</bold></highlight> of the inflation tube <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> may be disengaged from the inflation port <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> by pulling on a proximal end <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> of retention wire <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> as previously discussed. Using the buttress to push on belt support member proximal portion <highlight><bold>483</bold></highlight> if necessary, the operator may then proximally withdraw the primary belt support member <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> over guide wire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> with the secondary belt support member <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> following. Finally, guide wire <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is removed through left and right femoral access holes <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, which may then be repaired using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> It is clear to those of skill in the art that although particular techniques and steps are described herein that we have found to be useful, variations in the order and techniques in which the various deployment steps described herein are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> While particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be so limited. </paragraph>
