<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a lens sheet adaptable to a transparent screen for a single light source projection television or the like using a liquid crystal, a digital light processor (hereinafter abbreviated to &ldquo;a DLP&rdquo;) or the like, and a producing method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a single light source projector of a matrix display using a liquid crystal, a DLP or the like has been found to be more excellent from the viewpoint of brightness, compactness or the like in comparison with a conventional CRT projector, and thus, it has been brought to the commercial stage. Since the matrix display is performed per pixel in the single light source projector, there may arise a problem of a moir&eacute; which is generated between a lens pitch of a lenticular lens included in a transparent screen for displaying an image and a pixel pitch of an image to be projected. In order to avoid the moir&eacute;, the pitch of the lenticular lens need be as fine as about 0.2 mm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been known that a light absorbing layer called as a black stripe or the like is effective as measure for reducing an adverse influence of outside light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views showing lenticular lens sheets in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> is a view showing a conventional lenticular lens sheet in which a pitch is not made to be fine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the case where a light absorbing layer BS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed in a conventional lenticular lens sheet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> formed into a substantially elliptical shape in cross section, the light absorbing layer BS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> need be formed at a non-light collecting portion at which no retraction light L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> is a view showing the conventional lenticular lens sheet in which a pitch is made to be fine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the case where the pitch of the conventional lenticular lens sheet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is made to be fine (a pitch P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is changed to a pitch P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), a focal distance becomes shorter since a unit lens is reduced in size. Consequently, the distance from the unit lens to the non-light collecting portion also becomes shorter, and therefore, a lenticular lens sheet <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also need be reduced in thickness (a thickness t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is changed to a thickness t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, when the lenticular lens sheet becomes thinner according to the fineness of the pitch, as described above, there has arisen a problem of the difficulty of molding with high accuracy in producing by extrusion with high productivity, like in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is necessary to align the lenticular lens with the light absorbing layer with high accuracy, and thus, there have arisen problems of an increase in cost of a producing apparatus and deterioration of productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In view of this, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 10-111537 discloses a screen including an outside light absorbing layer in a lens unit of an elliptical lenticular lens as a lenticular lens of a fine pitch without any alignment. In this screen, it is unnecessary to dispose a light absorbing layer in a non-light collecting portion, thereby dispensing with alignment, with an advantage of fabrication of a lenticular lens of a fine pitch with relative ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, since a light absorbing layer is disposed at a portion at which light transmits, there has arisen a problem of deterioration of light utilizing efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2-22932 discloses a lenticular lens having an uneven shape in which the cross-sectional shape of a unit lens is not a substantially elliptical shape which is effective in collecting light and composed of a portion at which an incident light transmits, a portion at which the incident light is fully reflected and a light absorbing layer formed on the portion at which the incident light is fully reflected, and a producing method therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this screen producing method, a light absorbing layer is formed outside of a concave reflecting layer by a spraying, coating or squeezing method by the use of black ink. However, the use of these methods causes an uneven outward appearance such as coating thickness unevenness or drying unevenness, thereby arising a problem of the difficulty of the fabrication of a screen without any deficient outward appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the methods for forming the reflecting layer and the light absorbing layer are independent of each other, there has arisen a problem of increases in cost of producing apparatuses and cost of fabrication. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The UV adhesive layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a layer adapted to stick the lens sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the front plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to each other, and is made of an ultraviolet curable type adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The front plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a substantially transparent plate made of an acrylic resin, an acrylic styrene copolymer resin, a styrene resin, a polycarbonate resin or the like, and is formed in a thickness of about 2 mm to 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Since the lens sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thinly formed, as described above, over a wide area (used in a size of 70 inch in the present embodiment), it only by itself cannot be held in its own state, which is caused by flexure. Therefore, the front plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is closely stuck to the lens sheet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while functioning as a reinforcing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, explanation will be made on a method for producing the lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a chart illustrating the flow of the method for producing the lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The method for producing the lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises: (A) a lens layer shaping process; (B) a peeling layer forming process; (C) a reflecting layer forming process; (D) a BS layer forming process (a light attenuating layer forming process); (E) a light emitting portion exposing process; and (F) a front plate laminating process. These processes are performed in sequence, thereby producing the lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view illustrating both of the lens layer shaping process and the peeling layer forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (A: Lens Layer Shaping Process) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> First of all, the lens layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate film layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this lens layer shaping process, a press-fitting process, a hardening process and a die removing process, as described below, are performed in sequence, thereby forming the lens layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the press-fitting process, an ionizing radiation curable resin is applied between a shaping die and a substrate film, and then, the substrate film is press-fitted to the shaping die via the ionizing radiation curable resin by a nipping roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Specifically, an acrylic based ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as the ionizing radiation curable resin is applied to a shaping roll <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (having a roll width of 1700 mm) serving as the shaping die having a shape inversing the shape of the lens including the light emitting portion and the fully reflecting portion (wherein the width of the light emitting portion is 50 &mgr;m, the height of the fully reflecting portion is 150 &mgr;m and the pitch is 96 &mgr;m) by a dispenser <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a polyester film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (having a thickness of 188 &mgr;m and a width or 1600 mm) serving as the substrate film to be independently supplied from the upstream is press-fitted to the shaping roll <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> via the acrylic based ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by a nipping roll <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the hardening process, the substrate film press-fitted to the shaping die in the press-fitting process is irradiated with an ionizing radiation, so that the ionizing radiation curable resin is hardened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the substrate film is irradiated with a radiation of 1500 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>while passing an ultraviolet lamp <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, so that the acrylic based ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is hardened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the die removing process, the substrate film is removed from the shaping die, so that the ionizing radiation curable resin hardened in the hardening process is removed from the shaping die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> With this process, the lens layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate film layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (B: Peeling Layer Forming Process) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, it is preferable to perform the peeling layer forming process in which a peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed on the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>before the formation of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in order to readily remove the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the adhesive film in the light emitting portion exposing process, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be formed with a variety of solvent based inks, which is poor in adhesion to metal forming the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, by various coating methods such as gravure. It <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>s however difficult to coat only the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with such a solvent based ink. It is not preferable that the fully reflecting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also is coated with such a solvent based ink since there is a possibility of simultaneous removal of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed on the fully reflecting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the light emitting portion exposing process, which will be performed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In view of this, it is preferable to use a thermal transfer ribbon coated with a peeling layer containing wax in order to selectively form the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at only the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A thermal transfer ribbon in a solid state Is thermally press-fitted to the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, so that a solid material is fused to be shifted to the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby forming the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The solid material preferably contains mainly wax excellent in transferability at the time of transferring and poor in adhesion to metal. The wax preferably has a melting point of 50&deg; C. to 120&deg; C. (by DSC). For example, although there are listed a paraffin wax, a micro crystalline wax, a carnauba wax, a synthetic wax and the like, it is not limited to the above-described kinds of wax. A thermoplastic resin such as a polyester resin or a rubber based resin may be added, as necessary. A ratio of the wax contained in the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably 50% or more and, more preferably, 70% or more. The thickness of the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably 0.01 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m and, more preferably, about 0.1 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m. In consideration of heat resistance and slidability, a heat resistant layer may be formed at a reverse surface of the peeling layer of the thermal transfer ribbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a substrate for use in the thermal transfer ribbon is preferably a plastic film such as polyethylene telephtalate in an arbitrarily selectable thickness of about 2 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a thermal transfer ribbon <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (having a width of 1500 mm) composed by forming a carnauba wax layer (melting point: 82&deg; C.) in a thickness of 1 &mgr;m on a polyester film having a thickness of 12 &mgr;m is supplied and nipped between a heat roll <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which is heated up to 100&deg; C., and a nipping roll <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and then, the carnauba wax material is thermally transferred to the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as a projecting tip, thereby obtaining the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the polyester film as the substrate of the thermal transfer ribbon is peeled off by a taking-up machine <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and finally, taken up by a lens taking-up machine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, thus obtaining a lens-shaped molded product (a molded lens) <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> having the peeling layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (C: Reflecting Layer Forming Process) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This process is to form the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of a highly reflective metal over the entire surface of a lens-shaped portion of the molded lens <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> obtained through the peeling layer forming process by a vacuum film forming method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Here, any metal forming the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be used as long as the metal has a high reflectance; and therefore, silver or aluminum can be used. It is preferable that the reflectance in a visible region should be 85% or more in consideration of light efficiency, and that the spectral reflectance should be flat in order to prevent any coloration in light of a reflected picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a view illustrating the reflecting layer forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The molded lens <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and aluminum <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are set in a sheet feeder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a deposition source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, respectively. A vacuum pump <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> sets a taking-up chamber unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to a degree of vacuum of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>Torr, and further, a deposition chamber unit <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to a degree of vacuum of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Torr, respectively. Thereafter, an electron gun <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shots an electron beam against the aluminum <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> for evaporation. The reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of aluminum is formed on a lens face of the supplied molded lens <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in a thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m and a width of 1500 mm. And then, a molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> having the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed thereon is obtained by taking up by means of a taking-up machine <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> This process is to form the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of a black material over the entire surface of a lens-shaped portion of the molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> obtained after the reflecting layer forming process by a vacuum film forming method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Any material for forming the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be used as long as it is black and can form a film via a vacuum method. In particular, carbon is preferable since it is excellent in light absorbency. Oxides of the metal forming the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be produced by introducing oxygen in the same process after the formation of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that they are preferable as the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> since they are excellent in productivity and low in material cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a view illustrating the BS layer forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, after the completion of the reflecting layer forming process, the taken-out molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is taken over in a direction reverse to the molding direction to be moved to the sheet feeder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> while keeping the same degree of vacuum, and then, the aluminum <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is vaporized by the electron beam. At the same time, oxygen is introduced in 50 cc/min from an oxygen supplying nozzle <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of aluminum oxide in a thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m. Thereafter, it is taken up by the taking-up machine <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining a molded lens <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of aluminum oxide formed on the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed by the various vacuum film forming methods such as a sputtering method or an ion plate method in addition to the vapor deposition method.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the adhesive film sticking process in the present embodiment, the molded lens <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which has been subjected to the vapor deposition, is set in a sheet feeder <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and supplied. A polyester film <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in a thickness of 50 &mgr;m having an acrylic adhesive layer in a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is supplied and nipped between a pressurizing roll <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and a nipping roll <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, to be continuously laminated on the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>covered with the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shifted to the adhesive film by peeling the film by means of an adhesive film taking-up machine <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and thus, are removed from the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(the peeling process). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Here, the apparatus used in the peeling layer forming process may he used as a producing apparatus used in this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The above-described processes can provide the lenticular lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at which the incident light transmits the lens, the fully reflecting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed thereon so as to fully reflect the incident light, and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed on the fully reflecting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> All of these processes are performed in a continuous mode, and therefore, the productivity is high, and further, the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be formed by the use of one and the same vacuum thin film forming equipment, thereby further improving the productivity and reducing the cost of the equipment. Additionally, the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed by the vacuum thin film forming method such as the vapor deposition, thus readily controlling the thickness of the layer. Consequently, it is possible to prevent any unevenness of appearance caused by coating unevenness or drying unevenness, which may be found in a coating method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (F: Front Plate Laminating Process) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The front plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is brought into close contact with the lenticular lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which has been prepared as described above, via the UV adhesive layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and then, is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray, thus completing the lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The completed lens sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is finally cut off in a size of 70 inch square in a batch cutting-off process, thereby obtaining a lenticular lens screen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the present preferred embodiment, it is possible to readily produce the highly accurate lens sheet of a fine pitch at a reduced cost. In particular, since the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of the oxide of the same metal as that of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is advantageous from the viewpoints of the productivity and the material cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, a lens sheet is produced in which a BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of carbon.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a view illustrating a BS layer forming process in a second preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, after the completion of a reflecting layer forming process, a taken-out molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is taken over in a direction reverse to a molding direction to be moved to a sheet feeder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> while keeping the same degree of vacuum. Thereafter, in place of a deposition source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at which aluminum <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> used in the reflecting layer forming process is set, another deposition source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at which carbon <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is set is shifted to a position of the deposition source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The carbon <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> set in the deposition source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is vaporized by an electron beam, thereby forming a BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of carbon in a thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m at a lens face of the molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. And then, the molded lens <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is taken up by a taking-up machine <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, thus obtaining a molded lens <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of carbon formed on a reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Other processes are performed in the sale manner as in the first embodiment, and consequently, a screen is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The resultant screen is installed in a transparent projection television, followed by the outside appearance evaluation, resulting in a uniform picture without any unevenness of the outside appearance and more excellent in contrast than that in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the present preferred embodiment, it is possible to improve the quality of a resulting image since the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Modifications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-described preferred embodiments, and various modifications and alterations can be added thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention as encompassed by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> For example, the front plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may contain a diffusion material therein, thereby further enhancing a diffusion effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in place of the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the BS layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there may be provided a single reflection attenuating layer equipped with the effects of these layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Otherwise, the reflecting layer and the BS layer may be removed from the light emitting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the light emitting portion exposing process not via the adhesive film but by various polishing methods or via an alkaline solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, according to the present invention, since the lens layer is formed on the substrate film layer, the light utilizing efficiency is high in spite of the lens sheet of a fine pitch, and further, the lens sheet can be produced with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In addition, the light attenuating layer is made of the metal oxide film, the basic metal of which is the same as that used for the reflecting layer. Consequently, the producing processes can be simplified, and further, the light attenuating layer can provide a picture excellent in contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the lens sheet producing method comprises: the lens layer shaping process including the press-fitting process, the hardening process and the die removing process; the peeling layer forming process; the reflection attenuating layer forming process including the reflecting layer forming process and the light attenuating layer forming process; the light emitting portion exposing process including the adhesive film sticking process and the peeling process; and the front plate laminating process. Thus, the method can be achieved in the continuous mode with the high productivity, and further, the reflecting layer and the light attenuating layer can be formed in one and the same equipment, thereby further enhancing the productivity and reducing the equipment cost. Additionally, the light attenuating layer is formed by the vacuum film forming method such as the vapor deposition, thereby readily controlling the thickness of the layer. Thus, it is possible to provide the screen which hardly has the uneven of appearance caused by the coating unevenness, the drying unevenness or the like, which has occurred in the conventional coating method. </paragraph>
