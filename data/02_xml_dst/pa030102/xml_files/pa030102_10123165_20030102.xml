<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional semiconductor device is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a plan view of memory cell portion of the semiconductor device. In order to explain relative position of each portion, the drawing assumes that all interlayer insulating layers actually filling spaces between each portion are transparent. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view cut along a centerline of bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, i</cross-reference>.e., a cross-section with respect to the line XII-XII viewed in the direction of arrows. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view cut along a centerline of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, i</cross-reference>.e., a cross-section with respect to the line XIII-XIII viewed in the direction of arrows. A plurality of transfer gates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed linearly and in parallel with each other such that they protrude above the main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as silicon wafer. Within a space between these transfer gates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>each made of conductive material is formed such that it is connected to each bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a regular spacing, to have a shape of approximate ellipse whose major axis is parallel to longitudinal direction of said transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically connected to main surface of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upper side of transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is covered with an interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> bit line contact <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is electrically connected from above lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Bit line contact <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is for electrically connecting bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of conductive material extending horizontally over transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The section over lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and under bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is filled with interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The section over bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is filled with interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> plurality of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> arranged over transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are so-called concave type capacitors. These are cup-type condensers each having a bottom surface on its lower end, and its upper ends open. When cut along a horizontal plane, their cross-sectional shape look like two semicircles opposing to each other with a short distance, joined by parallel sides as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Along this cup-type form, two conductive material parts called storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contact with an insulating layer (not shown) interposed, forming a condenser. Storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> covers outer side of the cup-type form, and is electrically connected to lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed inside the space between transfer gates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Therefore, there are two kinds of lower layer contact: lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connecting bit line contact <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connecting storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The section over storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> where capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not exist is filled with interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Upper surface of interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is covered with cell plate upper surface portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is of a conductive material. Cell plate upper surface portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cell plate upper surface portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are insulated by intermediate insulating layer (not shown) interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a condenser which is desired to have larger capacity. If it has constant thickness (distance from top to bottom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>), it is desirable to enlarge cross-sectional shape of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to obtain larger capacity. In addition, in the case of concave type capacitor, when the aspect ratio as a value of its depth divided by width becomes too large, problem such as defective embedding of electrode material within capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or degradation of etching shape may occur. From this aspect, it is also desired to enlarge the cross-sectional shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, conventional capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are each arranged directly above each storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with its center corresponding to the center of storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>; as the result, capacitors are aligned in square. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> extracts and shows only this arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Enlargement of cross-sectional shape of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be described referring to dimensions a, b, c, and d shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. When enlarging the size of individual capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> themselves kept as it is, it is theoretically possible to enlarge two parameters a and b respectively. Processing of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be difficult, however, if only a becomes longer and the ratio a/b becomes extremely large. Therefore, both a and b must be enlarged together to enlarge the shape of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, thickness of interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which separates neighboring capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> must be larger than a prescribed value to avoid neighboring capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> effecting each other as condensers. When a and b are enlarged together, d rather than c will become the first problem for the thickness of interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since the distance d must have at least a prescribed value, enlargement of a is limited so that there is a dead space <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the area surrounded by four capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device which can minimize dead space in the arrangement of capacitors and maximize shape of individual capacitor, and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above-mentioned object, the semiconductor device according to the present invention includes a semiconductor substrate having a main surface, a plurality of transfer gates formed on the main surface and extending linearly in parallel with each other, lower layer contacts each formed of a conductive material, so as to electrically connect to the main surface in a plurality of spaces respectively formed between the plurality of transfer gates, a plurality of storage node contacts each formed of rod-shaped conductive material extending upwards, and arranged with electrical connection to upper surface of selected ones of the lower layer contacts, and a capacitor formed to have an approximately elliptical cross-sectional shape whose major axis is perpendicular to longitudinal direction of the transfer gate and extending upwards from upper surface of each storage node contact, wherein when the arrangement of the capacitors is seen vertically from above the main surface, rows of capacitors are formed such that, along direction of the major axis, the plurality of capacitors are aligned with regular intervals with a pitch therebetween corresponding approximately two times the sum of width of one transfer gate and width of one space between transfer gates, and when arbitrary one of the capacitor rows is taken as a first capacitor row, a second capacitor row which is another capacitor row is arranged adjacent to and in parallel therewith, and capacitors in the first capacitor row and the second capacitor row are aligned out of phase with each other by the length corresponding approximately to the sum of width of one transfer gate and width of one space between the transfer gates. In this structure, arrangement of capacitors would not be a simple square-shape, and since neighboring capacitor rows are made out of phase with each other by a certain amount, ellipse of individual capacitor can further be enlarged without interfering with ellipse of each capacitor belonging to the neighboring capacitor row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, preferably, when the storage node contacts aligned with electrical connection to upper surface of each of the lower layer contacts aligned in one arbitrary space between the transfer gates is looked from above, the capacitors overlap with centers of the approximate ellipses shifted alternately in opposite sides. By this structure, even if arrangement of storage node contacts has the conventional square shape, new capacitor arrangement based on the present invention described above can be provided thereabove, thereby ensuring connection to storage node contact of each capacitor effectively and reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, preferably, when arbitrary one of the capacitors is taken as a specific capacitor, among other surrounding capacitors, the capacitor diagonally adjacent to it in the direction of the major axis is the closest to above-mentioned specific capacitor. By this structure, wasteful space of the capacitor arrangement can be made as small as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, preferably the semiconductor device includes a plurality of bit lines arranged in parallel with each other and extending perpendicular to the transfer gate in a plane positioned above upper end of the transfer gate and below lower end of the capacitor, and electrically connected to selected lower layer contacts via bit line contacts extending downward from the bit lines. By this structure, since the bit lines are arranged below the capacitors, the difficulty in arranging bit line contacts due to the arrangement of capacitors can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, preferably the capacitor includes a storage node and a cell plate, wherein the storage node is a conductor electrically connected to the storage node contact, having a cross-sectional shape of approximate ellipse and formed as container type having a bottom surface on the lower end and open upper end, while the cell plate is a conductor covering inner surface of the storage node with insulating layer posed therebetween. By this structure, cross-sectional area of each capacitor can be enlarged to make a concave type capacitor with reduced embedding defect or etching shape defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, preferably the capacitor includes a storage node and a cell plate, wherein the storage node is a conductor electrically connected to the storage node contact and is formed in solid, approximate elliptic cylinder form, and the cell plate is a conductor covering outer surface of the storage node with insulating layer posed therebetween. By this structure, since each capacitor has an ellipse shape which can be enlarged sufficiently in the direction of its minor axis, the space between capacitors in the direction of major axis can have sufficient margin and the capacitor can be made as a convex type capacitor with reduced probability of short circuit resulting, for example, from intervening microscopic foreign matters between capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above-mentioned object, the method of the present invention is a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device which includes a semiconductor substrate having a main surface, a plurality of transfer gates formed on the main surface and extending linearly in parallel with each other, lower layer contacts each formed of a conductive material, so as to electrically connect to the main surface in a plurality of spaces respectively formed between the plurality of transfer gates, a plurality of storage node contacts each formed of rod-shaped conductive material extending upwards, and arranged with electrical connection to upper surface of selected ones of the lower layer contacts, and a capacitor formed to have an approximately elliptical cross-sectional shape whose major axis is perpendicular to longitudinal direction of the transfer gate and extending upwards from upper surface of each storage node contact, wherein, in order to form the capacitor, the method comprises a platemaking step of performing platemaking for resist applied on upper surface to form resist pattern using platemaking mask pattern, and an etching step of etching with the resist pattern obtained from the platemaking step, wherein arrangement of the platemaking mask pattern is such that, along direction of the major axis, the plurality of capacitors are aligned with regular intervals with a space therebetween being approximately the width of one transfer gate, forming capacitor rows, and when arbitrary one of the capacitor rows is taken as first capacitor row, a second capacitor row which is another capacitor row is arranged adjacent to and in parallel therewith, and capacitors in the first capacitor row and the second capacitor row are aligned out of phase with each other by the length corresponding approximately to the sum of width of one transfer gate and width of one space between the transfer gates. By this method, the semiconductor device can be obtained of which capacitor has not a simple square-shape but an arrangement in which neighboring capacitor rows are made out of phase with each other by a prescribed amount. Thus, semiconductor device having capacitors with enlarged cross-sectional shape can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the invention above, as above-mentioned platemaking mask pattern, it is preferable to use the platemaking mask pattern having cross pattern at portions where approximate ellipse pattern should be formed. By this method, platemaking mask pattern for forming approximate ellipse shape capacitor can be provided only with straight lines, even if it is impossible to make platemaking mask pattern of curved figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

Structures of semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, interlayer insulating layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are similar to those of corresponding parts of the prior art semiconductor device described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Cross-sectional view cut along a centerline of bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and therefore the description will not be repeated here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Since individual capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a concave type capacitor and the structure is also similar to that of prior art semiconductor device described above, the description will not be repeated here. Storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is also electrically connected to lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As will be clear by comparison between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, this semiconductor device is different from the conventional semiconductor device with respect to cross-sectional shape of individual capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or relative position of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device of this embodiment, cross-sectional shape of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an approximate ellipse rather than the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Major axis of the approximate ellipse is perpendicular to longitudinal direction of transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, the arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in this semiconductor device is such that, along the direction of major axis of approximate ellipse (left-to-right direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), a plurality of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are aligned with regular intervals with a pitch therebetween corresponding approximately two times the sum of width of one transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and width of one space between transfer gates, forming capacitor rows. When arbitrary one of the capacitor rows is taken as a first capacitor row, a second capacitor row which is another capacitor row is arranged adjacent to and in parallel therewith, and capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the first capacitor row and the second capacitor row are aligned out of phase with each other by the length corresponding approximately to the sum of width of one transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and width of one space between the transfer gates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Though arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is as such, arrangement of storage node contacts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is the same as conventional one. As the result, center of storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and center of capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shifted from each other in the direction of major axis of approximate ellipse as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Furthermore, the manner of shifting is such that, when looking at each capacitor row one after another along longitudinal direction of transfer gate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (up-to-down direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), centers of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shifted in opposite directions on alternate rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, when storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> aligned with electrical connection to upper surface of each lower layer contact <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>aligned in one arbitrary space between transfer gates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is looked from above, we can say that capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> overlap with centers of the approximate ellipses shifting alternately in opposite sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> extracts and shows only the arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Since capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have approximate ellipse shape as described above and form the arrangement in which they are shifted on alternate rows as described above, when arbitrary one of the capacitors is taken as a specific capacitor, among other surrounding capacitors, the capacitor diagonally adjacent to it in the direction of the major axis can be the closest to above-mentioned specific capacitor. That is, distance L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be shorter than C or D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since arrangement of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not have a simple square shape but is shifted on alternate rows as described above, when the ellipse is to be enlarged, minor axis of the ellipse will be prolonged just towards the space between capacitors in adjacent capacitor rows, even if major axis and minor axis are prolonged simultaneously. Therefore, minor axis can be prolonged to ensure the large ellipse shape. According to this arrangement, capacitor with larger cross-sectional shape compared to conventional one can be obtained, since only the distance between diagonally adjacent capacitors, i. e., distance L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, should be kept equal to or above the minimum thickness of interlayer insulating layer necessary between capacitors. In addition, dead space can be made smaller than that of the conventional device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the relation of arrangement between capacitors and bit lines is generally based on COB (Capacitor On Bit-Line) system or CUB (Capacitor Under Bit-Line) system. In the semiconductor device in this embodiment, the COB system in which capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stacked above bit line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is taken. In contrast, in case of CUB system in which bit line is stacked above capacitor, bit line contact for connecting bit line to lower layer contact had to connect to lower layer contact through space between capacitors. In case of capacitors arranged in square as conventional, to design bit line contact to go through the space between capacitors in the CUB system was easy, since the space was relatively wide. In the semiconductor device of this embodiment, however, space between capacitors becomes narrower so that it would be disadvantageous to take the CUB system. In contrast, such a problem does not occur and arrangement of capacitors can be determined in the COB system. Therefore, it is more preferable to apply the present invention to the COB system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device in the second embodiment according to the present invention will be described. In semiconductor device in the first embodiment, capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was a concave type capacitor. In contrast, in semiconductor device in this embodiment, capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a convex type capacitor. The plan view is similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows cross-sectional view cut along the plane corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has approximately elliptical cross-sectional shape when cut along a horizontal plane, and has solid, approximately elliptical cylinder form. Inside thereof is filled with conductive material, providing a storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. For storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>covers its outer surface with an insulating layer (not shown) therebetween. Storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opposing as such with insulating layer interposed provides a condenser. Cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to cell plate upper surface portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically connected with storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and storage node contact <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are insulated from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, all of the elements are similar to that of the first embodiment except for the convex type capacitor substituted for concave type capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, similar effect as the first embodiment can also be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A method of manufacturing semiconductor device in the third embodiment according to the present invention will be described. This method is the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device described in the first embodiment. First, the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is formed with known technique. Then interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is stacked on an upper surface to obtain the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> resist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is applied on the whole upper surface, and photomechanical step is performed using platemaking mask pattern. In this example, platemaking mask pattern of arranged pattern of ellipse shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is used. In case that it is difficult to make ellipse shape corresponding to individual capacitor as platemaking mask pattern, the pattern may include cross shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> instead of ellipse shape. To set this cross shape, each parameter p, q, r, and s is set after optimization as appropriate by simulation, for example. Platemaking is performed using such a platemaking mask pattern, and resist pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed from resist <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This state is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Etching of interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is performed using resist pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a mask, and resulting state is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Resist pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is removed thereafter, and then storage node <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, insulating layer and cell plate cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are stacked sequentially inside the concave portion of interlayer insulating layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to complete capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and thereby semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, in comparison with manufacturing of conventional semiconductor device, the semiconductor device described in the first embodiment according to the present invention can be manufactured simply by using a substituted platemaking mask pattern. In addition, though cross-sectional shape of individual capacitor is aimed to be approximate ellipse shape, the shape provided to platemaking mask pattern is not necessarily ellipse; even if the shape is cross, resist pattern of approximate ellipse can actually be formed by blur of exposure during photomechanical step. Therefore, platemaking mask pattern can be constructed only with straight lines where it is impossible to make platemaking mask pattern of curved figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, arrangement of capacitors would not be a simple square-shape, and since neighboring capacitor rows are made out of phase with each other by a certain amount, ellipse of individual capacitor can further be enlarged without interfering with ellipse of each capacitor belonging to the neighboring capacitor row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
