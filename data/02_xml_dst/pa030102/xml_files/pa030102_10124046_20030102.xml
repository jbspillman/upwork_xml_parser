<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> a. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to control and suspension systems for coverings for architectural openings such as doors, windows, and the like. More particularly the present invention relates to a remotely-controllable powered system for configuring a covering having a plurality of vertically suspended vanes that are moveable between extended and retracted positions as well as open and closed positions to control visibility and the passage of light through the architectural opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> b. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Coverings for architectural openings such as doors, windows, and the like have been known in various forms for many years. One form of such covering is commonly referred to as a vertical vane covering wherein a control system suspends and is operable to selectively manipulate a plurality of vertically suspended vanes such that the vanes can be moved laterally across the architectural opening to extend or retract the covering, and pivoted (or tilted) about longitudinal vertical axes to open and close the vanes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Control systems for operating vertical vane coverings typically include a headrail in which a plurality of carriers, one associated with each vane, are movably mounted for lateral movement and include internal mechanisms for pivoting the vanes about their vertical axes. The headrails vary in construction and configuration to house the various types of carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, while the prior art includes many different forms of control systems and headrails in which various types of carriers are movably mounted, they each would benefit from an easily-operated, powered control system. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The powered control system of the present invention is adapted for use in a covering for an architectural opening that includes a plurality of carriers supported by a headrail for independently traversing and pivoting (or tilting) connected vertical vanes used in the covering. The control system includes a translational drive system for selectively moving the vanes between an extended position and a retracted position (i.e., traversing the vanes); and an angular drive system for selectively pivoting or rotating the vanes about pivot axes parallel to, or collinear with, the vane longitudinal axes, between an opened angular position and a closed angular position (i.e., tilting the vanes). Each carrier is mounted on the headrail for sliding movement and supports a single vane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As part of the translational drive system, the plurality of carriers are interconnected by a scissors-type (or pantograph) linkage so that the vanes suspended by the carriers can be stacked adjacent one side (single-draw system) or both sides (double-draw or center-draw system) of an architectural opening when the covering is retracted, but are uniformly spaced when the covering is extended to cover all or a portion of the architectural opening. In the preferred embodiment, the scissors-type linkage is disposed above the headrail. In the single-draw system depicted in, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> lead one of the carriers is connected to a beaded traverse cord and is moveable by the beaded cord longitudinally of the headrail (i.e., transversely of the opening adjacent to which the architectural covering is mounted), and this movement of the lead carrier causes the remaining follower carriers to move therewith by action of the scissors-type linkage. The present invention includes additional hardware and firmware comprising a powered control system to enable remote operation and control of the translational drive system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As part of the angular drive system, each carrier includes components to enable rotation (i.e., tilting) of the vanes about pivot axes substantially parallel to, or substantially collinear with, the vanes&apos; longitudinal, vertical axes. For example, each carrier could include a rack and pinion system for pivoting a suspended vane. This rack and pinion system, which is operatively engaged with a tilt rod that runs the length of the headrail, is fully disclosed in related U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/525,613, which has been incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Alternatively, the components that enable tilting of the vanes could include the meshing gear system that is also fully disclosed in related U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/525,613. The tilt rod is mounted for rotative movement about its longitudinal axis such that selective rotation of the tilt rod in either rotative direction effects reversible pivotal movement of the vanes about their vertical longitudinal axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A system for covering an architectural opening according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a powered control system having a translational drive system operatively engaging a vane to cause selective translational movement of the vane along a guide rail. The powered control system also includes an angular drive system that causes selective rotation of the vane to different angular positions relative to the guide rail. Additionally, a logic system is operatively connected to the translational drive system and to the angular drive system to control and monitor translational motion and angular motion of the vane with respect to the guide rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a system for covering an architectural opening according to the present invention includes a headrail and at least one tilt rod rotatably mounted with respect to said headrail. At least one carrier is operatively mounted on the tilt rod to allow the carrier to translationally move along the tilt rod. A hanger pin is pivotally attached to the at least one carrier, and a first gear train is operatively associated with the at least one carrier and operatively attached between the tilt rod and the hanger pin. At least one vane is operatively attached to the hanger pin. A drive cord is formed in a loop and extends along the headrail and the at least one carrier is attached to the drive cord. This embodiment also includes a powered control system having a translational drive system operatively engaging the drive cord for selective translational movement of the at least one vane along the headrail. The powered control system also includes an angular drive system operatively engaging the tilt rod to cause selective rotation of the at least one vane to different angular positions relative to the headrail, and a logic system operatively connected to the translational drive system and to the angular drive system to control and monitor the translational motion and angular motion of the at least one vane with respect to the headrail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other aspects, features, and details of the present invention can be more completely understood by reference to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the drawings and from the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A vertical blind covering system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and includes a control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprising a translational drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can comprise a microprocessor as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>. In the schematic vertical blind system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are slidably supported on a tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is suspended from each carrier by a hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected to the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by an angular rotation gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), which is known in the art. The angular rotation gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> allows a user to control the angular position of the vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a vertical axis by rotating the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the instant invention, an angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached at one end of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to allow the user to remotely control the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The movement of each carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in translation is controlled by the translation drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is part of the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that require common movement are attached together by a pantograph structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the translation drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a drive cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending in a loop around two pulleys <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The drive cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is attached selectively to two carriers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to create a center opening vane system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or is attached to one carrier <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to create an end-collecting blind system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for a center opening blind system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the front span of the drive cord is attached to a central carrier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the rear span of the drive cord is attached to an adjacent carrier <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> such that when the drive cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rotated in the loop, the front span moves the carrier it is attached to oppositely from the carrier attached to the rear span of the drive cord. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for an end collection blind system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, only one of the front or rear spans of the drive cord needs to be attached to an end carrier <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> depending on which end the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are to be collected on. In both the blinds systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the angular rotation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are collectively controlled separately from the translational movement of the carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Again, the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> controls the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while the translational drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls the location of the carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the tilt rods <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The translational drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, along with the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, together make up the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as is described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is primarily described herein as it relates to an end collection blind system as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>; however, application of the control system to a center opening blind system as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is contemplated and would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the vanes are each attached to an adjacent vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a strip of fabric connecting the adjacent front edges of each vane to one another. This is mere design choice, as the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be each separate from one another with no interconnection other than through the drive system, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As a result of the interconnection of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotate angularly about a vertical axis, approximately 180 degrees from the closed position through an open position and back to a closed position by the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In other words, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can rotate until the front edge of each vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contacts the rear edge of the adjacent vane to either side (at which point the widths of the vanes are generally linearly aligned). Generally, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are always parallel to one another. The angular open position is defined by the vanes extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of a headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which position is also generally orthogonal to the translational movement of the vanes (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In the traversing or translational movement of the carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> move from an expanded position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to a retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Partially retracted positions are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>.

Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> portion of the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is made up of a small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>) operatively attached to a drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is in turn operatively engaged with a driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The driven slave gear includes a worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> thereupon for actuating the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is engaged to the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such that when the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is actuated, the drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> drives the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which in turn actuates the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to rotate the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to change the angular orientation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the blind system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes a drive gear shaft <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having a lower end defining a keyed recess to mate with the output shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The output shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends into the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, through the main housing&apos;s bottom wall.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> A plurality of longitudinally extending gear teeth are positioned on the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> adjacent to the axle end. These longitudinal gear teeth form the drive unit actuator gear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which engages the worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the shaft of the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. As the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is rotated by the drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> engages with the drive unit actuator gear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to cause the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to rotate about its longitudinal axis. Spaced away from the drive unit actuator gear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, an indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extends radially from the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and is formed approximately halfway around the circumference of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 32</cross-reference>. The indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, as described in greater detail below, helps the logic system determine the angular orientation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at any given time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Spaced away from the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, an annular groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extending all the way around the circumference of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is formed for receiving the sidewall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in combination with a positioning tang <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) extending downwardly from the lid <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This holds the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> properly in the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. The wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and tang <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being received in the annular groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> keeps the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> from moving axially into or out of the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In combination with the axle end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> being held in position as described above, the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is securely positioned within the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> yet is able to rotate about its longitudinal axis when actuated by the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The end of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> opposite the axle end defines a recess <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 27</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) having keyed multi-lobed shape.

This allows the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in only one orientation and also in a torque transferring relationship so that when the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is rotated, the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to the same extent. The tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is the portion of the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that extends out of the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to engage the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which itself extends within the framework of the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In effect, because the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is substantially concealed in the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the only moving part with respect to the angular drive system that engages the blind system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to cause the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate is the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>.

As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> also includes a beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and a positioning disk <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is defined by a top bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and a bottom bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, each of which extends radially and continuously around the main shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The bottom bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is positioned very close to the end of the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 41</cross-reference>. Bead pockets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> are formed in the bottom bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and can extend all the way therethrough, to form apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, if desired (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>), to receive the beads on the bead drive cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as the beaded cord is wrapped around the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and along the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Extending at substantially right angles to the bead pockets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and longitudinally with the shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, are curved indentations <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> in the shaft which also receive a portion of the bead in conjunction with the bead pockets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The bead pockets and the curved indentations <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are sized to correspond to the dimensions and shape of the bead structures <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>) on the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and help seat and grip the beaded structures for efficient driving of the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the translational drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bottom bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may have a larger radius than the radius of the top bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to allow the bead elements of the beaded cord to more easily enter the beaded cord channel and seat in the bead pockets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends around the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, when actuated by the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, rotates to move the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a loop around the pulley <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) positioned at the opposite end of the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends along the headrail and, as described above, is attached to a primary carrier <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for an end stack configured vertical blind system or to two different adjacent central carriers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for a center draw vertical blind system) in order to drive the carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can rotate the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> around the loop in either direction depending on the actuation of the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Referring back to FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, between the upper positioning pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the top bead alignment wall <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the circular flange <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> extends circumferentially around and radially from the shaft of the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Radially extending tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are formed on the outer circumference of the circular flange <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and are equally spaced. These tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are position indicator tabs and, as described below, allow the logic system to determine to what extent the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are retracted or expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 22</cross-reference>, the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> containing the integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and other required electronic components is shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is shown with two sets of plug contacts <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> extending from one end. These plug contacts extend through the sidewall of the main housing body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to allow connection with the wireless sensor signal plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the power input plug <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The side of the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is considered the back side of the circuit board. The front side of the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. It is to be appreciated that the integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may also be mounted on the front side of the circuit board as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Additionally, several chips may be utilized in place of a single integrated chip. Other electronic components may also be mounted to the circuit board as would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. The front side also includes two sensors, an angular position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for detecting the angular position of the vanes, and a translational position sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for detecting the expanded or retracted translational position of the vanes. The angular position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is typically U-shaped, with a channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> formed between its legs for receiving the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> can detect when the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is present in the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, which in turn is interpreted by the logic system to determine the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, to detect the translationary position of the vanes, is also typically U-shaped defining a channel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. This sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is able to determine when the position indicator tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are present in the channel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, thus permitting the logic system to determine whether the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are retracted or expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 31</cross-reference>, the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> defines a first radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and a second radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. In one example, the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> detects when each of the edges passes through the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the sensor may detect two positions of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the tilt drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is configured for 360 degrees of rotational movement and is arranged so that the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the open position and the angular position of the vanes in the closed position correlates with the first edge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the second edge <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this arrangement, the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> notifies the logic system that the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are either closed or open. Additionally, the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may be configured to detect the presence or absence of the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, by detecting the transition from the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> being outside the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> being inside the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, or by detecting the transition from the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> being inside the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> being outside the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the logic system is able to differentiate between the first edge and the second edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A, 29A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, an alternative tilt drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>&prime; defines a first indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime; and a second indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime;. It is to be appreciated that the alternative embodiment tilt drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>&prime; is substantially similar to the preferred tilt drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> except for differences concerning the indicator flanges. The first indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime; defines a first radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and a second radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, and the second indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime; also defines a first radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> and a second radially-extending edge <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. As described previously, each vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates angularly about a vertical axis, rotating approximately 180 degrees from the a first closed position, past the fully open position, and back to a second closed position. Preferably, the tilt drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>&prime; is arranged so that the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the first closed position, in the fully open position, and in the second closed position each correlates with one of the edges (<highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>) on either the first indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime; or the second indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime;. In this arrangement, preferably the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> notifies the logic system that the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the first closed position, the fully open position, or the second closed position. In one example, the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> detects when one of the four edges (<highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>) passes through the channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and also detects the presence or the absence of one of the indicator flanges (<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&Prime;) in the channel. Accordingly, the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may detect up to four different positions of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> At the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the lid <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is shown for covering the open top end of the main body housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> attaches to the main body housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by four fastening screws <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also defines, as described above, three apertures for receiving various ends of components positioned within the housing. The underside of the lid is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</cross-reference>. The top of the lid is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 10</cross-reference>, and the edge of the lid that includes the positioning tang <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>.

The main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B, 13</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes several features that help facilitate the positioning of various components therein. For instance, on an inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 13</cross-reference>) is formed. The edge of the U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> fits into the groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> formed around the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and works in conjunction with the drive unit positioning tang <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) to help secure the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in position while allowing it to rotate. The support post <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the floor of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and defines the recess <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for receiving the axial end of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, as described above. The floor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the main housing defines two keyed apertures <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) for receiving the top ends of the motors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Alternative housing configurations are contemplated based on various design and aesthetic considerations that would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</cross-reference>, the top ends of each of the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively, include the output shaft <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a pair of diametrically opposed positioning pins <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The larger keyed aperture <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> formed in the bottom wall of the main housing receives the top end of the larger motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A mount bushing <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, is first positioned on top of the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that the positioning pins <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> on the top of the motor are received in the outer slots <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the mount bushing <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The output shaft extends through a central aperture <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> in the mount bushing <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The mount bushing <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> has a shape on its top surface that mates with the keyed aperture <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The mount bushing <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> provides the torque resistance to cause the motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to turn the shaft <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> when actuated. Without the torque resistance, when the motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> was actuated and a load applied to the motor shaft <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the motor itself would turn instead of the motor shaft turning. In an alternative embodiment, the mounting bushings may be integral with the bottom wall of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Further, it is contemplated that other types of motors may be utilized without positioning pins and other structures such as clamps are utilized to fixedly secure the motors in the housing structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> An alternative main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime; is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</cross-reference> and is generally similar to housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment. There are two primary differences between the main housings. Most noticeably, the alternative housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime; includes several screw bosses <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that extend upwardly from the floor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime;. Secondly, in place of the free standing circuit board back brace <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the preferred main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the alternative main housing includes a back brace <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>&prime; that extends from a new screw boss <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> that is attached to a side wall of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B, 13</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also show a beaded cord slot <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> formed in the inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> below the slot <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord slot <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> allows the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to enter into and exit from the main body without any interference. On the opposite wall of the main body, a similar slot <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed. However, this similar slot receives a beaded cord guide <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). The beaded cord guide <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> mounts from the outside of the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and extends through the slot <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to capture the length of the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is wrapped around and in engagement with the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 16</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> show various views of the beaded cord guide <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The curved front surface <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the beaded cord guide <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> basically keeps the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from disengaging from the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the bead pockets <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The curved surface <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the beaded cord guide <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> does not contact the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> unless the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> tries to disengage from the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In alternative embodiments, a cord guide may be integrally formed with the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the outer surface of the inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> defines mounting rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for use in attaching the main body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, which is attached to the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>, allows the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be attached to the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art, is generally U-shaped with an upwardly open channel <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> formed along the free edge of each leg (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>). It is to be appreciated that other headrail configurations are contemplated and the connector brackets will vary as necessary to mount to the alternative headrails. The connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> has two attachment structures, one on its front face <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and one on its rear face <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. The attachment structure on the front face <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is a U-shaped recess <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> that matches the U-shape of the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> such that an end of the headrail can be inserted into the U-shaped recess <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. Two fastening screws <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are used to fasten the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> onto the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The fastening screws <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> fit through apertures <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>) formed in the backside of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and extend into the channels <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> on the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to secure the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B, 25</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the backside <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> defines mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> along each opposing edge. The mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> are formed to mate with corresponding mounting rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> formed on the inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42, 43</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> provide views of the engagement of the mounting rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> with the mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and mounting rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are designed with a downwardly opening V-shape (the distance between the two rails increases from top to bottom, and the distance between the two channels increases from top to bottom) such that the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be slid onto the mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> from the top, but then wedges into place when properly seated. The width of the mounting channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> also decreases from top to bottom, as do the rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> so that the rails <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> become wedged in the channels <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> as a second means of seating the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with respect to the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. In addition, a tab <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>) is formed on the bottom edge of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to engage the bottom of the inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to also act as a positioning stop. This tab <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> engages the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is placed on the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> as an extra measure to ensure that the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are properly aligned with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> A horizontal extending oval slot <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 47</cross-reference>) is formed through the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to mate up with the slot <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> formed through the inwardly-facing wall <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes through both slots <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> without interference. A central U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) is formed in the middle of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to allow the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to extend therethrough without interference by the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. On the front face <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, inwardly of the U-shaped recess <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> and outwardly of the U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, two mounting apertures <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are positioned for receiving a screw <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 48</cross-reference>) through at least one of them to attach the first carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the front side <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. This will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As described above, the component parts required for both the translational drive system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are primarily contained within the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As part of the angular drive system, each carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes components to enable rotation (i.e., tilting) of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about pivot axes parallel to, or collinear with., the vanes&apos; longitudinal, vertical axes. For example, each carrier could include a rack and pinion system for pivoting (or tilting) a suspended vane. This rack and pinion system, which is operatively engaged with a tilt rod that runs the length of the headrail, is fully disclosed in related U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/525,613, which has been incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Alternatively, the components that enable tilting of the vanes could include the meshing gear system that is also fully disclosed in related U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/525,613. The tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted for rotational movement about its longitudinal axis such that selective rotation of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in either rotational direction effects reversible pivotal movement of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their vertical longitudinal axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> A more detailed description of the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be made with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> is a top isometric view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> is a top plan view, of the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the lid <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> removed. These figures show the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which includes the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</cross-reference>), the drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> attached to the top of the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> engaged to the drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> engaged with the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> engaged with the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. As the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is actuated, the motor shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> rotates, thus turning the drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The drive gear <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which rotates in a horizontal plane, engages the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which also rotates in a horizontal plane. The worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>) formed on the shaft below the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> engages the drive unit actuator gear <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> on the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>), which converts the rotation of the horizontally positioned gears about a vertical axis to the rotation of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> about a horizontal axis. The actuation of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by the worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the driven slave gear member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> causes the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to rotate. The rotation of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in turn causes the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to angularly move because of the gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> positioned in the carriers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which transfer the rotation of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> along its longitudinal axis to the angular rotation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along a vertical axis. The gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the carrier is shown in part in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> wherein the idler gear <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> in the first carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted to the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is shown. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>, the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is shown with its motor shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> engaged with the bottom end of the lower end <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the drive gear shaft. The interaction of the worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with the drive unit actuator gear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shown also. It is to be appreciated that other combinations and configurations of gears may be utilized to effectively couple a motor, such as the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, to a tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> shows the relationship of the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with the angular position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> mounted on the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> rotates about its horizontal axis, the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> rotates in a vertical plane about the horizontal axis also. The sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is positioned on the circuit board such that this flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> passes between the two legs of the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is designed to sense when the flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is present and when the flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is not present, thus indicating to the logic system the angular orientation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the sensor is a photo sensor which works with the flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to allow the logic system to know when the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated all the way to either side as well as in the open position. Other types of sensors may be utilized as well. For example, a magnetic induction type sensor could be utilized in conjunction with a ferrous indicator flange. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, the right radial edge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is just impinging on the central region <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) of the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. If the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is rotated counterclockwise from this position the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> will move out of the sensors range. If the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise, the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> will move through the central region <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. As explained elsewhere herein, the logic system interprets these signals in order to determine the angular position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> also shows the worm gear <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the driven slave gear <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as well as the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> positioned in the beaded cord channel <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The circuit board shield <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is also clearly illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> through the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, with the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in the same position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> also shows the fasteners <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> used to hold the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as well as the fastener <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> used to hold the first carrier <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Also, the slot <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> in the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is shown through which the beaded cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes and which is coextensive with the slot <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> formed in the front wall of the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for that purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a keyed outer surface configuration that includes approximately one-half of the circumference forming radially extending splines <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> with the balance of the outer circumference forming a relatively smooth enlarged lobe <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</cross-reference> also). These structures extend along the entire length of the tilt rod. This outer surface configuration is designed to be received securely and nonrotatably within the corresponding keyed recess <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 31</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. In the middle of the enlarged lobe portion <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>, there is a relatively small protrusion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</cross-reference>, this protrusion is the web material created when two of the tilt rods <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> are made by an extrusion process as a pair. The protrusion forms a web between two tilt rods <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> during the extrusion process, providing lateral and dimensional stability between the two rods as they are formed. Extruding two rods at one time creates efficiencies in the manufacture of the dual-extruded rods <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the added rigidity of the pair of tilt rods <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> during extrusion and subsequent cooling minimizes the amount of longitudinal bend or warp introduced into the tilt rods during fabrication. These rods can be used in blind systems incorporating the present invention, as well as in other types of blind systems. It is appreciated that the actual outer surface configuration of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (one tilt rod of a tilt rod pair <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>) may vary as long as it is configured to keyably interface with corresponding structures of the translational drive system and the carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Returning to the angular drive system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view along line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, adjacent to a carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In each carrier, a worm gear <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is positioned on the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such that when the tilt rod turns the worm gear turns. The worm gear <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is in engagement with the angular rotation gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is in turn connected to the hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which holds the vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The angular rotation gear train <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a transitional gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which changes the rotation of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> around a horizontal axis to the rotation of the transition gear member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> about a vertical axis. The transition gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> has a top gear structure, which engages an idler gear <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, which in turn engages a gear <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>) mounted on the top of the hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. So as the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated, the worm gear <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> mounted on the outside of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> inside the carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotated, which in turn engages a transition gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which in turn rotates and idler gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which in turn rotates the gear <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>) mounted on the hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to change the angular orientation of the vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> attached to the hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> are two links of the pantograph structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> attached to the top of the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Looking at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</cross-reference> together, when the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is rotated clockwise as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also rotated clockwise. The transition gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> however is rotated then counterclockwise, which then rotates the idler gear <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> clockwise, which in turn rotates the gear <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> on the top of the hanger pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> counterclockwise, which finally causes the vane <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to move in a counterclockwise direction around a vertical axis (as viewed from the top as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> shows the engagement of the worm gear <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> on the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the transition gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in the carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> also shows clearly the attachment of the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> by two threaded screws <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The threaded screws <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> each are positioned through an aperture <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> in the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and extend into the channels <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 47</cross-reference>) at the ends of the legs of the U forming the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The screw <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is shown fixing the first carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the connector bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The engagement of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is also shown, with a space <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> being left between the end of the keyed cavity <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> near the end of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to allow for changes in length of the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the tilt rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is flexed and bent to the extent that occurs.

<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention includes a motorized control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for opening and closing, and for extending and retracting, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of an architectural covering like the one depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53, 54</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>G. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> is a schematic elevation of a covering for an architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The covering includes a plurality of vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be distributed across the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>, or retracted to one or both sides of the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference> depicts the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being retracted to the left side of the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference> depicts the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fully retracted to the left side of the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. In each of FIGS. <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are tilted or rotated about their longitudinal axes (or axes parallel to their longitudinal axes) to be oriented perpendicularly to the direction of extension and retraction. This configuration can be seen by looking at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>D, which is a top plan view taken along line <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> and showing the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in their fully expanded and fully open configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be not only extended (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>) and retracted (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</cross-reference>), but also tilted or rotated about vertical axes (FIGS. <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>G). FIGS. <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>G depict a possible series of angular positions for the vertical vanes when they start from a fully closed configuration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56A</cross-reference>), where they have been rotated fully counter-clockwise, and then are transitioned through the clockwise rotation of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56B and 56C</cross-reference>) to their fully open configuration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56D</cross-reference>), and then continue to be rotated clockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56E and 56F</cross-reference> until they reach their opposite, fully-closed configuration depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>G, where the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated fully clockwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the logic system of the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>) receives infrared (IR) signals <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> from a remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> (also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>). The logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> running a main operating program decodes the IR signal (IRS) to determine whether a user wants to (i) open or close the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise about vertical axes, (ii) extend the covering across an architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, or (iii) retract the covering to one or both sides of the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The block diagram depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> depicts the hardware comprising a typical control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> incorporating the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The hardware includes a large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to extend and retract (i.e., traverse) the covering horizontally. The small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is used to rotate (i.e., tilt) the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their longitudinal axes or about axes that are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axes of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A relative, nondirectional shaft encoder (comprising the translational position sensor and the tabbed beaded cord drive member in the preferred embodiment) is present to detect turns of the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A cam- or flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (comprising the angular position sensor and the flanged tilt rod drive unit of the preferred embodiment) is present to detect if the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated counter-clockwise or clockwise or fully open. The control system hardware further includes two H-bridge power amplifiers <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> to drive the small <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and large <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> motors. An IR receiver <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is present to receive IR signals from the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a PIC microprocessor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> contained within the integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is present to run the operational logic or program. Finally, a power source is present to power the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>, the power source is a battery <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the power source could be in AC power cord <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and transformer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the operational logic is typically contained in the main operational program, which is preferably resident in nonvolatile memory within the microprocessor or a separate memory chip. During power-up, the program is loaded into the microprocessor for directing the operation of the logic system. In alternative embodiments, however, the hard-wired integrated circuits may be used in place of a program and microprocessor, wherein the configuration of the hard-wired circuits determine the operation of the logic and control systems. Further, any suitable combination of hard-wired circuits and configurable circuits in conjunction with one or more operating programs may be utilized as would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> hardware shown diagrammatically or schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> is shown in greater detail in other figures. For example, the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference> could be used to send infrared signals <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> to the infrared receiver <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>, the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> preferably includes a frequency or channel selection switch <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, and a control rocker switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> permitting two different signals to be sent on each of the selected channels. In the preferred embodiment of the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is powered by a plurality of batteries (not shown) mounted in the remote control unit <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> itself. A remote control signal <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is generated when the control rocker switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is pressed. </paragraph>

Similarly, the small drive motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is depicted isometrically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> depicts the top end of the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, including its output shaft <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> depicts the bottom or lower end of the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 44</cross-reference> clearly depict how the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is mounted to the main housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the control system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Portions of the IR receiver <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> may also be seen in, for example, FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment depicted in the drawings, the wireless control signal sensor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> comprises a fiber optic cable, which routes the incoming IR signal to the integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that is clearly visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The cam- or flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> that is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> comprises multiple components depicted in the other figures. For example, the flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> comprising part of the tilt rod drive unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 27</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). It also includes the vane angular position detector or sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> that is clearly visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and visible in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, the angular position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is an option detector. The flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> detects when the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in their fully-open configuration (e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>D) by detecting when a radial edge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the vane angular position indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> passes by the flange position detector <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, as clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. With this interaction between the vane angular position indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the angular position sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, the logic system knows when the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) and when they are fully centered. The logic system does not necessarily know the precise extent to which the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated, but the logic system knows precisely when the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in their fully-open configuration since, at that moment, the radial edge <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the indicator flange <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> passes by the position sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The relative, nondirectional shaft encoder depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> also comprises multiple components that are shown to good advantage in other figures. The shaft encoder includes, for example, the position indicator tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) comprising part of the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. These position indicator tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extend radially outward from the axis of rotation of the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which is also clearly shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 50</cross-reference>, the position indicator tabs pass through a second detector <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> mounted to the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that carries the integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Once the logic system registers a digital position to a physical position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the horizontal headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the relative, nondirectional shaft encoder is able to determine whether the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are fully extended across the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, fully retracted to one or both sides of the architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, or somewhere in-between. In particular, the logic system knows how far the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> move horizontally with each passing of a position indicator tab <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the tab sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. By calculating how much the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has rotated under the influence of the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the logic can calculate the relative horizontal position of the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the headrail <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Since the translational position sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment is nondirectional, it cannot determine whether the beaded cord drive member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise. The logic system, however, knows which button has been pressed on the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> when the channel selection switch <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is in the position that permits the IR signals to carry extension and retraction information. With the two pieces of information, the logic system can determine how retracted or extended the covering is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> that is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference> incorporates some of the circuits depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, as previously mentioned, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> that runs the main operator program is a PIC microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Although the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprising the covering may be tilted or rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise to regulate the transmission of light or air through an architectural opening <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, in the preferred embodiment the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must typically be oriented perpendicularly to the traversing direction <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>) before the covering can traverse. Thus, the main operating program of the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes logic instructions to ensure that the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are properly oriented before traversing commences. As mentioned above, the IR remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment includes a rocker switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and a channel selector <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. When the traverse channel (channel 1) is selected and &ldquo;position 1&rdquo; is activated, the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will pivot (as necessary) until they are fully open and then make the covering move leftwardly (in FIGS. <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) until either the button is released or the covering reaches the leftmost end of travel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>). Similarly, when &ldquo;position 2&rdquo; is pressed, the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will pivot (as necessary) until they are fully open and then move rightwardly (i.e., in the opposite direction from the direction <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>) until they are fully extended as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> When the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is first powered up, it has no idea where the covering is positioned on the headrail. However, when powered up and in use after a power-up initialization, the logic system, using the positioning indicator radially extending tabs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the translational position sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, is able to keep track of how far the covering has traveled and the coverings position in whichever direction the covering is traversing. When the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> determines that the covering, which is moving leftwardly (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>) has stopped, it assumes that the blind has reached the leftward limit of its travel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> sets the relative position of the covering as being at its left limit. In the preferred embodiment, this position becomes the digital retraction limit, which the logic system assumes corresponds with the physical retraction limit (in other words, the logic system assumes that the covering is fully retracted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>). The logic system similarly learns the right limit, which is the digital extension limit (in other words, for the digital extension limit, the logic system assumes the covering is fully extended as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Once the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> learns the left and right digital limits, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> during a traversing operation, will stop the covering before it reaches the corresponding physical limits to avoid undue wear on the hardware due to the rapid deceleration of impacting a physical limit. It is possible that the covering may be stopped by an obstruction before reaching a limit. If that were to occur, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> would relearn that position as a digital limit. Thus, it is possible that the internal, digital position may lose registration with the actual, physical position of the covering because there is no on-going mechanism to register the digital position to the physical one. If a user notes that the digital limit does not correspond with, or is not registered with, the physical limits, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> permits the user to override the digital limits. In particular, if the rocker switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> on the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> for the desired direction of movement is held down for approximately 1.5 seconds, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will attempt to move the covering even though it &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; the covering is at a physical limit. Thereafter, once the covering stops at the true physical limit, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> relearns the new limit as its digital limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> does not know how much the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be tilted clockwise or counter-clockwise. It does know, however, when the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are tilted clockwise or counter-clockwise from the fully-open position (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56D</cross-reference>) by reading the signal from the angular position sensor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> comprising part of the flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, as described above. While the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is tilting the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the moment the flange-operated switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> changes state, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> knows that the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in their fully-open configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the large drive motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is not activated to extend or retract the covering horizontally before the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are oriented in their fully-open configuration, the main operating program instructs the logic system to conduct various checks to determine whether the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are oriented for extension or retraction. During this process, the logic system executing the main operating program can be represented schematically as a state machine that is in one of the nine states shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>, after power-up (i.e., after the power source is connected), the logic system enters the Initialize State represented by block <highlight><bold>5910</bold></highlight>. During this time, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> initializes itself, the processor hardware, and the operator hardware. The logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> never enters this Initialize State again, except if the power source is disconnected and then reconnected. After being initialized, the logic system alternates between the Stopped State represented by block <highlight><bold>5912</bold></highlight>, where it checks whether there is a command from the IR remote <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, and the Sleep State represented by block <highlight><bold>5914</bold></highlight>, which conserves energy. The Sleep State lasts for 288 milliseconds in the preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> If a user were to send a tilt command (action <highlight><bold>5920</bold></highlight>) while the program is in the Stopped State, the Main Program would go into the Tilt CW State represented by block <highlight><bold>5916</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference> or the Tilt CCW State represented by block <highlight><bold>5918</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>. The vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would then be tilted or rotated until either the command to tilt discontinues <highlight><bold>5922</bold></highlight> (i.e., the user stops transmitting a tilt IR signal) or the clockwise or counter-clockwise tilt limit is reached. In the preferred embodiment, the logic system also returns to the Stopped State <highlight><bold>5912</bold></highlight> after the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have moved for four seconds. Subsequently, the Main Program returns to cycling between the Stopped State <highlight><bold>5912</bold></highlight> and the Sleep State <highlight><bold>5914</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Continuing to look at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>, if the user sends a traverse command (action <highlight><bold>5924</bold></highlight>), the main operating program causes the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to first check whether the vanes are fully open, which it remembers from the last time it tilted the vanes. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>, the blind will not move leftwardly, for example, unless (i) the traverse command is &ldquo;left,&rdquo; (ii) the covering is not at a left digital limit or the user presses the remote button for 1.5 seconds, and (iii) the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are centered (i.e., fully open). If all of these conditions are met (received valid move command; covering not a digital limit or the user presses the direction button on the remote for at least 1.5 second; and the vanes are centered), the logic system goes into the Move Left State represented by block <highlight><bold>5926</bold></highlight> or the Move Right State represented by block <highlight><bold>5928</bold></highlight> (if the traverse command is &ldquo;right&rdquo;) to traverse the blind in the desired direction. The logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> stops the traverse operation <highlight><bold>5924</bold></highlight> when the user either releases the button or when the covering reaches a digital limit position stored in memory (i.e., the digital limit <highlight><bold>5930</bold></highlight>). The logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will start moving the covering in the desired direction only if the logic system does not think that the covering is already at the digital limit for that direction. Even if the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> thinks that the covering is at the digital limit, however, if the user keeps pressing the remote button, after about 1.5 seconds, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> erases the digital limit and traverses the blind as requested, until the user releases the button, or the blind is physically stopped <highlight><bold>5930</bold></highlight>. If the blind is physically stopped, the logic system sets that position as the new digital limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> If the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are not fully open when a user attempts to initiate a traverse operation <highlight><bold>5924</bold></highlight>, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> first tilts the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> until they are fully open by entering the Center CW State represented by block <highlight><bold>5932</bold></highlight> or the Center CCW State Block <highlight><bold>5934</bold></highlight>. The logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> determines which way to tilt the blinds according to which orientation the vertical vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in at the beginning of the requested traverse operation. After centering the vertical vanes, the program then proceeds to the Move Left State <highlight><bold>5926</bold></highlight> or the Move Right State <highlight><bold>5928</bold></highlight>, to transverse the covering in the desired direction. In the preferred embodiment, once the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> starts tilting the vanes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> toward the fully-open configuration, even if the user releases the traverse button, the operator continues tilting the vanes until they are fully open. Then, the Main Program returns to cycling between the Stopped State, represented by block <highlight><bold>5912</bold></highlight>, and the Sleep State, represented by block <highlight><bold>5914</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60, 60A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>C, a flowchart of the main operating program is described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference> is a simplified flowchart representation of the overall process carried out by the logic system under the direction of the main operating program, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>C provide a more detailed flowchart representation. At block <highlight><bold>6010</bold></highlight>, the logic system is initialized. The initialization step typically occurs only once unless the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> loses power and loses all of its settings. As shown in block <highlight><bold>6010</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>A, the process of initialization includes the following steps: (i) loading the main operating program into the microprocessor registries during logic system setup; (ii) clearing any random access memory (RAM registers are used to store positioning data); (iii) braking the motors; and (iv) setting the motors position at midpoint (even though the logic system does not know the actual position of the vanes translationally or angularly at this time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> At blocks <highlight><bold>6020</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6020</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A respectively, the logic system wakes up, adjusts and activates various components, stores certain parameters concerning the positioning of the vanes in RAM (if available). Next, the logic system looks for a signal from the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> for a time period of 4 milliseconds as shown at block <highlight><bold>6022</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference>. If a signal is received, the logic system, through a Decoder Machine, attempts to retrieve a command from the IR receiver as shown in blocks <highlight><bold>6030</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6030</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60 and 60</cross-reference>A, respectively. Operation of the decoder machine is discussed in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> If no command is received in the prescribed time the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> does the following: (i) shuts down the various components including the motors; and (ii) sets an alarm at block <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A for 288 milliseconds as shown in Blocks <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A. Next, as shown in blocks <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>A, the logic system goes into the sleep state for the period of the alarm to be reawaken at the expiration of the alarm to repeat the flowchart cycle at block <highlight><bold>6020</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6020</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, a command is received from the Decoder Machine, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will proceed to either the tilt operation (block <highlight><bold>6050</bold></highlight>) or the center and traverse operation (block <highlight><bold>6060</bold></highlight>), depending upon what command was received. A detailed flowchart for the tilt operation is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60B and a</cross-reference> detailed flow chart for the traverse operation is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60C</cross-reference>. After performing the requested tilt or traverse operation, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> again shuts down various components and sets an alarm at block <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>. Following the stop operations represented by block <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> goes to sleep at block <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>. After the alarm time passes, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> returns to block <highlight><bold>6020</bold></highlight>, wakes up, and repeats the cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>B, the logic system first determines whether the tilt command is to tilt the vanes clockwise or counterclockwise, and the logic systems prepares to drive the small motor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the appropriate direction in blocks <highlight><bold>6051</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6051</bold></highlight>B. At block <highlight><bold>6052</bold></highlight>, a flag is set that the vanes are not fully open, a 350 millisecond time-out timer is started concerning the continued IR reception of the appropriate command, and a jog counter is incremented to 41 and an associated jog time is set at 50 milliseconds. At block <highlight><bold>6053</bold></highlight>, the tilt motor is activated and run in the proper direction. As shown in block <highlight><bold>6054</bold></highlight>, commands are read from the remote by a Decoder Machine (described in detail below) as the motor is running. After the motor has run 3.2 milliseconds, the status of the running flag is checked in decision block <highlight><bold>6055</bold></highlight>. If the Running Flag is still set the jog timer is decremented in block <highlight><bold>6056</bold></highlight>A. If the Running Flag is cleared, the jog time is decremented in block <highlight><bold>6056</bold></highlight>B. As long as the timer has not reached 50 milliseconds, the motor continues to run as indicated. Once the jog timer reaches 50 millisecond, the running flag is cleared and the motor is momentarily stopped, the jog counter is decremented, and a new 50 millisecond jog timer is started as illustrated in blocks <highlight><bold>6057</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>6057</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>6058</bold></highlight>, respectively. It can be appreciated that, based on this algorithm, the tilt motor does not move continuously, rather, it cycles off and on, running for no more than 50 milliseconds at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Given the known speed of the tilt motor, the time to move the tilt motor from one closed position to another is less than approximately 4 seconds. If the motor is taking longer to move the vanes from the one angular position to another, there is likely undue strain or load on the associated angular drive system mechanisms. Accordingly, once the jog counter has been decremented 41 times (equivalent to just over 4 seconds motor run time), the motor is braked and the system is put into sleep mode indicated by blocks <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>B, block <highlight><bold>6054</bold></highlight>, if no appropriate command is read from the remote in 350 milliseconds from the start of the IR time-out timer, the tilt motor is stopped in block <highlight><bold>6059</bold></highlight> and the motor is braked and the system is put into sleep mode indicated by blocks <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference>. If a good command is received in block <highlight><bold>6054</bold></highlight>, the IR time-out timer is reset for another 350 millisecond period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>C, the logic system saves the direction command indicating the direction in which the vanes are to be traversed and enables the IR receiver for 350 milliseconds. Next, in decision block <highlight><bold>6062</bold></highlight>, the logic system determines whether the vanes are fully open so that traversing may begin by accessing and reading the appropriate register in RAM. If the vanes are not centered, the logic system centers the vanes as indicated in blocks <highlight><bold>6063</bold></highlight>A-D. The logic system then determines which direction the vanes are to be moved in block <highlight><bold>6064</bold></highlight> and determines whether the vanes are at either their left or right digital limits in blocks <highlight><bold>6065</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6065</bold></highlight>A&prime;. If they are at one of their limits, the logic system determines whether it has continued to receive the traverse command for 1.5 seconds to override the digital limit as indicated in blocks <highlight><bold>6065</bold></highlight>B-C and <highlight><bold>6065</bold></highlight>B&prime;-C&prime;. If the command has not been received for the necessary override period, the logic system proceeds to block <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference>. If the vanes are not at a digital limit, the logic system proceeds to block <highlight><bold>6066</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6066</bold></highlight>&prime; and prepares to proceed with traversing the vanes and begins traversal by starting the large motor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in block <highlight><bold>6066</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>6066</bold></highlight>A, the &ldquo;at limit&rdquo; flags are cleared, the translation sensor is enabled (opto encoder), the IR receiver is activated, and a 600 millisecond encoder flag is set. At block <highlight><bold>6067</bold></highlight>, a 360 millisecond timer is set and the Decoder Machine is called to read commands from the remote control. If no appropriate commands are received in the 360 millisecond period directing the logic system to continue its traversing operation, the motor is stopped and braked, and the logic system proceeds to block <highlight><bold>6055</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>A, where it remains until the user stops pressing the rocker switch on the remote. Once the user has stopped pressing the switch, the program proceeds to the sleep mode as indicated in blocks <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>A. If a new code is received during the 360 millisecond period, the traversal operation continues to proceed as indicated by blocks <highlight><bold>6068</bold></highlight>A-P. It is to be appreciated that the process by which the Decoder Machine is looking for a &ldquo;good command&rdquo; occurs simultaneously with the operation of the main operating program as is explained in greater detail below. Accordingly, while the Decoder Machine is looking for a message during the 360 millisecond period, the logic system is causing the vanes to traverse the headrail as indicated by the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Referring to blocks <highlight><bold>6068</bold></highlight>A-P, the direction that the vanes are to move is determined, the position of the vanes as determined by the position of the motor relative to the left and right digital limits is determined, and, provided the vanes are not registered as being at one of the digital limits, the motor is started and the vanes are moved translationally. If a left or right limit is reached during the movement of the vanes that causes the motor to stall before the motor reaches one of the current digital limits, the logic system sets the current position as the new digital limit for the associated direction of travel. Once the digital limit for extension or retraction has been reached, the motor is stopped and braked and the logic system advances to block <highlight><bold>6040</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight>A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60A</cross-reference> wherein the logic system enters the sleep mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60 and 60</cross-reference>A, the flowcharts depict the process of decoding a command from the remote control as a single block operation. This process is, however, rather involved and is executed by a Decoder Machine described in more detail below in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference> depicts the format of messages delivered from the IR remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The IR remote control sends messages and commands to the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. These messages and commands consist of pulses of IR light. It is to be appreciated, as described above, other types of remote control systems and receiving sensors may be utilized in alternative embodiments of the invention. The time base of the message is a 550 microseconds clock, nominal. Tolerances are due to the clock in the remote control <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and to the remote control clock that runs the microprocessor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> in the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Each pulse or each pause between the pulses lasts either two or five of the 550 microseconds time base periods. A &ldquo;short&rdquo; pulse or a &ldquo;short&rdquo; pause between pulses lasts, therefore, 1.1 milliseconds; and a &ldquo;long&rdquo; pulse or a &ldquo;long&rdquo; pause lasts 2.75 milliseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Each message or command contains three bits: a Start Bit <highlight><bold>6110</bold></highlight>, a Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight>, and a Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight>. This is clearly visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>, which shows each of the four possible IR messages, given the four permutations of the Channel <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> and Direction Bits <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight>. The Start Bit <highlight><bold>6110</bold></highlight> is used to synchronize the command or message. The Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> contains the code for the selected channel (tilt or traverse). The Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight> contains the code for direction. When the tilt channel is selected in the Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight>, the Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight> indicates CW or CCW. When the transverse channel is selected in the Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight>, the Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight> indicates right or left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>, the Start Bit <highlight><bold>6110</bold></highlight> consists of a long pause followed by a long pulse independent of value of the Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> and Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight>. The Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> is coded in either of the following two ways: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Channel 0 (tilt command): short pause, short pulse, short pause, long pulse; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Channel 1 (traverse command): short pause, long pulse, short pause, short pause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight> is coded in either of the following two ways: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Direction 0 (clockwise if tilting or right if traversing): short pause, short pause, short pause, long pulse; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Direction 1 (counter-clockwise if tilting or left if traversing): short pause, long pulse, short pause, short pause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Note that the Channel Bit and the Direction Bit, whether a &ldquo;0&rdquo; bit or a &ldquo;1&rdquo; bit, each lasts the same total time (6 milliseconds). The total length of the message or command, including the Start Bit <highlight><bold>6110</bold></highlight>, Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight>, and Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight>, is 17.4 milliseconds, nominal. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>, the numbers noted along the waveforms are Decoder Machine States. As described further below, the Decoder Machine decodes the messages and commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference> provides the timing for the Decoder Machine. When ready for a command from the IR remote control, the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> calls the routine that executes one run through the Decoder Machine. Each run through the Decoder Machine comprises 368 steps as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference>. During a single step, the decoder determines whether the IR receiver <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is receiving an IR pulse and updates the appropriate state counter, and, if applicable, changes the state of the Decoder Machine. Each step requires 160 microseconds, for a total of 59 milliseconds each time the Decoder Machine is activated. After each step, the Decoder Machine momentarily returns control to the main operating program. This allows the logic system running the main operating program to operate normally, while the decoder machine &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo; decodes a message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The Decoder Machine synchronizes itself with this 160 microseconds time base by looking at a free-running timer, Timer 0, until it underflows. Then, it restarts Timer 0 so that it will underflow again in 160 microseconds. Once it restarts Timer 0, the Decoder Machine then runs a single step and returns control to the main operating program. Within that time, the main operating program running on the logic system executes whatever it needs to do, and calls the Decoder Machine again. The Decoder Machine then catches the next 160 microsecond tick. With the 160 microsecond time base, the Decoder Machine samples the IR signal from the remote control about seven times per 1.1 millisecond period and about sixteen times per 2.7 millisecond period. Based on the number of successive steps in which a pulse is encountered and/or the number of pulses in which a &ldquo;pause&rdquo; is encountered in combination, the Decoder Machine can advance its state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Even if the Decoder Machine decodes a good message before it has completed all 368 steps, it still keeps running until all 368 steps have been completed. After the Decoder Machine has run 368 steps, it declares that it is done, independent of whether it has been able to decode a good message. Therefore, the Decoder Machine typically runs for 59 milliseconds each time it runs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The Decoder Machine algorithm is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference>. After the algorithm starts, block <highlight><bold>6310</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine attempts to sync to the message. It does this by looking for a sync pulse <highlight><bold>6108</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>) in block <highlight><bold>6312</bold></highlight>. When it sees a pulse (which may or may not be the sync pulse <highlight><bold>6108</bold></highlight>), the Decoder Machine looks at the trailing edge of the pulse. From there, control moves to block <highlight><bold>6314</bold></highlight> where the Decoder Machine looks for the Start Bit. If the Decoder Machine cannot sync (e.g., because of a bad transmission or noise from other IR sources), the Decoder Machine goes back along the &ldquo;not found&rdquo; path and tries to catch the next message. If at block <highlight><bold>6314</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine finds the start bit <highlight><bold>6110</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>), which, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>6314</bold></highlight>, consists of a long pause followed by a long pulse, and is thus able to sync, it then measures the duration of the next pulse, which is the first pulse of the Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>), at block <highlight><bold>6316</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that durations of the pulses or pauses are measured in terms of the number of consecutive 160 microsecond steps in which the Decoding Machine measures a high condition (a pulse) or a low condition (a pause). If it is determined at block <highlight><bold>6317</bold></highlight> that the pulse is &ldquo;short&rdquo; (1.1 milliseconds), the Decoder Machine sets the channel to &ldquo;0&rdquo; in block <highlight><bold>6318</bold></highlight>. This indicates that the user wants to tilt the vanes. If, on the other hand, it is determined at block <highlight><bold>6317</bold></highlight> that the pulse measured at block <highlight><bold>6316</bold></highlight> is greater than 1.6 milliseconds (i.e., a &ldquo;long&rdquo; (2.7 millisecond) pulse), the Decoder Machine sets the channel to &ldquo;1&rdquo; in block <highlight><bold>6320</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>6322</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine verifies that it has set the channel correctly. If channel &ldquo;0&rdquo; is correct, the Decoder Machine confirms that by recognizing a 1.1 millisecond pulse completing the Channel Bit <highlight><bold>6112</bold></highlight> (FIG. <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). If channel &ldquo;1&rdquo; is correct, the Decoder Machine confirms that by recognizing a 1.1 millisecond pause, followed by a 1.1 millisecond pulse. If the Decoder Machine is unable to confirm the channel selection, control transfers along the &ldquo;not found&rdquo; branch, and the Decoder Machine starts over looking for the next message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the channel selection is confirmed, control transfers to block <highlight><bold>6326</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>6326</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine measures the duration of the next pulse, which should be part of the Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight>. Next, in block <highlight><bold>6327</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine determines based upon the duration of the first pulse which command was sent. If the duration is less than 1.6 milliseconds, the direction is set to right traverse or clockwise tilt in block <highlight><bold>6329</bold></highlight>. If, on the other hand, the duration is greater than 1.6 milliseconds, the direction is set to left traverse or counter-clockwise tilt in block <highlight><bold>6330</bold></highlight>. In block <highlight><bold>6332</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine verifies that it has set the direction correctly. If direction &ldquo;right or CW&rdquo; is correct, the Decoder Machine confirms that by recognizing a 1.1 millisecond pause followed by a 2.7 millisecond pulse completing the Direction Bit <highlight><bold>6114</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>). If direction &ldquo;left or CCW&rdquo; is correct, the Decoder Machine confirms that by recognizing a 1.1 millisecond pause, followed by a 1.1 milliseconds pulse. If the Decoder Machine is unable to confirm the direction setting, control transfers along the &ldquo;not found&rdquo; branch at action <highlight><bold>6334</bold></highlight>, and the Decoder Machine starts over looking for the next message. Assuming that the direction setting is confirmed, control transfers to block <highlight><bold>6336</bold></highlight>, where a &ldquo;good command&rdquo; is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference> depicts the states of the Decoder Machine. The Decoder Machine can be in one of twenty-seven States (<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). In States <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6410</bold></highlight>), the Decoder Machine resets the IR receiver <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. In States <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6412</bold></highlight>), the Decoder Machine synchronizes itself to the message by skipping a pulse and starting its time base at the trailing edge of that pulse. In States <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6414</bold></highlight>), the Decoder Machine detects the Start Bit. In States <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6416</bold></highlight>), the Decoder Machine detects the Channel Bit. It should be noted that State <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> only occurs if the channel is &ldquo;traverse.&rdquo; The Decoder Machine decides if the channel is &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; or &ldquo;traverse&rdquo; based upon the duration of State <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (i.e., whether at the trailing edge of State <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the pulse remains on (channel 1: traverse) or switches off (channel 0: tilt)). States <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6418</bold></highlight>) detect the Direction Bit. It should be noted that State <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> only occurs if the direction is &ldquo;left&rdquo; or &ldquo;counter-clockwise.&rdquo; The Decoder Machine decides if the command is &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;left&rdquo; based upon the duration of State <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., whether, at the trailing edge of State <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the pulse remains on (direction left or counter-clockwise) or switches off (direction right or clockwise)). When the message is over, the Decoder Machine is in State <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Each State comprising part of one of the three bits (Start Bit&equals;States <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; Channel Bit&equals;States <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; and Direction Bit&equals;States <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in a command or message has two exit points, based upon the time in the State (in milliseconds) and the status of the IR signal (i.e., on or off). Typically, each State flows to the following State. If the input IR signal does not behave as expected, however, the State flows back into States <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to try to catch a new message or command. It should also be noted that State <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> flows into State <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or State <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, depending upon whether the channel selected is &ldquo;traverse&rdquo; or &ldquo;tilt,&rdquo; respectively. Similarly, it should be noted that State <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> flows into either State <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or State <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, depending upon whether the direction is &ldquo;left/counter-clockwise&rdquo; or &ldquo;right/clockwise,&rdquo; respectively. Finally, it should also be noted that State <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is reached when the 368th step is performed independent of whether a good message or command was received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference> is the Decoder Machine state flowchart for decoding a message. This flowchart provides an overview, demonstrating how the program decodes a message in a plurality of steps. The action taken during each step depending on what state the Decoder Machine is in as represented in block <highlight><bold>6510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>, an example of the typical advancement of the Decoder Machine from one state to another will be described. In boxes <highlight><bold>6510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6512</bold></highlight>, the 160 microsecond timer is synchronized to the Decoder Machine. Also in box <highlight><bold>6512</bold></highlight>, the step counter is decremented. For sake of this example, assume the step counter is lowered from step 242 to 241 (meaning 117 steps have already been completed and 241 steps including the current one remain to be completed). Since the Decoder Machine is processing step 241, which is greater than zero, the state timer is decremented in block <highlight><bold>6516</bold></highlight>. If the step was &minus;1 in block <highlight><bold>6514</bold></highlight>, the Decoder Machine would move into state <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in block <highlight><bold>6518</bold></highlight> and exit the Decoder Machine routine. In other words, the logic system would exit the get command block <highlight><bold>6030</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference> and proceed to the stop block <highlight><bold>6070</bold></highlight> as directed by the main operating program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Referring back to block <highlight><bold>6516</bold></highlight>, the IR signal is sampled. For this example we will assume that the Decoder Machine is in State <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an IR signal is registered and that it is the 10th consecutive signal recorded decrementing the state timer to zero. Next, the decoder Machine advances through block <highlight><bold>6520</bold></highlight> to the State <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> row in column <highlight><bold>6510</bold></highlight>. Referring to the State <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> box in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference>, the Decoder Machine advances to State <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> if there has been a 160 millisecond pulse. Since each step has a time base of 160 microsecond and the state timer has registered an IR signal in 10 consecutive steps (10&times;160 microsecond&equals;1.6 milliseconds), the Decoder Machine is advanced to the State <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through box <highlight><bold>6522</bold></highlight>. At box <highlight><bold>6524</bold></highlight>, the 241st step has been completed and the control is momentarily returned to the main operating program of the logic system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> until the process is repeated for step 240. The Decoder Machine will continue to advance its state until (i) a completed message is received, (ii) the failure to satisfy a state advancement condition as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference> causes the Decoder Machine to return to either State <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or (iii) the step counter is decremented to &lt;0. </paragraph>
