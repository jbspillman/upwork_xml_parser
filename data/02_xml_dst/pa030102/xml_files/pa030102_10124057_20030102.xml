<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for chemical vapor deposition at ambient temperature using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and a method for depositing metal composite film using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, there are conventional methods such as an ion beam deposition, a sputter deposition, and a thermal evaporation for forming metal film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the ion beam deposition method, a metal is vaporized in a tungsten filament crucible furnace. The metal vapor spouted outward by thermoionic impact forms molecular form or a cluster, and then ionized in an electromagnetic field. The ions are accelerated by an particle accelerator to be impacted on a substrate, and thereby a film is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A film formation mechanism comprises a cluster formation, a nucleation process, and an ad-atom migration. The ion energy in the ion beam ranges largely as eV&tilde;MeV. In addition, the ion energy can be divided into a high energy (MeV), a narrow energy (hundreds of keV&tilde;tens of keV), and a broad beam (hundreds of eV&tilde;a few eV) according to the energy range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The high energy and the narrow beam having high ion energy are generally used for forming a buried layer of an inorganic film, surface modification, ion injection, or for physical deposition. However, these have high ion energy, and therefore, circumferential temperature rises when the ions are impacted to the substrate to generate many defects, and roughness of an interface and a surface are increased greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The broad beam is usually used for the physical deposition, and the physical vapor deposition can be divided into an ion vapor deposition (IVD), and an ion cluster beam (ICB) according to an ion assisted deposition (IAD) method. The IVD deposits the metal physically as activating the substrate using vapor atom, and the ICB makes the material, which will be deposited, an atom or an ion cluster, and deposits directly by adding energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The physical vapor deposition by the ion beam can perform the deposition rapidly and can perform a metal composite film if a plurality of furnaces are used. However, it has some disadvantages as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 1) It is difficult to control an amount and a composition of metal included in the film according to a pressure condition in a reactor because the metal is vaporized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 2) Fusion points are different from the kind of the metal, the vaporization speed is differentiated by the temperature in the furnace, and therefore, the metal source which can be used is limited. Also, it is difficult to apply in a successive processes due to the limited size of the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 3) Even in case of the broad beam having lower energy, it is difficult to enlarge due to the problems caused by the focusing of the metal ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 4) The circumferential temperature is risen by the impact between the accelerated ion of high energy and the substrate to generate many defects, and thereby an interfacial adhesion force is weak and the film is degraded as the time goes by. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 5) in case that the substrate is an organic material such as a polymer, the material may be distorted or the physical property of the material may be changed during the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a physical vapor deposition method by a sputter is a technique which etches a metal target using microwave, RF plasma, and DC discharge and physically deposits the ionized metal target on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The above technique can deposit simply and rapidly, however, the interface damage is increased and defects are formed on the film, and thereby a mechanical strength or adhesion force between the interfaces is lowered. In addition, the bounding energy is greatly lowered on an upper part of the film because the composition of the film is constituted only of the adhesion of the metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A principle of the thermal evaporation is simple, that is, the metal, the compound, or the alloy is heated in a vacuum state to be evaporated from the fusion state, and the evaporated particles are deposited on the substrate. The above method is different from the sputtering method in a point that the evaporation process is the heat exchanging process. The thin film made by the above method is called as vacuum thermal evaporation thin film. Advantages of the vacuum deposition method are as follows. First, a structure of device is relatively simple, second, the vacuum deposition method can be applied to many materials, third, a core growth or thin film growth theory can be easily applied to form the thin film because the thin film formation mechanism is relatively simple, and fourth, it is suitable for in-situ observation of the thin film in forming the thin film because the above method is thermally and electrically simple. Also, fifth, a material having different crystal structure from that of the material of thermodynamical equilibrium or a compound having different composition can be made. However, the above method can be used usually for depositing the material having lower fusion point, there is a limit in the material for evaporation considering the vapor pressure, and the adhesion force of the thin film which is made similarly to the sputtered film is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to maximize the advantages of the vacuum deposition, devices in which the ion beam method and the sputtering method is combined are developed (U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,183). In above device, the ion beam is radiated to a magnetron target to generate a large amount of sputtered particles and secondary ions. However, according to the above device, the ion beam is used only for increasing the function of the sputter, and the fundamental characteristic of the thin film can not be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the conventional deposition methods, the characteristic of the deposited film is inferior, and especially, it is not convenient for changing the characteristic of the film. Also, there are some problems such that the deposition is made in high temperature, or the substrate is damaged physically. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The organo-metallic compounds are decomposed into the positive and negative ions in the ECR area. That is, the metal ions become mainly the positive ions representing electric charge, and the hydrocarbon radicals are decomposed and changed into the negative ions. When a cycle current representing the negative charge is provided from the inducing system to the grid which is installed around the substrate, the density of the metal positive ions is rapidly increased around the substrate. The grid is installed around the process chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and uses a mesh constituting the metal such as stainless steel. The wave type of negative potential connected to the grid can be applied by negative DC high voltage or the cycle half-wave type negative potential (pulse voltage), and ranges &minus;0.1&tilde;2.0 kV according to the present invention. In case that the amount of metal positive ions which are increased rapidly around the substrate are larger than the amount of vapor, the metal film is deposited on the surface of the substrate by a heterogeneous reaction which is more stable in energy than the vapor phase homogeneous reaction. The hydrocarbon negative ions decomposed and generated by the ECR plasma generate a plasma polymerization by reacting with free radicals formed on the surface of the substrate. And finally, a film in which the metal and the carbonized film are compounded is formed on the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the negative potential applied to the grid is changed to control the positive ion density and the negative ion density around the substrate, and consequently, the conductivity of the composite film can be controlled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARING EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As comparing the copper thin film fabricated by the present invention to the surface of the thin film fabricated by the sputter, copper metallic crystal can be hardly shown on the surface fabricated by the ECR/sputter compounded type chemical deposition at ambient temperature as an amorphous form, however, the thin film fabricated using the sputter is covered with the copper metallic crystals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARING EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As comparing the cross section of copper thin film deposited on the polymer resin according to the present invention to that of the thin film deposited by the sputter, the cross section of the present invention is coupled to the polymer resin firmly and the boundary of the copper and the polymer resin is uncertain. However, the bounding force of the cross section of the thin film fabricated by the sputtering method is gradually weakened as going upward, and the boundary between the cross section of the polymer resin and the copper thin film is shown vividly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARING EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The composition of the metal composite film which is chemically deposited on the polymer resin is analyzed by Auger in order to compare. As the result of the analyzing, the composition of the thin film according to the present invention comprises Cu 74%, C 25%, and O 1%, and the resistance of the thin film is 69.6 &OHgr;/cm. However, the thin film fabricated by the sputter comprises Cu 100% as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the result supports the result of comparing example 2. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARING EXAMPLE 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is showing a result that the composition of the metal composite film deposited on the polymer resin by locating the nickel on the plasma etching zone and providing paraxylene organic material independently, and composition of the film comprises Cu 3.5%, C 25%, F 3%, and O 2.5% included in the precursor, and Zn 2%, and Ni 63% which are sputtered from an electrode material. And the resistance of the thin film is 69.6 &OHgr;/cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, a multicomponent metal thin film can be deposited on the polymer surface at ambient temperature using ECR plasma chemical deposition method, and detailed effects of the present invention will be described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 1. The metal thin film formed by the chemical deposition of the present invention has superior film characteristic that the adhesion between the substrate and the metal thin film is very firm when it is compared to the metal thin film fabricated using the sputter or the ion beam of the conventional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> 2. The ionizing energy is high due to the ECR condition, and therefore the plasma of high density is formed. In addition, the chemical deposition speed can be increased by coupling with the sputter which is the device for supplying the ionized metal. Also, if a plurality of sputter guns are installed in the chamber, formation of the multicomponent metal thin film and the composition controlling can be performed easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 3. The deposition area and the plasma zone are not divided with each other, and the film growth mechanism is the chemical reaction which is different from that of the conventional art, that is, the impacts of the metal particles, and thereby the change of the physical property such as the distortion of the substrate or the mechanical strength lowering is not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> 4. The conductivity of the deposited metal film can be controlled by controlling plasma power, composition and kinds of the metal included in the film, and the density of the organic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 5. The multicomponent metal film which is constructed chemically can be deposited, and therefore, the metal thin film of new function and of high performance requiring a special function can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 6. According to the method for fabricating the metal thin film on the surface of the polymer resin by the chemical deposition using ECR of the present invention, the plasma is generated out of the chamber and injected into the chamber, and therefore, it is convenient for enlarging the substrate which is the object of coating and constructing successive processes. Thereby, it can be easily applied to a mass product equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
