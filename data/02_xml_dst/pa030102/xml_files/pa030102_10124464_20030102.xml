<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention includes a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) communication system having a base station and at least one mobile station, each transmitting and receiving an analog radio-frequency signal carrying digitally coded speech. The speech is encoded using a vocoder which samples a voice signal at variable encoding rates. During periods when the radio-frequency channel is experiencing high levels of channel interference, the encoded voice channel having a lower encoding rate is chosen. This low-rate encoded voice is combined with the high degree of channel coding necessary to ensure reliable transmission. When the radio-frequency channel is experiencing low levels of channel interference, less channel coding is necessary and the vocoder having a higher encoding rate is used. The high-rate encoded voice is combined with the lower degree of channel coding necessary to ensure reliable transmission. The appropriate levels of channel coding necessary for reliable transmission are determined by various channel metrics, such as frame erase rate and bit error rate. The determination of the appropriate vocoder rate and level of channel coding for both the uplink and downlink may be determined centrally at the base station, with the vocoder rate and level of channel coding for the uplink being relayed to the mobile station.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wireless communication system having an adaptive multi-rate (AMR) vocoder to maximize the voice quality while minimizing the level of channel coding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the use of wireless communication systems become increasingly popular, a variety of methods are being developed to increase the number of mobile communication devices a system can simultaneously service. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), also referred to as the Group Speciale Mobile, is one example of a wireless communication system which is constantly being adapted to increase the number of simultaneous users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The GSM system is modeled after standards created by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and operates between a telecommunication base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) using a pair of frequency bands in a frequency division duplex (FDD) configuration. The first frequency band occupies the frequency spectrum between 890 to 915 Megahertz (MHZ), and the second frequency band occupies the frequency spectrum between 935 to 960 MHZ. Typically, the first frequency range is used for the lower power transmissions from the MS to the BS, and the second frequency range is used for the higher power transmission from the BS to the MS. Each frequency range is divided into 125 channels with 200 Kilohertz (kHz) spaced carrier frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The GSM communication system is a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) system. In the GSM TDMA system, each carrier frequency is divided into eight (8) time slots. Because each MS is assigned a single time slot on one channel in both the first frequency range and the second frequency range, a total of 992 MS may use the BS at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A typical speech channel for GSM communication is sampled at 8 KHz and quantized to a resolution of 13 bits, providing for the digitization of speech ranging from 0-4 KHz by a voice encoder, also referred to as a vocoder. The 13 bits are then compressed by a factor of eight (8) in a full-rate vocoder to a voice data digital bit stream of 13 kilobits per second (Kbit/s). Because GSM uses a complex encryption technique with interleaving and convolution coding, a high degree of system integrity and bit error control are achieved. In fact, despite multi-path and co-channel interference, the GSM system may continue to operate despite a carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) as low as 9 dB, in comparison to a typical advanced mobile phone service (AMPS) analog system requiring a maximum C/I of 17 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the topography of an area, a typical BS may provide communication services to any number of MSs within a radius up to 35 Kilometers. Consequently, with the rising popularity of mobile communication devices, it is often the case that during peak periods of use, such as rush-hour traffic, all channels are fully occupied and the BS is not able to provide communication services all of the MS in its region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid the inability to service all MS within a region, the ETSI has contemplated a modification of the GSM standard to increase the density of the 9 communication channels. However, because the allocated frequency spectrum of 25 MHZ with 125 separate 200 KHz carrier channels is fixed, a current approach to increasing the density of the communication system is to increase the number of users per channel. In general, this density increase is achieved by decreasing the amount of digital information which is sent to and from each BS, thereby allowing each BS to support more users in a 200 kHz frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One approach to decreasing the amount of digital information passing between a BS and a MS is to decrease the vocoder rate of the digital voice data from a full-rate vocoder rate of 13 kilobits per second (Kbits/s) to a half-rate vocoder rate of 5.6 Kbits/s. Although the ability currently exists to effectively double the number of users on any one communication channel from eight (8) to sixteen (16) by using the half-rate vocoder, it has been found that the 5.6 Kbits/s vocoder rate is barely acceptable as the speech quality is significantly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In light of the above, it would be advantageous to provide a communication system that provides for the user density of a half-rate vocoder system, while providing the voice quality approaching or exceeding that of a full-rate vocoder system. It would also be advantageous to provide a communication system that provides for the modification of the communication channel to incorporate only the amount of channel coding necessary to achieve a reliable communication link between the MS and the BS. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Broadly, the present invention provides for a wireless communication system having the ability to increase or decrease the vocoder rate and channel coding in response to the level of interference present on the wireless communication channel, resulting in a communication channel having the best possible speech quality. This may be accomplished in either a full-rate or half-rate GSM communication system by decreasing the amount of channel coding during periods of low channel interference to allow transmission of more speech information, representing a higher vocoder rate and resulting in a higher speech quality. During periods of higher channel interference, the amount of channel coding may be increased to the maximum channel coding allowed in a GSM communication network. This increased channel coding provides for consistent and reliable call handling, and results in a lower vocoder rate having a lower speech quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) communication system includes a base station (BS) and at least one mobile station (MS), each transmitting and receiving an analog radio-frequency signal carrying digitally coded speech. The speech is digitally encoded using a vocoder which samples a voice signal at different encoding rates. Alternatively, the speech may be encoded using a number of different vocoders simultaneously, with each vocoder having a different encoding rate. During periods when the radio-frequency channel is experiencing high levels of channel noise or interference, the encoded voice channel having a lower encoding rate is chosen. This lower-rate encoded voice is combined with the high degree of channel coding necessary to ensure reliable transmission. When the radio-frequency channel is experiencing low levels of channel interference, less channel coding is necessary and the vocoder having a higher encoding rate is used. The high-rate encoded voice is combined with the lower degree of channel coding necessary to ensure reliable transmission. The appropriate level of channel coding necessary for reliable transmission is determined by various channel metrics, such as frame erase rate and bit error rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The determination of the appropriate vocoder rate and level of channel coding for both the uplink and downlink may be determined centrally at the base station, with the vocoder rate and level of channel coding for the uplink being relayed to the mobile station. Alternatively, the appropriate vocoder rate and level of channel coding for the downlink may be determined by the mobile station, and the appropriate vocoder rate and level of channel coding for the uplink may be determined by the base station.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> System Architecture of a Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary communication system of the present invention is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> operates in compliance with the GSM communication standard which includes a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) communication scheme. In general, a TDMA communication system provides for the transmission of two or more data channels over the same radio-frequency channel by allocating separate time intervals for the transmission of each data channel. In a GSM system, each 200 kilohertz (kHz) radio-frequency channel is divided into repeating time frames, each frame having a duration of 4.615 milliseconds. Each frame contains eight (8) time intervals (also called &ldquo;slots&rdquo;) each having a duration of 577 microseconds (4,615/8) and assigned to a different user. Communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a base station (BS) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which receives signals from a mobile switching center (MSC) <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via communication channel <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. This communication channel includes telephone and/or digital information which may typically originate from land-based telephone systems. Base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> transmits information to, and receives information from, mobile stations (MS) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which are within cell <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Cell <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a geographical region within which all mobile stations communicate with the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Typically, these cells range may have radii ranging from twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (35) kilometers, and may include such geographical disturbances such as buildings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or mountains <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As used herein, the term &ldquo;information&rdquo; shall be defined to include digital data, encrypted digital data, convolutionally coded, softcoded, and/or hard-coded data, digital bits or a bit stream, or any other data type known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because a GSM-based communication system operates with paired frequency bands in a frequency-division-duplex (FDD) mode, base station (BS) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> sends information to the mobile station (MS) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> over a first radio-frequency channel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, typically in the 890 to 915 MHZ range and referred to as the &ldquo;downlink,&rdquo; and mobile station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sends information to the base station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> over a second radio-frequency channel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, typically in the 935 to 960 MHZ range and referred to as the &ldquo;uplink.&rdquo; Although a GSM-based communication system operates using two frequency bands, it is nonetheless possible to implement the present invention in a system where both the BS and MS transmit and receive over the same radio-frequency channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may support a number of mobile stations (MSs) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In fact, under the GSM standard, each 25 MHZ frequency band is divided into 125 channels with 200 Kilohertz (KHz) spaced carrier frequencies. With each carrier frequency supporting eight (8) separate users, a single GSM communication system may support nearly one thousand (1,000) simultaneous users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Given the high possible number of simultaneous users contributing to co-channel interference, and the presence of atmospheric and geographical sources of interference, there are periods of time during which a considerable amount of channel noise and interference is present on the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the presence of buildings <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and mountains <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> result in multi-path distortion which further degrade the reliability of transmissions through the communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Additionally, because each MS may be moving in a different direction with respect to the BS, either towards or away from the BS at speeds up to 250 kilometers-per-hour (156 miles-per-hour), the possibility that a communication link will be temporarily or permanently disrupted is even higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to minimize the deleterious effects of channel noise and interference on both the uplink and downlink communication channels, a significant amount of channel coding is added to the digital voice data. Channel coding is generally defined to include the process of combining the encoded digital voice data from the vocoder, with any redundant data, parity data, cyclic-redundant-checking (CRC) or other check data necessary to ensure the reliable transmission of the voice data. The code rate is the ratio of data bits to total bits (k/n), and is typically just over one-half ({fraction (1/2)}) in an ordinary GSM-based system with full-rate vocoders, and just below one-half ({fraction (1/2)}) in a system with half-rate vocoders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> During the channel coding process, the introduction of the necessary error correction, redundant data, parity data, CRC or check data is accomplished by convolutionally coding the digital voice data from the vocoder, with the necessary channel coding data. This results in a convolutionally encoded digital data stream which includes a mixture of voice data and channel coding. As will be more thoroughly discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this digital data stream is modulated and amplified for transmission over a radio-frequency channel. Upon reception of the modulated digital data stream, the data stream is channel de-modulated and the voice data and channel coding is convolutionally decoded and separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> During periods with high levels of channel noise, the introduction of significant channel coding provides for an increased reliability of the communication channel. On the other hand, a data stream containing a significant amount of channel coding information limits the amount of voice data which can be transmitted, and during periods of low channel noise, results in an inefficient use of the communication channel. Consequently, the present invention monitors the current level of channel noise, and either increases the amount of channel coding to improve channel reliability, or decreases the amount of channel coding to provide for the transmission of more voice data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Although the current GSM-based communication systems dictate a maximum vocoder rate of 13 Kbits/s for a full-rate vocoder system, the present invention contemplates a much higher maximum vocoder rate up to the bandwidth limitation of the wireless communication channel itself. For instance, if the current level of channel noise or interference is minimal, it is possible to provide a communication link having virtually no channel coding and thus providing for a voice data rate of 22 Kbits/s. This would correspond to a voice bandwidth over 4 kHz, resulting in a voice channel having a frequency range and corresponding voice quality well beyond that of a traditional 4 kHz voice bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Transceiver Architecture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> circuit diagram of a transceiver of one embodiment of the present invention is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The transmitter portion of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a microphone element <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, such as an electret-type microphone, that receives an acoustic signal, such as a users voice, and converts the acoustic voice signal to an analog electrical signal. This analog electrical signal passes through amplifier <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for amplification and filtering, and is supplied to the inputs of three (3) separate voice encoders, or vocoders <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A vocoder is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which is created especially for the digital encoding and compression of analog voice data. Vocoders are designed around high speed digital signal processors (DSPs) and use a form of linear predictive coding which is intended to model the human vocal chords in order to produce realistic synthetic speech with the minimum of memory. In a GSM communication system with full-rate vocoders, voice data is sampled at the rate of 8 kHz and quantized to a resolution of thirteen (13) bits and compressed to a bit rate of 13 Kbits/s. In a GSM communication system with half-rate vocoders, voice data is sampled at the rate of 8 kHz and quantized to a resolution of thirteen (13) bits and compressed to give a bit rate of 5.6 Kbits/s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, vocoders <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> each receives the amplified voice signal from amplifier <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and each vocoder is continuously encoding the acoustic voice signals at different rates. For example, vocoder <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may encode the voice signal at a vocoder rate of 8 Kbits/s, vocoder <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may encode the voice signal at a lower vocoder rate of 6 Kbits/s, and vocoder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may encode the voice signal at an even lower vocoder rate of 4 Kbits/s. The particular vocoder rates discussed herein are merely exemplary, and it is to be appreciated that a vocoder of virtually any rate may be used, so long as the representative digital data rate is capable of being transmitted over the radio-frequency communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The outputs from vocoders <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are fed into switch <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> which is controlled by processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> having a memory storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment is a microprocessor. However, processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may instead be any conventional single or multi-chipped microprocessor, digital signal processor, microcontroller, or any other suitable digital processing apparatus known in the art. Memory storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment may include an electrically erasable programmable read-only-memory (EEPROM), read-only-memory (ROM), random-access-memory (RAM), diskettes or other magnetic recording media, optical storage media, or any combination thereof. Electronic instructions for controlling the operation of processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, in the form of program code, may be stored in memory storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Based upon a predefined selection process, described in greater detail below, processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> determines the proper vocoder rate and selects the output of the appropriate vocoder <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for passage through switch <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to encoder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. For example, if the voice signal is to be encoded at a full-rate of 8 Kbits/s, then the output of vocoder <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> would be selected by processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and passed through switch <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if the voice is to be encoded at the rate of 6 Kbits/s, the output of vocoder <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> would be selected. Encoder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> receives the digital voice data from the vocoder and adds the level of channel coding corresponding to the vocoder rate selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once passed through encoder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the now-encoded digital voice data is mixed with the analog output of voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to modulate the digital voice data onto a carrier frequency in modulator <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Modulator <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> modulates a gaussian-minimum-shift-key (GMSK) signal on a radio-frequency carrier which is then passed through variable power amplifier <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and through transmit/receive switch <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to antenna <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> for transmission. A GMSK signal incorporates gaussian-shaped pulses and is intended improve the resilience of the communication channel to co-channel interference. As an alternative to GMSK, other modulation methods known in the art may be used, such as BPSK, QPSK, or FSK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Control of transmit/receive switch <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is accomplished by processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in a method well known in the art. In single antenna transceivers, it is often necessary to switch the antenna between the transmitting and receiving portions of the circuitry in order to isolate the sensitive receiver electronics from the higher power signal generated by the transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The receiver portion of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begins with antenna <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> which receives an analog radio-frequency signal that is passed through transmit/receive switch <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifier and mixer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Mixer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> removes the carrier frequency from the radio-frequency signal and passes the remaining analog signal to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. ADC <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> converts the received analog signal to a digital signal which is then passed through equalization block <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> where the digital signal may be filtered and the digital bit stream recovered, and to channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As will be discussed in more detail below, processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> receives a signal, in the form of rate bits, from channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. These rate bits identify the appropriate vocoder rate needed to decode the current voice data encoded in the received signal. Based upon the rate bits, processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> selects vocoder <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> using switch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, and the digital voice data from the decoded radio-frequency channel is passed from channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, through switch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, and to the appropriate vocoder <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. For example, if the digital voice data was encoded at a full-rate of 8 Kbits/s, then processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> would operate switch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to send the digital voice data to vocoder <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> which, in the present embodiment, decodes at the full-rate of 8 Kbits/s. Vocoder <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> decodes the digital information received from channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, and re-creates the original analog voice signal which is then passed through amplifier <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and out speaker <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> to be heard by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, vocoders <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a single vocoder (shown by dashed lines <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>) having multiple encoding rates, or a variable encoding rate. For instance, the single variable-rate vocoder <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be capable of encoding acoustic signals from amplifier <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> at rates between 4 Kbits/s, and 8 Kbits/s as determined by processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Similarly, vocoders <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a single variable vocoder <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention is discussed in conjunction with a TDMA communication system, it is to be appreciated that the use of a TDMA communication scheme is merely exemplary, and the present invention may be practiced on any number of alternative communications systems, such as code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) and frequency-division-multiple-access (FDMA), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> graphical representation of system performance is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Graph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a vertical axis <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> labeled &ldquo;Voice Quality&rdquo; and a horizontal axis <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> labeled &ldquo;Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (C/N).&rdquo; As discussed herein, the term C/N is considered to include a carrier-to-interference (C/I) portion. In summary, graph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> represents the performance of communication systems based on the level of channel coding and corresponding vocoder rates. More specifically, three separate curves are shown and each represents the performance of a particular system configuration. For example, graph <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> represents the performance of a communication system using a full-rate vocoder, with a minimum level of channel coding. As can been seen, curve <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> begins at a higher initial voice quality, but as the C/N decreases, the level of interference due to the lower level of channel coding eventually causes a marked decrease in the voice quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Similarly, curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> represents the performance of a communication system using a mid-rate vocoder with a corresponding mid-level of channel coding. Such a mid-rate vocoder rate could be 6 Kbits/s. Although the initial voice quality shown by curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is maintained for a longer period, it too suffers from the interference caused by the lower level of channel coding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Finally, curve <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> represents the system performance of a communication system using a low-rate vocoder with a corresponding higher level of channel coding. In this case, the high level of channel coding provides for a continuous communication link despite a significant decrease in the C/N, however, the voice quality is lower than either the system shown by curve <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain the highest level of voice quality possible, despite the decreasing C/N, the present invention changes the voice encoding rate and corresponding level of channel coding in order to maximize the voice quality. For example, in environments where the C/N ratio is high, the system uses the highest possible vocoder rate and lowest possible amount of channel coding. In this situation, because of the low levels of noise and interference on the communication channel, there is little need for heavy channel coding to ensure the communication channel is sustained. However, as the C/N ratio begins to decrease, at the precise instant when curve <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> crosses curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, shown as intersection <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the communication system of the present invention changes the vocoder rate and corresponding channel coding to the rate associated with curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the highest possible level of voice quality is maintained, even though there is a higher level of channel coding present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as the voice quality of the system represented by curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> drops to the level of the system represented by curve <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, shown at intersection <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the communication system of the present invention again changes the vocoder rate and corresponding channel coding to the rate associated with curve <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the voice quality for the communication channel is always maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the event the channel noise and interference exceeds the maximum allowable level and results in the voice quality being sufficiently poor so as to pass below the threshold <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, shown at intersection <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the communication channel is terminated. This terminated communication channel is perceived by the user as a &ldquo;dropped call.&rdquo; Once terminated, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> must be re-initialized and a communication channel must be re-established between the BS <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the MS <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Graph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has been divided into three (3) regions <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, representing the maximized voice quality. A communication channel using the present invention will operate within each of these regions as needed to maximize the voice quality. For example, for a communication channel which is initiated at a vocoder and channel coding rate in region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> corresponding to curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a momentary decrease in the C/N may cause the system to switch to a vocoder and channel coding rate in region <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> corresponding to curve <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. However, once the C/N returns to its original value, the system will shift back to the vocoder and channel coding rate of region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> corresponding to curve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In this manner, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may constantly move between regions <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to maximize the voice quality of the communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Graph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has been shown to include three (3) separate curves representing three (3) different vocoder rates and corresponding levels of channel coding. However, it should be appreciated that the selection of three (3) vocoder rates is merely exemplary, and virtually any number of vocoder rates may be used in the present invention. Moreover, in a system of the present invention incorporating a vocoder having a variable vocoder rate, virtually any combination of vocoder rate and channel coding may be accomplished within the system limits, ranging from a maximum vocoder rate with no channel coding, to minimum vocoder rate with maximum channel coding. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> diagrammatic representation of the construction of a GSM communication channel is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Representation <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a series of three (3) speech blocks <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> includes a channel coding portion <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and a voice data portion <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. A speech block represents the digital information which has been generated by the vocoder <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and channel coder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the digital information within a speech block includes both the voice data and channel coding which has been determined necessary for the reliable transmission of the information. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> identifies a channel coding portion <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and a voice data portion <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as separate portions of speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, it is to be appreciated that such identification is merely for discussion purposes, and the voice data is actually interleaved with the channel coding to create a data stream having 228 bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Speech blocks <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are each shown having different ratios of channel coding portions and voice data portions. More specifically, speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is shown having a larger proportion of channel coding <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to a smaller proportion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of voice coding <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Speech block <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, has approximately an even proportion <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of channel coding <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to voice coding <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. Speech block <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> has a larger proportion <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of channel coding <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to voice coding <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. In any case, from comparing speech blocks <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, it can be seen that the ratios of channel coding to voice coding may change, and even though three separate ratios have been shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, virtually any proportion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> may be implement with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition to having a variable quantity of voice data and channel coding, a speech block may also be encoded with a number of rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. These rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> represent the particular vocoder rate with which the voice data is encoded. For example, in a communication system where vocoder rates may be varied, rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> provide the necessary vocoder rate information to successfully decode the voice data. In a preferred embodiment, the rate bits are positioned within the speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, but are not convolutionally encoded with the voice data and channel coding. Rather, the rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;soft-coded&rdquo; into the speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> such that they can be extracted without the need for convolutionally decoding the speech block. The term &ldquo;extract&rdquo; in the present context may include convolutionally decoding, soft-decoding, hard-decoding, or any other manner of retrieving the digital information from the data stream known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;soft-coding&rdquo; of the rate bits may be accomplished by placing a series of bits within a particular location of the speech block. For example, rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> may be placed at bit positions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of speech blocks <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. By positioning the rate bits at consistent locations within each of the speech blocks, it is not necessary to decode the block to determine the value of the rate bits. Instead, the value of the bits in bit positions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and 72 could be determined simply by scanning those bits in the serial bit stream. Additionally, it is possible to place the rate bits in more than one location within each speech-block, providing for a measure of error correction. For example, rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> could occur in three separate locations within speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, allowing the averaging of the bits within the three separate locations in order to provide the best approximation of the rate bits despite any transmissions errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> may represent a three-bit binary value corresponding to eight distinct vocoder rates. Table 1 below identifies such a table of eight distinct vocoder rates based upon three rate bits. As can be seen from Table 1, the rate bits <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> may be assigned any vocoder rate within the vocoder range of the communication system.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> There are three (3) rate bits identified in Table 1, however, the number of rate bits may vary depending upon the total number of vocoder rates available. For instance, if only two rates are available, a single bit would be needed, with a bit value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; indicating one rate, and the bit value of &ldquo;1&rdquo; indicating the other rate. Similarly, if only four rates were available, two rate bits would be needed, with the bit values of &ldquo;00&rdquo; indicating a first vocoder rate, bit values of &ldquo;01&rdquo; indicating a second vocoder rate, bit values of &ldquo;10&rdquo; indicating a third vocoder rate, and bit values of &ldquo;11&rdquo; indicating a fourth vocoder rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Although Table 1 includes a series of eight (8) vocoder rates spaced 1 Kbits/s apart, it is to be appreciated that it is not necessary for the vocoder rates to be evenly distributed. In fact, it would be advantageous for the communication system of the present invention to have a number of vocoder rates within the operating range most frequently experienced by the system. For example, if the communication system noise and interference characteristics indicate that the vocoder rate would typically be 6 Kbits/s, then it might be advantageous to provide several vocoder rates within the 5 to 7 Kbits/s region in order to maximize the voice quality. In such an environment, a series of eight (8) vocoder rates might include the following vocoder rates: 4.0 Kbits/s, 5.0 Kbits/s, 5.5 Kbits/s, 6.0 Kbits/s, 6.5 Kbits/s, 7.0 Kbits/s, 8.0 Kbits/s, and 9.0 Kbits/s. Using these vocoder rates would allow the communication system to adjust the vocoder rate just slightly in order to provide the finest possible voice quality during periods of slight fluctuations in the channel noise and interference levels, while retaining the ability to significantly change the vocoder rate for periods of heavy channel noise and interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Once the voice data has been encoded with the necessary channel coding, and any rate coding, to form speech blocks <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, each speech block is divided into four (4) sub-blocks. For example, &ldquo;A&rdquo; speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is split into sub-blocks &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>. Likewise, &ldquo;B&rdquo; speech block <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is split into sub-blocks &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; speech block <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is split into sub-blocks &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the 228 bit data stream in the speech block is broken into four (4) sub-blocks of 57 bits each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Using a combination of sub-blocks, a multi-frame <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> is constructed which includes a continual string of data frames, with each data frame having eight (8) time slots <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>. As shown by mapping lines <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, frame <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> is constructed from the &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> and the &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. This combination of sub-blocks into frames <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> is called &ldquo;frame-interleaving&rdquo; and is intended to create a more robust communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In addition to this frame-interleaving, the even bits within frame <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> are comprised of the data bits of the &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and the odd bits within frame <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> are comprised of data bits of the &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. This even bit/odd bit combination is called &ldquo;bit-interleaving&rdquo; and results in the distribution of a single speech block over four contiguous frames. This distribution provides for an improved fault tolerance for the communication system, and in circumstances where the noise level and interference level are high, results in a more resilient communication channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In addition to the combination of sub-blocks <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, frame <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is also encoded with communication system specific coding. For example, using the GSM-based communication system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, frame <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is encoded with three (3) leading &ldquo;tail bits&rdquo; <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, a first &ldquo;encoded voice&rdquo; bit stream <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> of fifty-seven (57) bits, a single &ldquo;flag&rdquo; bit <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>, a twenty-eight bit &ldquo;training sequence&rdquo; <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, a second &ldquo;flag&rdquo; bit <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>, a second &ldquo;encoded voice&rdquo; bit stream <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> of fifty-seven (57) bits, three (3) trailing &ldquo;tail bits&rdquo; <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>, and an eight and one-quarter (8&frac14;) bit &ldquo;guard&rdquo; period <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. The first and second &ldquo;encoded voice&rdquo; bit streams <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> represent the encoded voice which was present in the &ldquo;B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and the &ldquo;A<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; sub-block <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, which included both the voice data, channel coding, and rate bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Because Doppler shift and multi-path echoes in system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can affect the received signal quality, each TDMA frame must include training sequence <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>, also called training bits. The receiver in system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> compares these training bits with a known training pattern, and from this deduces the transfer function of the propagation path. An adaptive filter is then created within processor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to perform the inverse transfer function, thus canceling any unacceptable distortion. This adaptive filtering is well known in the art, and is thus not discussed in more detail here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Because of the frame-interleaving and bit-interleaving employed in this GSM-based communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it is not possible to decode the voice information without re-assembling the sub-blocks <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> from successive frames <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> in multi-frame <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it is necessary for the digitally encoded voice information to be temporarily stored, such as by temporarily placing the encoded voice information into storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Once a sufficient number of frames has been stored in memory storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, the sub-blocks are then re-assembled and the voice data is decoded from the re-constructed speech blocks, removing all channel coding, and sent through switch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to vocoders <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A full-rate GSM-based system would assign each time slot within a frame to a different user. For example, each of the eight (8) time slots within a frame would be assigned to eight (8) different users. In a half-rate GSM-based system, the frame and slot timing remains the same, but instead of a user being assigned a time slot in every frame, the user is assigned a time slot in every other frame. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The operation for the present invention includes the modification of the vocoder rate and level of channel coding to provide the best possible voice quality, while ensuring a reliable communication channel. In order to determine the appropriate level of channel coding necessary to provide reliable communication, a number of channel quality metrics are considered by the present invention. Defined generally, these channel quality metrics include characteristics of the communication channel which may be measured, and by continually measuring these channel quality metrics, an accurate evaluation of the channel quality may be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> One channel metric used to evaluate the quality of the communication channel is the uncoded Bit Error Rate (BER). The uncoded BER of a communication channel is defined as the ratio of the number of bits in a data stream which are improperly demodulated to the total number of bits transmitted. In general, a bit error is caused when the noise power level in a communication system becomes comparable to the energy level in each bit transmitted. Consequently, in a system with a small channel-to-noise ratio (C/N), bit errors are more likely. Conversely, in a system with a large channel-to-noise ratio, bit errors are less likely. Thus, on a fundamental level, the rate of occurrence of bit errors, or the BER, provides an overall system quality metric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An additional metric which may be used to evaluate the quality of a communication channel is the RX Quality (RXQ) indicator. The RXQ indicator as generally known in the industry is assigned a value by the network, indicating the quality of the received signal based upon the current BER. Table 2 below includes values for a typical network-determined BER with corresponding RXQ values. This table, however, represents an average received quality, and not an instantaneous RXQ value.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The GSM standards for the RXQ of Table 1 is an average value measured during a predefined period of time. However, because the present invention contemplates an immediate response to a decrease in the RXQ value, it is necessary to determine the RXQ metric on a block-by-block basis. This block-by-block calculation of RXQ&prime;, for example, would be made within the MS for the downlink, and within the BS for the uplink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, an RXQ&prime; metric is defined and is dynamically measured by re-encoding the decoded voice data coming out of the convolutional decoder and comparing them against the received bits. The RXQ&prime; value represents the number of bits different between the received bits and the re-encoded bits per block. The RXQ&prime; consequently provides a combined indication of bit error rate and receiver quality for each block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the determination of the RXQ&prime; metric is accomplished by decoding the voice data from a speech block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> within a received frame <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, and re-coding the voice data for comparison to the encoded received data. The determination of the RXQ&prime; metric takes place within circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by receiving a transmitted frame <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> and passing the frame through transmit/receive switch <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier and mixer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, through ADC <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and equalizer <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, to channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. In channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is decoded to the original speech block which is then passed to storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for later use. Following storage of the original speech block, all channel coding is removed to recover the original voice data which may also be stored in storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, or passed on through switch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to vocoders <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> for conversion to audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Once the original voice data is recovered from channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, the now-decoded voice data is then re-encoded through a convolutional coding process identical to that of the channel encoder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to exactly re-create the original coded speech block. This re-encoding may be accomplished using channel decoder <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, or the voice data may be passed through a separate channel coder <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. By comparing the original speech block stored in storage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> with the newly re-coded speech block from channel coder <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>, an estimated bit-error-rate may be determined. For example, by comparing the received speech block with the re-coded speech block, the existence of any error-correction which has taken place within channel decoder will become apparent. Consequently, this dynamic method of error detection is considerably more sensitive than other estimates of the BER, and may be done on a block-by-block basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> An additional metric, SRXQ, is defined as the weighed sum of prior RXQ&prime; measurements. The SRXQ metric is intended to introduce some history into the vocoder rate decision making process based on the receiver quality. In one embodiment, the RXQ&prime; measurements for the prior five (5) blocks are considered in the SRXQ measurement. The prior RXQ&prime; measurements are weighted in accordance with the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>SRXQ&equals;SUM</italic></highlight>(2<highlight><superscript>K&minus;1</superscript></highlight>)(<highlight><italic>RXQ&prime;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>K&plus;</italic></highlight>4)); </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> where K&equals;&minus;4, &minus;3, &minus;2, &minus;1, and 0, and where RXQ&prime;(0) is the measured value for the most recent block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> An alternative channel quality metric, Frame Erase (FE), may be used to determine the overall quality of the channel. The FE metric represents the number of frames which have been determined to be corrupted, and consequently not used in re-generating the original voice data. In other words, the FE metric represents a count of the number of frames which have been erased per unit time. The decision to erase a frame may be made using a number of criterion. In a present embodiment, the determination to erase a frame is made based on the cyclic-redundancy-checking (CRC), also generally known as a &ldquo;parity&rdquo; check. Based on a CRC value which is decoded from the received frame, a frame is either used or discarded, avoiding the use of a frame which may have 0 been improperly decoded or otherwise corrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> System Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> state diagram is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. State diagram <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> represents the changes in vocoder and channel coding rates in response to changes in the communication system environment. For discussion purposes, it is assumed that the communication system is initially experiencing a high carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N), and thus the system is initially in state <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> having a relatively high vocoder rate of 8 Kbits/s, with a correspondingly low level of channel coding. In other words, state <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is used in low-noise environments, such as where the carrier-to-interference ration (C/I) exceeds 19 dB, wherein the majority of digital information with a speech block may be voice data. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will remain in state <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> so long as the FE metric remains at zero (0), as indicated by control path <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. This results in a communication system having a superior voice quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the event that a frame is erased resulting in the FE metric becoming non-zero, the BER is computed to determine whether it meets or exceeds a threshold value. In the present embodiment, this threshold value is one percent (1%), meaning that if more than one bit out of a total bit stream of one hundred (100) bits is erroneous, the threshold is met or exceeded. Once the FE metric becomes non-zero and the BER is above the one percent (1%) threshold, the system changes to state <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> via control path <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> State <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is used in environments exhibiting moderate levels of noise and interference, and combines a mid-range vocoder rate of 6 Kbits/s with a moderate level of channel coding. In the current example, the vocoder and channel coding rate will remain at the mid-range of state <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> so long as the BER is greater-than-or-equal-to one percent (1%), and less than five percent (5%) (1% &pound;BER&lt;5%). In this state, typically where the C/I is between 10 and 19 dB, the communication channel exhibits a reasonably good voice quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If after a period of time the communication environment improves and the FE metric returns to zero (0) and the BER becomes less than one percent (1%), the system returns to state <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> via control path <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, in the event the system environment becomes more noisy and the channel-to-noise ratio (C/N) becomes smaller, the FE metric will likely increase. If the FE metric increases to equal or exceed 5, and the BER metric is greater-than-or-equal-to 5 percent (5%), (FE&gt;5 and 5% &pound;BER) the system passes to state <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> via control path <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. In this state, a higher degree of channel coding is implemented resulting in a corresponding lower vocoder rate of 4 Kbits/s. According to control path <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, the system will remain in state <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> so long as the BER is greater-than-or-equal-to 5% (5% &pound;BER), typically when the C/I is between 4 to 10 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When the system is in state <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and the communication environment improves causing the FE metric to decrease to zero (0) and the BER metric to decrease to less than five percent (5%), than the communication system will change to state <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> according to control path <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, thereby decreasing the level of channel coding and improving the voice quality of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the event the communication system is in state <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the FE and BER metrics continue to increase, the communication system may eventually discontinue the communication channel resulting in a &ldquo;dropped call.&rdquo; In the present embodiment, the communication channel will be discontinued when the FE and BER rates exceed 20 and ten percent (10%), respectively, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure the proper operation of the system of the present invention, it is necessary that the metrics evaluated for determination of the system control between various states <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> include a measure of hysteresis. For example, if no hysteresis were to be included between states <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, it would be possible for the system to oscillate rapidly between the two states, resulting in a vocoder rate and level of channel coding which varies from frame to frame. Although this continual vocoder change is possible with the system of the present invention, it is unnecessary and may result in an inefficient use of system resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The discussion of the various FE and BER values set forth above is intended as one example of a preferred embodiment having three (3) different vocoder and channel coding rates. The FE and BER values set forth are merely exemplary, and any number of alternative FE and BER values may be chosen and implemented. The threshold values for the FE and BER values may be treated as system parameters, and may change for different vocoders. Also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a state diagram with three (3) states, however, any number of states may be created within the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Mobile Station Control of Downlink Rate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> flow chart representing the operation of the communication system of the present invention is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. In general, this configuration includes the MS determining the proper downlink vocoder rate and level of channel coding. Following this determination, the MS then transmits the necessary rate information to the BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Flow chart <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> begins with first step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> which includes reception of a radio-frequency frame at the MS. Following receipt of the frame at the MS, the soft-coded rate bits a re extracted from the frame data in step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention and as discussed above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, these soft-coded rate bits may include three (3) bits of rate information that can identify up to eight (8) different vocoder and channel coding rates. The frame data is then convolutionally decoded to yield the original speech block in step <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Using the appropriate vocoder and channel coding rate information extracted in step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the speech block is then decoded to recreate the original voice data in step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the MS may receive a frame containing voice data encoded with virtually any vocoder rate, and the frame may be successfully decoded to the original voice data because all relevant vocoder rate information is transmitted within the frame in the form of soft-coded bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the best possible voice communication channel, the MS determines the channel quality metrics discussed above, such as FE, BER and RXQ, in step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. The MS also calculates the SRXQ value in step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and, based upon the results of the measured and calculated metrics, determines the vocoder rate for optimal voice quality in step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rate bits corresponding to the new vocoder and channel coding rate are determined from a look-up table. Once the vocoder and channel coding rate is determined, the MS transmits a frame with the new downlink vocoder rate convolutionally coded into the frame in step <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. Uplink <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the MS to the BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, the BS receives the frame containing the convolutionally-coded downlink vocoder rate for the next downlink transmission. Because it is not necessary to know the downlink vocoder rate in order to decode the uplink transmission, the downlink vocoder rate may be convolutionally encoded instead of soft-coded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>, the BS decodes the received frame from the MS yielding the new downlink vocoder rate bits. These vocoder rate bits are used to determine, using a look-up table or the like, the new downlink vocoder rate. Using that newly determined vocoder rate, the BS encodes the voice data in step <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight> for transmission to the MS. In step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, the BS transmits the frame containing the convolutionally encoded voice data and coded downlink vocoder rate bits to the MS. Downlink <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the BS to the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Importantly, each downlink message includes as soft-coded bits the rate information related to the speech block. This is so because there exists a possibility that a frame may become corrupted and no longer readable. This corruption may create a situation wherein the MS may have transmitted a message frame in the uplink changing the downlink vocoder rate, and that frame was not successfully received by the BS. If this occurs, the MS would expect to receive a frame having a new vocoder rate, while the frame actually received would be encoded at the old rate. Additionally, in circumstances involving discontinuous transmissions (DTX), such as when the MS is not transmitting to save battery power, the channel characteristics and corresponding vocoder rate information could change significantly between transmitted frames. Consequently, in order to avoid such miscommunication, each speech block is soft-coded with the rate information necessary to decode the speech block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, steps within sequence <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> identified by bracket <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> are performed within the MS, and steps within sequence <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> identified by bracket <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> are performed within the BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In any one cycle of uplink-downlink transmissions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, both the BS and the MS will inform the other of the appropriate vocoder rates for the transmitted message. For example, in an uplink frame containing convolutionally-coded rate bits for the next downlink frame, soft-coded rate bits will be present which will tell the BS what vocoder rate to use in decoding the uplink frame. Similarly, in a downlink frame containing convolutionally-coded rate bits for the next uplink frame, soft-coded rate bits will be present which will tell the MS what vocoder rate to use in decoding that downlink frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the communication system of the present invention, it has been termed that vocoder rate bits which are not convolutionally encoded are &ldquo;soft-coded&rdquo; into the speech block, and the vocoder rate bits which are convolutionally encoder are &ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; into the speech block. As an alternative terminology, the vocoder rate information which is convolutionally encoded into a speech block could also be considered an &ldquo;inside&rdquo; rate, as the vocoder rate information is within the convolutional coding. Vocoder rate information which is soft-coded into the speech-block is considered an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; rate, as the vocoder rate information is outside the convolutional coding. </paragraph>

In general, this configuration includes the MS monitoring a series of channel metrics and relaying this metric information to the BS for determining the proper downlink vocoder rate and level of channel coding. Following this determination, the BS then transmits the soft-coded rate bits to the MS with the following frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In first step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, the MS receives a frame with soft-coded rate bits. In step <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, the MS extracts the soft-coded rate bits from the frame, and using a look-up table or the like, determines the appropriate downlink vocoder rate and level of channel coding. In step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, using this rate information, the MS decodes the frame, yielding a speech block. In step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, the vocoders are set to the appropriate rate and this speech block is decoded to re-create the original voice in the speech block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> During the decoding process, the MS is determining the channel quality of the communication system. For example, quality metrics such as FE and RXQ may be determined in step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. Following the determination of FE and RXQ, a quantized vocoder value is determined in step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> which reflects the current communication channel quality. Referring ahead briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> quantization table is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Quantization table <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> includes both the FE metric <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and the RXQ metric <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> which are measured at the MS, and lists a number of non-uniform quantization values for each. These RXQ&prime; values are the mid-range of the transmitted quantization levels, and represent a range of RXQ&prime; metric values. Since the FE and RXQ&prime; are both associated with the receiver performance, the quantization of RXQ&prime; is based on the value of FE to effectively quantize RXQ&prime; into eight levels. By locating the current measured values of both the FE and RXQ on the quantization table, a series of three (3) quantization bits are identified. For instance, for a FE value of 1 and a RXQ value of 25, quantization bits 1-0-0 are selected. Once the quantization bits are selected, in step <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> a frame is transmitted from the MS to the BS with the quantization bits fully encoded in the speech block. Uplink <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the MS to the BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, the frame is received at the BS with the quantization bits fully encoded. This frame is decoded in step <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> to yield the original quantization bits. Referring briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> quantization table <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is shown which provides a look-up table to reconstruct the FE and RXQ&prime; values from the received quantization bits. For example, for quantization bits 1-0-0, a FE metric value <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;1&rdquo; and an RXQ metric value <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;22.&rdquo; These metrics derived from the quantization bits are then used to calculate the SRXQ metric in step <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. Based upon the quantization bits and the results of the SRXQ calculation, a new vocoder rate is determined in step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> by the MS. In step <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, voice data for the next speech block is encoded using the new vocoder rate, with the new vocoder rate bits being soft-coded into the speech block resulting in a new frame. This new frame is then transmitted from the BS to the MS in step <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>. Downlink <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the BS to the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Base Station Control of Unlink </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In addition to the rate bits which are exchanged between the MS and the BS to govern the downlink vocoder and channel coding rate, the rate bits corresponding to the operation of the uplink are also exchanged. This is accomplished by the BS analyzing similar channel quality metrics which are used to determine the appropriate downlink vocoder rate as discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> flow chart representing the operation of an alternative embodiment of the communication system of the present invention is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In general, this configuration includes the BS monitoring a series of channel metrics determines the proper uplink vocoder rate and level of channel coding. Following this determination, the MS then transmits the soft-coded rate bits to the BS with the following frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Flow chart <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> begins with first step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> which includes reception of a radio-frequency frame at the BS. Following receipt of the frame at the BS, the soft-coded rate bits are extracted from the frame data in step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention and as discussed above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, these soft-coded rate bits may include three (3) bits of rate information that can identify up to eight (8) different vocoder and channel coding rates. The frame data is then convolutionally decoded to yield the original speech block in step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Using the appropriate vocoder and channel coding rate information extracted in step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the speech block is then decoded to recreate the original voice data in step <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the BS may receive a frame containing voice data encoded with virtually any vocoder rate, and the frame may be successfully decoded to the original voice data because all relevant vocoder rate information is transmitted within the frame in the form of soft-coded bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the best possible voice communication channel, the BS determines the channel quality metrics discussed above, such as FE, BER and RXQ, in step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The BS also calculates the SRXQ value in step <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> and, based upon the results of the measured and calculated metrics, determines the vocoder rate for optimal voice quality in step <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rate bits corresponding to the new vocoder and channel coding rate are determined from a look-up table. Once the vocoder and channel coding rate is determined, the BS transmits a frame with the new uplink vocoder rate convolutionally coded into the frame in step <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>. Downlink <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the BS to the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, the MS receives the frame containing the convolutionally-coded uplink vocoder rate for the next downlink transmission. Because it is not necessary to know the uplink vocoder rate in order to decode the uplink transmission, the uplink vocoder rate may be convolutionally encoded instead of soft-coded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>, the MS decodes the received frame from the BS yielding the new uplink vocoder rate bits. These vocoder rate bits are used to determine, using a look-up table or the like, the new uplink vocoder rate. Using that newly determined vocoder rate, the MS encodes the voice data in step <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> for transmission to the BS. In step <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight>, the MS transmits the frame containing the convolutionally encoded voice data and soft-coded uplink vocoder rate bits to the BS. Uplink <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight> represents the transmission of a frame from the MS to the BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Importantly, each uplink message includes as soft-coded bits the rate information related to the speech block. This soft-coding enables the BS to properly decode the speech block without knowing in advance the vocoder rate. This is particularly advantageous because there exists a possibility that a frame may become corrupted and no longer readable. This corruption may create a situation wherein the BS may have transmitted a message frame in the downlink changing the uplink vocoder rate, and that frame was not successfully received by the MS. If this occurs, the BS would expect to receive a frame having a new vocoder rate, while the frame actually received would be encoded at the old rate. Additionally, in circumstances involving discontinuous transmissions (DTX), such as when the BS is not continuously transmitting, the channel characteristics and corresponding vocoder rate information could change significantly between transmitted frames. Consequently, in order to avoid such miscommunication, each speech block is soft-coded with the rate information necessary to decode the speech block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, steps within sequence <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> identified by bracket <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> are performed within the BS, and steps within sequence <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> identified by bracket <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight> are performed within the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> System Performance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The communication system of the present invention provides for the block and bit interleaving thereby minimizing the disruption to the communication link caused by channel noise, interference, and dropped frames. In addition to such redundancy, the vocoder rate information which is either hard-coded within the frame or soft-coded outside the frame, may also be repetitive. Such repetition will further enhance the resilience of the communication system of the present invention. Redundancy of the vocoder rate information, or rate bits, may be accomplished by repeating the bits in several locations within the speech frame, as mentioned above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Like traditional GSM-based communication systems, the communication system of the present invention provides for the transfer, or &ldquo;hand-off,&rdquo; of a MS from one BS to another BS in a different cell. In such a hand-off, it would not be necessary to provide the new BS with any special rate information via the communication link <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as all necessary vocoder rate information is presented in each frame transmitted from the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be implemented in either a full-rate or half-rate GSM-based communication system. The encoding and transmission of the vocoder rate information between the BS and MS in both the full and half-rate system would be identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition to the modification of the vocoder rate and channel coding as discussed above, the power level of the transmissions may also be modified in order to provide the best possible voice quality. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, rate bits <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may take into consideration, in addition to the FE and RXQ&prime; metrics, a metric related to the power level of the transmission. In such a situation, the BS may adjust the vocoder rate&prime; and channel coding, while at the same time adjusting the BS transmit power to minimize the BER or FE, resulting in better voice quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been discussed at length with respect to the transmission of voice data between a BS and a MS, it should be appreciated that any digital data may be communicated in a similar manner. In fact, because other types of digital data may not be dependent upon the audio sampling rates, a much higher data rate may be achieved using the present invention, and is fully contemplated herein. </paragraph>
