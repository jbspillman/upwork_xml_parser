<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Medical devices configured for minimally invasive surgery are rapidly becoming the tools of choice for many surgical procedures. Not only do these devices provide an alternative to more invasive surgical tools and procedures, but they have also fostered the development of entirely new procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Devices including highly flexible catheters, as well as rigid and semi-flexible probes have received increased attention in recent years and continue to be refined for cardiovascular, pulmonary, urogenital, and other applications. Devices for each of these applications present different technology and material challenges. Angioplasty catheters, for example, can require fluid-tight passages or channels for circulating a cooling fluid (liquid or gas) through a catheter to cool an electro-surgical structure, such as radio frequency ablation electrode, to prevent overheating of the electrode or of surrounding tissue. Similarly, a cooling or cryogenic fluid can be reduce the temperature of a structure, such as an ablation surface, to a therapeutic temperature. Some cooling fluids, however, can be harmful or fatal to the patient if they unintentionally escape from the surgical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although careful fabrication techniques, quality materials, and thorough testing can reduce the chances of cooing fluid leakage, it would be desirable to provide additional system features that further minimize the occurrence of leaks; and should a leak occur, provide features that detect cooling fluid loss or escape immediately so that use of the surgical device can be terminated and patient remediation efforts can be undertaken if required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the discussion which follows, &ldquo;surgical device&rdquo; is intended to encompass any surgical implement used in association with human or animal medical treatment, diagnosis, study, or analysis. More particularly, a surgical device is intended to encompass any implement or portion thereof that is entirely or partially inserted into a human or animal body by any means of entry, such as through a natural body orifice, an incision, or a puncture. The term surgical device is not intended to connote a limitation to treatment of a single body system, organ, or site. The surgical device can be rigid as a thick steel pipe, completely flexible and pliant like a thread, or have a flexibility between the two extremes. The surgical device can have a diameter that ranges from inches to microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As used herein. &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; is intended to encompass materials in a liquid state, a gas state, or in a transition state between liquid and gas, and liquid and solid. The fluid can be a &ldquo;cryogenic fluid&rdquo; capable of reaching or creating extremely cold temperatures well below the freezing point of water, such as below minus 20 degrees Centigrade; a &ldquo;cooling fluid&rdquo; that does not reach or create temperatures below the freezing point of water; a fluid capable of transferring heat away from a relatively warmer structure or body tissue; a fluid capable of transferring heat to a relatively cooler structure or body tissue; a fluid at or capable of creating a temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water; and a fluid at or capable of reaching or creating a temperature above the boiling point of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;fluid path&rdquo; as used herein is intended to encompass any boundary, channel or guide through which a fluid can travel. It can include concentrically disposed catheters, multi-lumen catheters, or a single loop of tubing within a sheath. The fluid path can also include connectors and valves, as well as passages in support equipment, such as the console disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary surgical device is illustrated for minimally invasive surgery. The surgical device includes a console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a multi-lumen catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> houses electronics and software for controlling and recording a surgical procedure, such as ablation, and it controls delivery of liquid refrigerant under high pressure from a supply container <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, through an umbilical <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A second umbilical <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided for transferring refrigerant from the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for recovery of expanded refrigerant vapor from the catheter and recompression of the vapor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Either or both of the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be provided with detection devices that are in electrical communication with the console and which provide a signal output that can be representative of an event that indicates flow path integrity loss or a leak within a sealed catheter and/or console. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first detection device or leak detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be provided in a body or tip portion of the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A second leak detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be provided in the handle portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; and a third leak detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be provided in the console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be configured to respond to signal output from the leak detectors and initiate a predetermined sequence of events, such as discontinuing refrigerant injection, changing the pressure within the system, and controlling removal of refrigerant from the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The purpose and function of the leak detectors is better understood once another feature of the invention is introduced, namely, a vacuum pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in fluid communication with a catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The third leak detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be interposed between the vacuum pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the catheter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The vacuum pump <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is controllable to reduce the pressure within the return lumen of the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second umbilical <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to provide a pressure ranging from a pure vacuum to a pressure just below a patient&apos;s blood pressure. For example, the vacuum can maintain a selected pressure between 80 mm Hg and 0 mm Hg. The provision of reduced pressure within the return flow path of the catheter significantly enhances patient safety because, should a leak occur, refrigerant will not squirt from the leak into the patient. Rather, bodily fluids in the treatment site will be aspirated into the catheter whereupon they are sensed by one or more of the leak detectors. In one mode of operation, when a leak is detected, the refrigerant injection is turned off automatically and vacuum is kept on to ensure that no refrigerant enters the patient&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although a single type of leak detector could be functional, an exemplary embodiment of the invention is provided with three different types of leak detectors for enhanced detection probability. For example, the first leak detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be a simple circuit formed by a wire, such as a pull-wire used to help steer the catheter tip, and a conductive catheter tip portion. Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> wire <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is electrically isolated from a metal catheter tip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and metal electrode rings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wire is secured to a non-conductive support element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also shown is a refrigerant injection tube <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The electrical impedance between the wire <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the catheter tip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is monitored. If a liquid enters the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and touches the wire <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the tip <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a short is created which is detectable by circuitry in the console. Alternatively, the wire <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and one or more of the electrode rings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be included in the impedance circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, some catheters <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include multiple conductors running within one or more lumens and electrical insulation on the conductors is necessary to avoid unwanted electrical connections and interferences. Many such catheters also contain uninsulated wires, for example as mechanical deflectors to alter catheter configuration, or for example as stiffening agents to alter catheter flexibility or pushability. However, if the pull wire (or other wire that is part of the leak detection circiut) contacts another uninsulated wire, electrode ring or other conductive element, a false leak detection signal could be generated. Accordingly, a form of insulation that provides mechanical insulation while allowing fluid conductivity is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> discloses a wire <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (such as a pull wire) that is part of the leak detection circuit. The wire <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is covered with a porous material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, such as a fabric, salt-depleted polymer, or laser drilled polymer, that provides mechanical insulation in the dry state by the physical bulk and separation of the porous material, which allows passage of ionic fluids to the thus insulated wire to complete the electrical leak detection circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Although the first leak detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is well suited for detecting leaks at or near the distal end of the catheter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a leak may develop between the distal end and the handle portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the catheter and an infrared sensor can be disposed in the handle as the second leak detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As soon as the first and/or second leak detectors output a signal to the console indicative of a leak, the refrigerant injection can be stopped. In an exemplary embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an infrared sensor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with a wavelength sensitive to blood composition is disposed in sensing range with a transparent window <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or tube along or forming part of the return fluid flow path <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Even though refrigerant injection is stopped, it can still be desirable to apply vacuum to the catheter to withdraw refrigerant already introduced into the catheter, along with refrigerant contaminated blood. Thus, a third leak detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is provided further downstream in the fluid flow path to not only provide a last opportunity for detection, but to also detect when a selected volume of blood has been aspirated (a relatively small amount) and to then terminate vacuum operation or aspiration. Depending on placement of the third leak detector, it can prevent blood contamination of the entire fluid flow path within the console <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been shown with respect to exemplary embodiments thereof, various other changes, omissions and additions in form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</paragraph>
