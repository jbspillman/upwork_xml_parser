<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to improved ride surfaces for sliding-type ride attractions, water rides and the like and, in particular, to a variably tensionable membrane ride surface for a simulated surfing wave ride attraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Water parks and water ride attractions have increased in popularity over the years as an enjoyable family diversion during the hot summer months. Each year water parks invest hundreds of thousands of dollars for ever larger and more exciting water ride attractions to attract increasing numbers of park patrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One particularly exciting attraction is the simulated surfing wave water ride attraction known commercially as Flow Rider&reg;. In this attraction, riders ride upon an injected flow of high-speed sheet water flow that is continuously propelled up an inclined ride surface. The thickness and velocity of the injected sheet flow relative to the angle of the inclined ride surface is such that it creates simultaneously a hydroplaning or sliding effect between the ride surface and the rider and/or ride vehicle and also a drag or pulling effect upon a rider and/or ride vehicle hydroplaning upon the sheet flow. By balancing the upward-acting drag forces and the downward-acting gravitational forces, skilled riders are able to maneuver a surfboard (or &ldquo;flow board&rdquo;) upon the injected sheet water flow and perform surfing-like water skimming maneuvers thereon for extended periods of time thereby achieving a simulated and/or enhanced surfing wave experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, my U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,280, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, first disclosed the concept of an artificial simulated wave water ride attraction of this type having an inclined ride surface covered with an injected sheet flow of water upon which riders could perform water skimming maneuvers simulative of actual ocean surfing. Sheet flow water rides are currently in widespread use at many water parks and other locations around the world. Such rides allow the creation of an ideal live-action surfing wave experience even in areas that do not have access to beaches or an ocean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other similar attractions have enjoyed immense popularity among park-going patrons. Owners and operators of park facilities that have installed such attractions have enjoyed significant improvements in park patronage due to the simulated wave water ride attractions and the particularly desirable patrons they attract. In fact, some park owners have demanded more challenging and larger, more powerful wave ride attractions in a bid to attract the most skilled and masterful riders to their parks and to accommodate large-scale professional competitions and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, current manufacturing techniques are limited in the ability to inexpensively produce large-scale surfing wave ride attractions and the like (e.g. slides, flumes, water coasters, bowls, half-pipes, etc.). According to the current state of the art, ride surfaces for such attractions are generally fabricated from concrete and/or one or more pre-molded fiberglass sections which are sanded smooth and then bolted or otherwise assembled together to form a single, generally continuous ride surface. The ride surface is typically assembled on site and secured to a suitable supporting framework. For ride surfaces susceptible to impacts from riders, a lubricious and/or soft coated foam material is typically adhered or bonded to the exposed &ldquo;hard&rdquo; upper concrete or fiberglass support surface to provide a composite ride surface that is both strong enough to support one or more riders, while providing a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; non-injurious surface to riders who may fall thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Such composite foam/fiberglass/concrete ride surfaces are expensive and time-consuming to produce. They also suffer from certain physical and other limitations which have made these and other similar composite ride surfaces cost-prohibitive for larger-width ride attractions. The physical demands placed on the ride surface dramatically increase with width, sometimes requiring additional engineering and structural reinforcement to ensure adequate safety and durability. Also, due to size limitations of standard commercial shipping containers, it is often commercially infeasible to prefabricate a large, contoured ride surface as a single integral structure. Presently, most large ride surfaces are poured in concrete on-site and sculpted by hand using highly skilled laborers. But this is an expensive and time-consuming process and depends upon the availability of a suitably skilled local labor force. An alternative approach includes assembling a large number of smaller fiberglass components or sections and securing them to an underlying supporting framework on site. However, this manufacturing and assembly technique produces undesirable seams which can have an adverse affect on the compliance and support characteristics of the underlying ride surface. Because these seams create discontinuities in an otherwise continuous, ride surface, certain latent or imposed stresses, such as thermal expansion and contraction, can have a tendency to focus or concentrate strain energy at the seams, leading to possible buckling and/or cracking of the ride surface at or around the seams. This, in turn, can create undesirable warpage and/or rippling of the ride surface, which can adversely affect ride performance and increase maintenance costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, the coated foam material is typically available commercially in only limited widths. Thus, for wider ride surfaces multiple swaths of such foam material must be adhered or bonded to the underlying support surface in a side-by-side fashion with closely abutting edges. But perfectly contiguous alignment and abutment is a difficult condition to achieve and, in any event, the technique creates undesirable seams which are susceptible to ripping, tearing or peeling in addition to some or all of the other deleterious effects described above. The seams in the foam covering and/or the foam covering itself can often leak and thereby admit water in between the foam material and the underlying fiberglass ride surface and/or in between the foam material and the lubricious surface coating thereon. This can cause the formation of undesirable &ldquo;blisters&rdquo; which, again, can adversely affect ride performance. If not immediately arrested, the blisters can quickly degenerate into a major ride surface delamination problem, possibly requiring complete resurfacing of the ride surface. Again, this increases the expense of maintaining a ride attraction having such composite foam/fiberglass/concrete ride surface or other &ldquo;hard&rdquo; support surface. These and other manufacturing and structural hurdles have made the large ride attractions quite expensive to construct and maintain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Current state-of-the-art composite fiberglass and concrete ride surfaces&mdash;due to their rigid and static nature&mdash;also fail to filly simulate the kinematic motion and reactive hydraulic forces or &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; associated with true deep-water ocean surfing. A stiff, unyielding ride surface can thus impair or hinder ride performance and maneuverability of amateur riders, particularly in flat or gently curved sections of the ride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for an alternative ride surface and method of fabrication thereof which does not suffer from all or some of the aforenoted drawbacks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A ride surface constructed in accordance with the present invention overcomes some or all of the aforenoted drawbacks and disadvantages. In one preferred embodiment the invention provides a membrane ride surface fabricated from a relatively inexpensive fabric, plastic film or composite material that is placed under tension over a supporting framework. Advantageously, the tensioned membrane ride surface in accordance with the invention serves the dual purpose of providing structural support for water flow and riders thereon while at the same time providing an impact safe surface that is non-injurious to riders who may fall thereon. Because the membrane material serves both support and impact functions, there is no need to adhere an additional foam layer material thereon to provide protection from rider impacts. This results in a less-expensive, more durable and long-lasting ride surface that is not afflicted by the aforementioned blistering and delamination problems. Moreover, because the membrane is stretched and tensioned to form a supporting ride surface, it is capable of absorbing significantly more energy during rider impact, as compared to a layer of soft foam material adhered to a relatively hard fiberglass support surface. Thus it is safer for riders and facilitates more extreme and exciting maneuvering, such as flips, spins, twists, lip bashes, and cartwheels, with a greater degree of safety. Advantageously, the membrane is also capable of supporting varying tensions and so the compliance or &ldquo;trampoline effect&rdquo; of the ride surface can be adjusted to provide a desired level of bounce and reactive forces to accommodate varying rider skill levels and/or to provide a more &ldquo;deep water&rdquo; surfing feel by more closely simulating the hydraulic forces associated with deep-water surfing on a propagating ocean wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Suitable membrane materials can be purchased and/or glued/hemmed/welded together to form any desired width of contiguous material. Thus a single integral ride surfacing material may be provided that can easily be packaged and shipped using standard shipping containers and the like. The ride surface and the underlying supporting frame can easily be assembled and adjusted on site with standard assembly tooling (e.g., a ratchet, wrench, and tensioning bar). Thus, on-site labor and material costs are significantly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The membrane ride surface is preferably formed from a substantially contiguous sheet of fabric/plastic and/or other strong, pliable sheet material. The membrane is tensioned at its edges to provide the desired rigidity to support a sheet water flow and riders thereon while at the same time providing sufficient compliance to provide energy absorption in the event of a fallen rider impacting the ride surface. Advantageously, the tensioned membrane design provides inherent flexibility in that the tension of the membrane can be adjusted actively and/or passively in order to accommodate different and varied ride experiences. Also, the shape of the membrane ride surface (and, thus, the size, shape and nature of the sheet water flow and simulated wave forms thereon) can be changed either actively or passively by special tensioning techniques and/or by using air bladders, pressure/suction, foam supports or/or the like. Thus, the invention provides heretofore unknown flexibility and wave riding challenge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the invention provides a ride attraction comprising an inclined ride surface adapted to safely support one or more ride participants and/or ride vehicles sliding thereon. The inclined ride surface comprises a substantially continuous sheet of membrane material supported along at least two edges thereof by a supporting framework. The membrane material has a coating thereon, such as a fluorinated polymer, adapted to provide a substantially smooth and generally lubricous sliding surface. The membrane material is tensioned so as to provide a resilient, impact-safe support surface for ride participants and/or ride vehicles sliding thereon. One or more nozzles may be further provided for injecting a sheet flow of water upon the ride surface and thereby simulating an ocean surfing experience. Auxiliary support structures may be added for additional support of the ride surface and/or to create various desired dynamic ride effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the invention provides a ride surface for ride attractions and the like. The ride surface comprises a fabric-reinforced membrane material supported by a structural framework tensioning the fabric-reinforced material to at least about 10 Kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm. The membrane material is coated with a friction-reducing material adapted to facilitate sliding thereon by ride patrons. If desired, one or more nozzles may be provided for injecting a sheet flow of water upon the ride surface and thereby simulating an ocean surfing experience. Auxiliary support structures may also be added for additional support of the ride surface and/or to create various desired dynamic ride effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the invention provides a kit for assembling a ride attraction. The kit comprises a fabric-reinforced ride surface sized and adapted to safely support one or more ride participants and/or ride vehicles thereon. A supporting framework is also provided and is adapted to support and apply tension to the membrane ride surface. Tensioning means are provided for adjusting the amount of tension applied by the framework to the ride surface whereby a resilient supporting surface is provided for safely supporting one or more riders. Again, one or more nozzles may be further provided, if desired, for injecting a sheet flow of water upon the ride surface and thereby simulating an ocean surfing experience. Auxiliary support structures may also be added for additional support of the ride surface and/or to create various desired dynamic ride effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For purposes of summarizing the invention and the advantages achieved over the prior art, certain objects and advantages of the invention have been described herein above. Of course, it is to be understood that not necessarily all such objects or advantages may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other objects or advantages as may be taught or suggested herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an isometric view of a simulated surfing wave ride attraction <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> incorporating a tensioned membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partial schematic, longitudinal cross-section view of the ride attraction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> while in operation, illustrating in more detail the hydraulic and operational characteristics and components thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the ride attraction <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally comprises an inclined fabric/membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (measuring approximately 7.0 m long&times;5.0 m wide) tensioned over a supporting framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as illustrated. Framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises multiple tensioning spars <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, as illustrated. If desired, the framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be supported by an optional sub-support system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which may further include a sub-support foundation (not shown), one or more water reservoirs <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and/or safety railings/sidewalls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> the lower portion of the inclined ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is positioned relative to one or more water injection nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> so as to receive a high speed sheet flow of water <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> thereon. The nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are preferably made of either steel, fiberglass, reinforced concrete or other structurally sound material that can withstand water pressures of 8 to 45 psi (0.5 to 3 bar). The vertical opening or sluice gate <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of each nozzle is preferably about 4 to 30 cm with a preferred opening of about 7.5 cm. The beak like shape of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> provides a compact form and thus advantageously minimizes the overall height of the fixed decking <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> above the emitted sheet flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In operation (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), water is injected onto the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by one or more high-pressure pumps <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> placed in hydraulic communication with one or more of the water injection nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The pumps <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> provide the primary driving mechanism and generates the necessary head or water pressure needed to deliver the required quantity and velocity of water from the flow forming nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A portion of the water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, if lacking sufficient kinetic energy to flow over the ridgeline <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, rolls down and off to the side of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> along either side of the emitted flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, draining though side exit grates <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> adjacent nozzles <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>A). Side grates <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are preferably made from extruded fiberglass covered with a soft vinyl tube matting. The majority of emitted sheet water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>&prime; flows over the top of the ride surface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and drains through a porous recovery floor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The recovery floor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to support &ldquo;wiped-out&rdquo; riders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and enable them to stand up and exit the ride attraction <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> while simultaneously allowing water to drain back into reservoir <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the porous recovery floor <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> comprises an extruded fiberglass grate covered with a soft vinyl tube matting or perforated rubberized matting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Two preferred alternative hydraulic/pump configurations are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> (vertical pumps) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B (horizontal pumps). Horizontal pump placement is generally preferred for minimizing excavation and subterranean depth, while vertical placement is preferred for ease of ease of pump maintenance and replacement. Of course, the pumps could also be angled or otherwise configured or arranged in any manner desirable or necessary to provide optimal performance and operational efficiency. Other than as specifically described herein, the particular pump/hydraulic systems layout and operations of the ride attraction <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are relatively unimportant for purposes of understanding and practicing the present invention. Nevertheless, if desired, a more complete understanding thereof may be had by reference to my U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,317, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully reproduced herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The thickness and velocity of the injected sheet flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> relative to the angle of the inclined ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably such that it creates simultaneously a hydroplaning or sliding effect between the ride surface and a rider/vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereon and also an upward directed drag or pulling effect upon the rider/vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> hydroplaning upon the sheet flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. By balancing the upward-acting drag forces and the downward-acting gravitational forces, a skilled rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to maneuver a specially modified surfboard <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;flow board&rdquo;) or body board upon the injected sheet water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and generally perform surfing-like water skimming maneuvers thereon for extended periods of time, thereby achieving a simulated and/or enhanced surfing wave experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In particular, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> a rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to ride and perform surfing/skimming maneuvers upon the upward flowing sheet water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and to thereby control his speed and position upon the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through a balance of forces, e.g., gravity, drag, hydrodynamic lift, buoyancy, and self-induced kinetic motion. For example, the rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can maximizing the hydroplaning characteristics of his or her ride vehicle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by sliding down the inclined ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and over the upcoming flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> while removing drag inducing surfaces such as hands and feet from the water flow. On the other hand, the rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can reverse this process and move back up the incline with the water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> by positioning or angling his vehicle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to reduce planing ability and/or by inserting hands and feet into the water flow to increase drag. A variety of surfing-like maneuvers such as turns, cuts, cross-slope runs, lip-bashing, oscillating and many others are facilitated. Because the membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is flexible and, therefore, movable under the weight of the rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to balance and react to varying pressures exerted on, and counter-pressures exerted by, the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This trampoline-like compliance also makes the ride safer for riders and, thus, facilitates more extreme and more exciting &ldquo;trick&rdquo; maneuvers, such as flips, spins, twists, lip bashes, and cartwheels, with a greater degree of safety. Advantageously, the membrane can be adjusted to provide a desired level of bounce and reactive forces to accommodate varying rider skill levels and/or to provide a more &ldquo;deep water&rdquo; surfing feel by more closely simulating the hydraulic forces associated with deepwater surfing on a propagating ocean wave, thereby adding to the overall ride experience and challenge of the ride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, if desired a soft foam sluice cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may be provided adjacent the lower end of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> over the exit or sluice portion of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to provide an energy-absorbing and/or slide-over safety structure that protects riders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from possibly colliding with the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or interfering with ride operation. The sluice cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> preferably forms a flexible tongue which is urged downward upon the water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to seal the nozzle area off from possible injurious contact from a rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The sluice cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> also advantageously provides a short transition surface over the top of which a rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can safely slide and exit the ride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The sluice cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a contoured flexible pad which covers and extends over the top surface of the nozzle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The pad is preferably spring-loaded in a downward direction to keep spring tension against the jetted water flow <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and thus minimize the possibility of a rider <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> catching a finger underneath the pad when sliding up and over the pad. The pad ranges from {fraction (1/16)}th inch thick at it furthest downstream point to approximately 1 inch thick where it abuts to a fixed decking <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The pad is preferably made out of any suitable soft flexible material that will avoid injury upon impact, yet rigid enough to hold its shape under prolonged use. Suitable pad materials include a 2 lb (0.9 kg) density closed cell polyurethane foam core that is coated with a tough but resilient rubber or plastic, e.g., polyurethane paint or vinyl laminate. See, for example, my published PCT application PCT/US00/21196 designated as publication number W001/08770, hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Alternatively, the sluice slide over cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may comprise a flexible pad to which is bonded or upholstered a membrane material similar to that described herein-above for ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Of course, a variety of other suitable designs and materials may also be used as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably fabricated from a suitably strong fabric/membrane material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that is suitably tensioned over an underlying supporting framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The membrane is preferably tensioned at its edges to provide the desired rigidity to support a sheet water flow and riders thereon. Advantageously, the tensioned membrane design provides inherent versatility in that the tension of the membrane can be adjusted actively and/or passively in order to accommodate different and varied ride experiences. Also, the shape of the membrane ride surface can be changed either actively or passively by special tensioning techniques and/or by using air bladders, suction, foam supports or/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable fabric/membrane materials include a wide variety of sheet or fabric materials formed from fibers or yarns comprising one or more of the following: carbon fiber, Kevlar&reg;, rayon, nylon, polyester, PVC, PVDF and/or similarly strong, durable fibrous materials. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,574,107 to Ferrari, incorporated herein by reference. As illustrated in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the yarns <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> comprising fabric/membrane <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be woven, knitted, extruded or otherwise formed or intertwined in any number of suitable weaves or patterns as manufacturing expedients dictate. Preferably, the fabric/membrane material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a smooth flexible coating <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> on one or both sides in order to provide a lubricious, generally water-tight ride surface <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Suitable coating materials <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> may include, for example and without limitation, rubber, polyurethane, latex, Teflon, fluorinated polymers, PVDF and/or the like. Preferably, such coated fabric material is substantially smooth and free of sharp or abrasive edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One particularly preferred type of membrane material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises high-strength polyester 1670/2200 Dtex PES HT yams woven to form a high-strength fabric base cloth. The base cloth is preferably tensioned substantially equally in weft and warp while a polymer coating approximately 200-300 &mgr;m thick is applied to the top and bottom surfaces thereof. The upper surface <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (the ride surface) is additionally coated with a fluorinated polymer material <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, such as PVDF, approximately 10-50 &mgr;m thick, providing a durable, lubricious sliding surface. Preferably, the finished fabric/membrane material has an overall thickness of between about 0.5 and 2.0 mm (1.2 mm being most preferred) and a weight less than about 5.0 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, more preferably less than about 2.0 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and most preferably about 1.5 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Suitable fabric/membrane materials are preferably selected to have a tensile strength greater than about 20 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm, more preferably greater than about 50 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm, and most preferably greater than about 80 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>cm as determined by NF EN ISO 1421 FTMS <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>A (Method 5102), and a tear strength preferably greater than about 50 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>, more preferably greater than about 75 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>, and most preferably greater than about 90 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>, as determined by DIN 53.363 ASTM D 5733-95 (Trapezoid Method), and with a maximum elongation under design load of preferably less than about 1% in either weft or warp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Suitable materials meeting the above preferred specifications are readily available commercially in relatively wide swaths. If desired, multiple swaths of fabric/membrane material can also be hemmed, glued or, more preferably, welded together to form very wide continuous swaths of continuous material to meet virtually any ride surfacing need. Thus a single integral ride surfacing material is provided that can easily be packaged and shipped using standard containers and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the tensioned membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention serves the dual purpose of providing adequate support for water flow and riders thereon while at the same time providing an impact-safe surface that is non-injurious to riders who may fall thereon. Because the membrane material serves both functions, there is no need to adhere an additional foam layer material thereon to provide protection from rider impacts. As noted above, this results in significant cost savings and also avoids the afore-mentioned blistering and delamination problems. Thus a safer, more durable and inexpensive ride surface is provided. Moreover, the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the underlying supporting frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can easily be assembled and adjusted on site using standard hand-tools, reducing on-site labor and material costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the membrane material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is maintained in tension via multiple tensioning spars <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> distributed along the length of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, each tensioning spar <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is preferably shaped and configured to adequately support the membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at the edges thereof, while simultaneously applying a desired tension thereto in at least one direction across the membrane. Tensioning may be desirably accomplished using any number of suitable devices and/or techniques. One preferred technique is to use a hydraulic tensioning jack <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and jacking frame <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. The jacking frame <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> bears against the frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or spar <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to pull or tension the membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> across the tensioning spar. Once the tension is set by the tensioning jack, the membrane material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be secured to the frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> using an adjustment collar <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> comprising one or more pins inserted through a series of spaced adjustment holes <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>) and/or using any number of other suitable fasteners, as desired. Alternatively, the hydraulic jack may be actively and/or remotely controlled to provide dynamic tensioning of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, one or more screw tensioners may be provided for purposes of providing simple tension adjustments as will be well understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the amount and direction(s) of tension applied to the membrane is such that the membrane material <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> forms a resilient supporting surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> capable of supporting a sheet flow of water thereon and one or more riders, while providing a compliant, energy-absorbing surface capable of safely absorbing the impact of possible fallen riders thereon. A preferred range of tension is between about 10 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm and 80 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm, more preferably between about 20 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm and 60 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm, and most preferably between about 30 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm and 40 kg<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/cm. If desired, one or more spring-biased elements may also be used, in order to provide tension overload regulation and to thereby protect the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> from tearing in the event of a very large or unexpected impact force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-D, preferably the fabric/membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is secured to the supporting frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via one or more structural perimeter tubes or the like. For example, the fabric membrane material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be wrapped around the perimeter tube <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and then sewed or welded to itself to form a sling <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> which receives and holds the membrane material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the perimeter tube <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> (see, e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-C). Alternatively and/or in addition, one or more mounting clamp members <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may be provided for retaining a free end of the membrane material against the perimeter tube <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. If desired, both mounting systems may be implemented so as to have a redundant safety system in the event one securement fails. Optionally, a soft foam cushion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be provided on each side of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for added safety and protection of riders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see, e.g., FIG SD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the supporting framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is be shaped and/or the membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is selectively tensioned (evenly or unevenly) so as to impart a desired slope and/or curvature to the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as desired. The curvature may be a simple curve as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or it may include one or more compound curving, twisting, bowing, and/or bulging portions, as desired or as dictated by the particular ride application. For example, in the particular embodiment illustrated, the supporting framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shaped and configured so as to induce a simple upward accelerating curvature to the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for supporting an injected sheet flow of water thereon in a manner to facilitate flow boarding by riders thereon. The exact shape of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is determined by the shape of the framework and the amount and direction of tension applied to the membrane by the supporting framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Various compliant supports (not shown) and/or pneumatic or hydraulic pressure or vacuum forces may also be applied underneath the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, if desired, to impart a desired shape or compliance characteristic thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the particular embodiment illustrated, the framework <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the amount and direction(s) of tension applied to the membrane ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are substantially fixed or static, subject to only periodic adjustment or modification as may be necessary or desired. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the shape of the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be adjusted dynamically, if desired, by suitably altering or controlling the shape of the supporting frame, applied tension, and/or by adjusting selected pressure or vacuum forces applied underneath the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. For example, dynamically inflatable bladders, adjustable foam supports/rollers and/or other auxiliary support structures (not shown) may be implemented in the illustrated embodiment to provide a dynamically changing ride surface, if desired. These may be controlled hydraulically, pneumatically, mechanically, electrically or otherwise as well-know to those skilled in the art. Such a dynamic ride surface may be advantageous, for example, for competitions wherein different wave shapes and/or wave riding difficulty levels are desired. A dynamic ride surface could also be highly advantageous in providing a challenging wave riding experience providing progressively steeper, random and/or unpredictable changes in the shape of the ride surface during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Of course, the invention disclosed and described herein is not limited to use with simulated surfing wave ride attractions as illustrated and described above. Rather, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the ride surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may, alternatively, be incorporated into or otherwise used in connection with a wide variety of other sliding-type water and/or non-water ride attractions, such as flumes, slides, bowls, half-pipes, parabolic/oscillating slides and/or the like. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that a number of obvious modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from the essential spirit and scope of the invention as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Thus, although the invention has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood that the present invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the present invention herein disclosed should not be limited by the particular disclosed embodiments described above, but should be determined only by a fair reading of the claims that follow. </paragraph>
