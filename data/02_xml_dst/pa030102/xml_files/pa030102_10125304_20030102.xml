<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A stringed instrument has a body, a longitudinal neck attached to the body and extending therefrom, and strings extending between the body and a free head end of the neck, the strings attached so that they generate a tensile force tending to deform the neck. To prevent deformation of the neck, it receives a rigid reinforcing body provided with a groove that extends from a first end of the body and terminates at a distance from the opposite second end, so that the rigid body has a grooveless end region and a grooved end region. The grooved end faces the body of the stringed instrument. The grooveless end region and an upper part of the grooved end region are fixed to the top side of the instrument neck along their entire lengths, whereas a lower part of the grooved end region is detachably secured to the neck and generates a force counteracting the tensile force to minimize the deformation of the neck. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a stringed instrument, and particularly to reinforcing a structure preventing the neck of the stringed instrument from deforming. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A stringed instrument ordinarily has a body, a neck which is joined to the body and a head at the top of the neck, with at least one string and usually a plurality of strings stretched between a bridge on the body and a respective peg nut for each string which is typically on the head. The strings produce a tensile force between the peg nut and the bridge which causes upward deformation of the neck. A bent neck prevents production of correct musical intervals or it becomes difficult to reach the high positions toward the body end of each string, that is the end located close to the body. As the strength of the neck is low, a longer time will be required for the correct intervals to be obtained as the neck part is gradually deformed at the time of tuning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To cope with the above discussed problem, it is known to place a truss rod having a bar-shaped iron core in the neck. This improves the strength of the neck by providing a repulsive force which counteracts forces tending to bend the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another known structure of a stringed instrument has a strong wooden material known as bubinga, which is held at the center of the neck. Alternatively, a metal plate having a convex shape is buried in the neck as a reinforcing material, as described in the Official Publication of Toku Kai 2001 13957. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, however, there has been an increasing demand for reduction of the size and particularly the thickness of the neck, particularly of guitars. This has made it increasingly difficult to place various reinforcing materials and structures, as described above, in the neck of the stringed instrument. Furthermore, the stringed instrument as a whole requires a simple reinforcing structure for the neck. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention has the object of overcoming the above described problems. A reinforcing structure for the neck of a stringed instrument, according to the invention, has an extremely simple structure which provides the neck with high strength and increased resistance to bending forces acting upon the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, the reinforcing structure for the neck of the invention allows bending of the neck to be adjusted and corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the reinforcing structure for the neck of a stringed instrument comprises a longitudinally extending, rigid, preferably plate, bar-shaped body extending along the longitudinal direction of the neck and disposed under a finger plate on the top side of the neck. The bar-shaped body has a cut groove which extends from the instrument body end of the bar shaped body toward the instrument head end of the bar shaped body. The plate bar-shaped body is divided into a head-side grooveless portion, a body-side groove upper portion and a body-side groove lower portion which are separated by the groove. The head-side grooveless portion and the body-side groove upper portion are bound securely along the entire length of the bar-shaped body to the underside of the top side of the neck, and, particularly to the underside of the finger board, and the body-side groove lower portion is detachably secured to the neck only at a location toward the instrument body end, i.e. the open groove end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the reinforcing structure for the neck of a stringed instrument has a plate bar-shaped body which is formed approximately in the form of U as viewed in a plane parallel to the top side of the neck and including a plate bar on the right side and a plate bar on the left side joined by a grooved body end connector. Therefore, the groove extends through the body end connector and into both of the right and left side bars from their instrument body ends toward their instrument head ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a further feature of the invention, the terminal positions of cut grooves formed in the right-side plate bar and left-side plate bar may be the same distance into the bars from their body ends or may be different distances into the bodies from those ends because the different strings across the neck apply different upward bending forces on the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further feature of the invention relates to a reinforcing structure for the neck of a stringed instrument having tensile means that pulls the body-side lower part toward the body of the stringed instrument for generating thereby a force which counteracts tensile forces tending to deform the neck.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An electric guitar <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an example of a stringed instrument in which the invention is provided. The guitar <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending above the top of the body, a head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the end of the neck, a finger plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> applied to the upper side of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to define the top side of the neck, a bridge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the top of the body, peg nuts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the head for each of the strings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the strings extend back to the bridge. For the purpose of illustration, a part of the length of the strings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the finger plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are cut out in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A neck reinforcing structure according to the invention comprises a plate bar-shaped generally rigid body R buried or mounted in and extending along the longitudinal direction of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> below the finger plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the neck. It is able to bend only slightly under tensile forces applied by the strings extending between the bridge and the peg nuts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An example of the plate bar-shaped body R is shown at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is comprised of a material having rigidity with a high Young&apos;s modulus like a metal plate or a carbon fiber material. The body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> cut in from the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, leaving a prescribed ungrooved part toward the head side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> divides the plate bar-shaped body into an instrument head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an instrument body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an instrument body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, both to the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The groove <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may divide the body in half, top and bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are integrally secured to the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the entire length of the body. The body is inside the neck and the securement is to the underside of the top side of the neck, here the underside of the finger board. The stippled indication in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the secured part. The body side terminal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the body side groove lower part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> along its entire length, is securely held to the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the body end of the part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> without being integrally secured to the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along its entire length. There is a screw hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A fixing screw <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is installed in the screw hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. That screw secures the part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is placed under the bottom side of the finger plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the following functions occur. The head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are integrally bound to the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, to function as a strength preservation member for the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tends to bend upward under the tensile strength of the strings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In particular, the head side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>experiences higher bending moments. The integrated part of the head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have high rigidity, as compared with the usually wooden material of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. They are fixed to the upper part of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (that portion which is under the finger plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) at the head side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. As a result, the resistance to bending moments of the upper part of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the head side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that is situated below the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a function which peculiarly reflects the material of the plate bar-shaped body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as it is not integrated with the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tends to bend upward and deforms as shown by arrow a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, forces a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> operate on the head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and on the body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are integrally secured to the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and they deform upward together with the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This produces a force b in the body-side lower part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to extend in the longitudinal direction away from the fixed screw <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which is a fixed part. This force b tends to at least partially compensate for upwardly directed forces a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Since the plate bar-shaped body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is more rigid than the wooden material of the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is no significant elongation of the neck. Rather, the neck supplies force that prevents the forces a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for upward deformation that works on the head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper half part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or as a drag c in a direction which is opposite to that of the force a for upward deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) reinforces because of its material rigidity and also reinforces by supplying a mechanical drag, thereby creating a reinforcing structure for avoiding bending of the neck, using a simple structure offering high strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is now explained. The plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is formed approximately in a U-shape, as viewed in a plane that includes a right-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a left side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> connected by the bent connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the instrument body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. The plane of the body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is parallel to the top side of the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Because the neck of a stringed instrument has some width, the entire neck can have a reinforced structure of higher strength by arranging two plate bar-shaped bodies <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in parallel and extending along the longitudinal direction of the neck. It is possible to arrange two plate bar-shaped bodies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in the example described above independently in parallel. However, it is advantageous from the standpoint of production and assembly to form a single member of U-shape, as viewed in the plane through the bent connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A cut groove <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is formed through the body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending from the bent connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> partially up both legs of the U-shape leaving a prescribed ungrooved part on the head side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>opposite the bent connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. There is a head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the right-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the right side plate bar-shaped body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a body side groove lower part <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the right-side plate bar-shaped body <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the left-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a body-side groove upper part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the left-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the left-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. There is a bent connector groove upper part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a bent connector groove lower part <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the manner described earlier, the head-side grooveless parts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the body-side groove upper parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the bent area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (stippled in the drawing) are secured integrally as one body to the underside of the top side of the neck. The body-side groove lower parts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the bent area <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the body-side terminal bent connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are securely held by the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without being integrally secured to the neck. A cam <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (described below) serves as a fixing member. The functions of the above described parts of the body <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are the same as those described earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates another modification of a body R (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A). The terminal positions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the cut grooves <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>A of the right-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the left-side plate bar-shaped part <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are at different positions along their parts of the body from their head-sides <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. Strings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on a stringed instrument are thick on the lower pitch sound side, and thinner on the higher pitch sound side, so that the tensile forces applied by the strings are different between the right and left sides across the guitar.

At the body-side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>terminal <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a square-shaped cam mounting part <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed. It receives an eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that serves as a fixing member when installed in the cam mounting part <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in a freely rotatable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a large-diameter generally arcuate region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a small-diameter generally arcuate region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as shown in expanded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The cam is installed integrally on an installation member <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> through an installation hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is rectangular in shape. The difference between the large diameter region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the small-diameter region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the example may be one millimeter. The installation member is in turn attached to the side wall of the recess in the neck that receives the body R (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). If the installation member <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is rotated e.g., by a wrench (not shown), etc., which rotates the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a prescribed angle, the large-diameter part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>presses on the cam-receiving member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and pulls the body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> toward the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>acting through the cam mount <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. A fixing nut <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> tightens the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the installation member <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> ordinarily functions as a fixing part on the body-side groove lower half part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. When the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is operated in the manner described above, the body-side groove lower part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) may be pulled toward the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The tensile force applied by the tensile means P produces a drag force c in the plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) as described earlier and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and is a force that counters other forces that would tend to deform the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the head-side grooveless part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper half part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> integrally secured with the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the instrument.

It is installed integrally on the installation member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> at a rectangular installation hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As described earlier, when the installation member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is rotated, its large-diameter region <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>presses the cam-receiving member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and pulls the body-side groove lower parts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> toward the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>through the bent connector of the groove lower part <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>.

The installation member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> passes through the bottom of the guitar neck and secures the cam there. The eccentric cam <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> functions as a fixing member in ordinary cases. As the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is operated, it pulls on the body-side groove lower parts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the plate bar-shaped body R (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A) in the direction toward the body side <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>. As a result, the force that tends to deform the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upward is prevented through the head-side grooveless parts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the body-side groove upper parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that have been secured on the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the guitar. Should an inevitable bend be produced in the neck <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it could be corrected and adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thus, the reinforcing structure for the neck of a stringed instrument in this invention, which has been explained above, makes it possible to achieve the reinforcement using a material having rigidity and from the standpoint of a drag in terms of dynamics by using an extremely simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art.
