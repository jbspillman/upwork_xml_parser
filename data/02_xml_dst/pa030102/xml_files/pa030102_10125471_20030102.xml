<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a music delivery system for delivering music data, karaoke data and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-114473 (1997) and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-36795 have described a system in which a delivery server stores music data, karaoke data (accompaniment music data and lyrics data) and the like and data to be desired are delivered when a request is given from a terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In some cases in which a singer sings a theme with lyrics to accompaniment, a sale of the tune is influenced depending on the contents of the lyrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of lyrics. In lyrics LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo; is a name of one of cities in Japan and &ldquo;Hisaya Main Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sakae&rdquo; are names of a famous park and a downtown in the &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, the lyrics LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have names of specific places such as A. &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, B. &ldquo;Hisaya Main Street&rdquo; and C. &ldquo;Sakae&rdquo;. In the case of the lyrics having the names of the places, a tune having the lyrics might be well received by listeners who live in the same places. However, it is supposed that the tune is not well received by listeners who live in other places because the included names of places are unfamiliar to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As described above, the sale of a music having the lyrics is varied depending on how much listeners gain sympathy with the contents of the lyrics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a music delivery system capable of delivering a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention is directed to a music delivery system. The music delivery system includes a delivery server for storing at least one of musical accompaniment data and lyrics data of a plurality of tunes including at least one of a musical accompaniment and lyrics and for delivering the data on request, and a receiving terminal for giving a request for delivering at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data to the delivery server and receiving the delivery upon receipt of an instruction from a user. A part of or all of at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data are constituted by a change data block which can be changed and at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data can be thereby changed at the delivery server or the receiving terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a part or all of at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data are constituted by the change data block which can be changed and at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data can be thereby changed at the delivery server or the receiving terminal. For example, accordingly, the portion of the name of the place in the lyrics data can be constituted by the change data block to change and deliver the lyrics data according to a birth place of each user or the like. Thus, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of providing a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. Moreover, in the case in which one tune has a plurality of variations, it is sufficient that data on a changed portion are stored as a selection choice of the change data block in addition to a common portion between the variations. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a storage volume in the delivery server as compared with the case in which the tune is stored as an individual tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Each data of the change data block are stored in relation to the terminal location information in each of the storage means. For example, in the case of the change table TB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the change portion A is the change data block and is also information related to the terminal location information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The control means CT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> searches the information related to the lyrics data which correspond to the terminal location information obtained from the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the corresponding change data block is incorporated into the lyrics data in other common portions to be delivered to the receiving terminal together with the musical accompaniment data. For example, in the case in which the terminal location information is &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hisaya Main Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sakae&rdquo; are incorporated in each of the portions A to C of the lyrics data respectively and are then delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thus, if one tune has a plurality of variations and data on a change portion are to be stored as a selection choice of the change data block in addition to common portions between the variations, the storage volume of the lyrics data in the delivery server can be reduced as compared with the case in which each variation is stored as an individual tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control means CT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputs the delivered musical accompaniment data and lyrics data (voice data and text data) to the music output section MU and the video display section IM respectively by utilizing sound source data in the sound source data storage means SRD if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As described above, the change data block is changed depending on the position of presence of the receiving terminal for the delivery destination. A tune to be stored in the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may include a so&mdash;called instrumental tune having no lyrics data but only musical accompaniment data. In that case, the lyrics data cannot be set to the change data block. For example, therefore, it is preferable that a portion or plural portions constituting the musical accompaniment data should be instead changed into data as a change data block which can be changed and the same portion should be varied depending on the position of presence of the receiving terminal for the delivery destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As a specific example in which the musical accompaniment data are to be changed, in the case in which the musical accompaniment data are constituted by the MIDI data, it is preferable that a certain track should be set to the change data block and a track to be delivered should be varied depending on the position of presence of the receiving terminal. In the MIDI standard, musical performance data for 16 channels at a maximum can be recorded and a track of the musical performance data can be assigned to an optional channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case in which the musical accompaniment data are to be delivered to Okinawa (the name of one of cities in Japan), a track of musical performance data having a tone set to a &ldquo;jabisen (snake-skin samisen : a plucked instrument peculiar to Okinawa)&rdquo; is delivered. In the case in which the musical accompaniment data are to be delivered to other places in Japan, the same track is delivered with musical performance data having a tone set to a &ldquo;samisen (a plucked instrument often used in places other than Okinawa in Japan).&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the music delivery system in accordance with the present embodiment, a part or all of at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data are constituted by the change data block which can be changed. Consequently, it is. possible to change at least one of the musical accompaniment data and the lyrics data in the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the lyrics data can be changed and delivered depending on the position of presence of the receiving terminal to be operated by each user. Accordingly, the place name portion in the lyrics data can be constituted by the change data block, thereby changing and delivering the lyrics data depending on the position of presence of the receiving terminal. Thus, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of providing a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. Moreover, in the case in which one tune has a plurality of variations, the data for a change portion are stored as the selection choice of the change data block in addition to the common portions between the variations. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the storage volume in the delivery server as compared with the case in which the tune is stored as an individual tune. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the first embodiment. Lyrics include a portion related to an attribute or taste of a user. In the case in which the portion related to the attribute or taste is a change data block, a delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes a selection choice of the change data block of lyrics data based on user information about the attribute or taste of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the change data block is stored in relation to terminal location information. In the present embodiment, however, each selection choice of the change data block is related to a keyword in user information related to the attribute or taste of the user and the change data block is changed based on the user information which is previously obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of related information for causing the user information to correspond to the change data block. In related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, information about a birth place of a user is employed for a keyword D and information about a favorite food of the user is employed for a keyword E. In the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;Aichi Ken&rdquo; indicates a name of a prefecture where &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo; is present, &ldquo;Fukuoka Ken&rdquo; indicates the name of a prefecture where &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo; is present, and &ldquo;Hokkaido&rdquo; indicates the name of a prefecture where &ldquo;Sapporo&rdquo; is present. In the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, moreover, &ldquo;Uiroh&rdquo; indicates a name of a special food in the &ldquo;Aichi Ken&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mentaiko&rdquo; indicates the name of the special food in the &ldquo;Fukuoka Ken&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ishikarinabe&rdquo; indicates the name of the special food in the &ldquo;Hokkaido&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of user information to be input to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As an example of the user information, a questionnaire QN answered about the attribute or taste of the user is employed. In the questionnaire QN, &ldquo;name&rdquo;, &ldquo;address&rdquo;, &ldquo;birth place&rdquo;, &ldquo;access point&rdquo;, &ldquo;favorite food&rdquo;, &ldquo;favorite sports&rdquo; and &ldquo;frequently seen Web site&rdquo; are examples of a keyword indicative of the attribute and taste of the user, respectively. The &ldquo;access point&rdquo; indicates an access point to be used for connecting the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a network NT such as internet and the &ldquo;frequently seen Web site&rdquo; indicates URL (Uniform Resource Locater) which the user often visits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, when the user utilizes the music delivery system according to the present embodiment, a manager of the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> previously gives the user a request for answering the questionnaire QN. The questionnaire QN answered by the user is given to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the network NT. The delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores the transmitted questionnaire QN in accessor attribute storage means ATD such that the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can refer thereto when the user accesses to the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When a request for delivering a music is given from the user, information about a birth place of the user is extracted as a keyword from the questionnaire QN, for example, and the information about the birth place is compared with the keyword D in the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to retrieve a coincidence. For example, if the birth place of the user is the &ldquo;Aichi Ken&rdquo;, {circle over (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)} is selected as lyrics data, that is, a selection choice of a change data block in the {circle over (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)} in the change table TB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is selected to deliver the lyrics data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> together with musical accompaniment data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As a matter of course, a plurality of items in the questionnaire QN may be extracted and compared with a plurality of keywords in the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to select a change data block having the largest number of coincidences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to the music delivery system in accordance with the present embodiment, thus, the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes a change data block in the lyrics data based on the user information. Accordingly, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of changing and delivering the lyrics data depending on the attribute or taste of each user and of providing a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to the music delivery system in accordance with the present embodiment, moreover, the keyword is related to the selection choice of the change data block and the selection choice of the change data block is selected based on the selected keyword. Accordingly, each user can easily give the user information to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can readily select the selection choice of the change data block from the selected keyword. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Third Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is also a variant of the music delivery system according to the first embodiment. In the present embodiment, a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not utilized as a domestic information terminal but a karaoke information terminal to be installed in a store for a person doing a karaoke business (a service business for providing only a musical accompaniment for a tune originally having lyrics to cause a user to sing). More specifically, the first embodiment is applied to a communication karaoke delivery system for delivering karaoke data on a new tune through a communication line to each receiving terminal installed in a store of a karaoke manager (which is generally referred to as a &ldquo;karaoke box&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A method of delivering a music when utilizing the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the karaoke information terminal to be installed in a store is basically the same as that in the first embodiment and is different in that the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> does not require a delivery of voice data as lyrics data. Also in this case, therefore, when &ldquo;Woman in &xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; (which is a tune shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and has the contents of a change data block in &ldquo;&xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo;) is requested at a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the karaoke box in &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is delivered from the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Similarly, in the case in which the &ldquo;Woman in &xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; is requested at a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the karaoke box in &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo;, &ldquo;Woman in Hakata&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is delivered from the delivery service <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In each of the receiving terminals <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a portion of &ldquo;&xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; may be shown in a blank for a karaoke user, or, &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fukuoka&rdquo; and the like may be notated in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The user information may include an access record obtained when the user accessed the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the past. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case in which the user utilizes the karaoke box in each of the &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo; and the number of uses in the &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo; is larger than that in the &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo;, the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores the record for a past access place in accessor attribute storage means ATD to select a change data.block selection choice in a place where the number of accesses is large. Also in the case in which the user utilizes the karaoke box in the &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo;, consequently, the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; can also be delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of changing a change data block according to a place where the user accesses the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so many times and of providing a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Fourth Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the third embodiment. While a change data block is changed depending on the position of presence of a receiving terminal in the third embodiment, the change data block is changed by reflecting an attribute or taste of a karaoke user. More specifically, the karaoke user can give user information to a delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by utilizing a personal information terminal such as his (her) own mobile telephone or PDA (Personal Digital Assistance), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example, it is possible to implement such a structure that a karaoke user can store the questionnaire QN of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in a self-personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and can send information about the questionnaire QN to a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a karaoke box BX, thereby transmitting the information about the questionnaire QN to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a network NT. Alternatively, access may be directly given from the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the network NT to transmit the information about the questionnaire QN to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Moreover, storage means (not shown) may be provided on the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to store the information about the questionnaire QN therein and to transmit the same information to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In addition, a personal information database (for example, a telephone book database in a telephone station or the like) PID capable of accessing the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the network NT may store the information about the questionnaire QN and may transmit the same information to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under control of the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With such a structure that the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, other external storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or PID stores the user information therein and the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> refers to the same information, thus, it is not necessary for the user to answer the questionnaire every time the user information is given to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user is not burdened with information input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With such a structure that the user information is given to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the operation of the personal information terminal owned by the user, moreover, each user can also use his (her) own personal information terminal as a remote control for operating the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes a structure of the personal information terminal. The personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has accessor attribute data storage means AAD for storing user information, an input/output interface IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for externally exchanging information, input means IN such as a keyboard for inputting the user information, a display section DP for displaying the input information and control means CT<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such as a CPU for controlling each of the portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the case in which the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to exchange information with the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an input/output interface IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(for example, an interface based on the bluetooth technique) is preferably provided on the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the leakage of a privacy in the. exchange of the user information, the user information is preferably enciphered and given to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the user information is preferably enciphered and transmitted by the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technique, for example. Thus, the user information can be protected. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Fifth Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the fourth embodiment. In such a music delivery system, a user can indicate the contents of change of a change data block to change musical accompaniment data or lyrics data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For example, the portion &ldquo;B.&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be constituted to be changed into another keyword such as B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, items of &ldquo;Nagoya Dome&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fukuoka Dome&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sapporo Dome&rdquo; are names of a famous baseball field in &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sapporo&rdquo;, respectively. In the B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, items of &ldquo;Mizuho Ground&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hakata-no-Mori Ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sapporo Atsubetsu Park Sports Stadium&rdquo; are names of a famous soccer stadium in the &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Hakata&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sapporo&rdquo;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In this case, the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> prepares a selection choice such as B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the user can select the selection choice from a self-personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user may store the contents to be changed in the self-personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and may transmit the contents of change to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby changing musical accompaniment data or lyrics data to be delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In that case, preferably, the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with parody data storage means VSD such that the user can previously store musical accompaniment data and/or lyrics data to be changed and can transmit the same data to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case in which the lyrics of &ldquo;Woman in &xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are to be changed into &ldquo;Woman in Kyoto&rdquo; as shown in a changed portion VAR of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the parody data storage means VSD is caused to store data on a change of &ldquo;B.&rdquo; in the lyrics data into &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; and to transmit the same data to the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> If the user can thus change a change data block into favorite contents, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of providing a music with which each listener can gain sympathy more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the case in which a user is to sing, in a karaoke box, a tune which is not stored in the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the user may previously acquire lyrics data and musical accompaniment data on the tune by himself (herself) (for example, the musical accompaniment data are downloaded from his (her) own CD to the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), thereby uploading the same data to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Sixth Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the fifth embodiment, in which a change data block of lyrics data is changed while referring to an indication of the contents of change of the change data block carried out in the past by another user having an attribute or taste coincident with that of an accessing user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In general, it is apparent that another person having the same taste often carries out same selection to be desired. Accordingly, if the same change is carried out for a current accessing user with-reference to the contents of change of the change data block which was performed in the past by another user having an attribute or taste coincident with that of the accessing user, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of providing a music with which the accessing user can easily gain sympathy because the attribute or taste is supposed to be similar or close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> For example, assuming that another user gives &ldquo;baseball&rdquo; as &ldquo;favorite sports&rdquo; in the questionnaire of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and selects, as a selection choice, B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is supposed that the contents of change of the change data block may be B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> if a current accessing user gives the &ldquo;baseball&rdquo; as the &ldquo;favorite sports&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Such a processing can easily be implemented by causing control means CT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to change a change data block while referring to user information about an accessing user and user information about another user which is stored in accessor attribute storage means ATO. It is preferable that the user information of each user should be stored as a database in the accessor attribute storage means ATO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an example of the flow. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, first of all, the control means CT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> detects the contents of an answer for a specific item related to a taste, for example, in the contents of a questionnaire for an accessor as shown in Step S<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>. As shown in Step S<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight>, next, the control means CT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> retrieves and selects lyrics selected by a large number of other accessors having the same answer contents in the past while referring to information in the accessor attribute storage means ATO. As shown in Step S<highlight><bold>03</bold></highlight>, then, the control means CT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivers data on the selected lyrics to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Seventh Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the third to sixth embodiments, in which the contents of a background video to be displayed at a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are changed based on the change of a change data block in addition to the change of a tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided in a karaoke box, a background video is generally displayed together with lyrics telop. In the present embodiment, the background video to be displayed is also changed based on the change of the change data block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> back video database BVD storing a large number of background videos is provided in the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If a keyword in the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is related to each background video, a proper background video corresponding to lyrics or a musical accompaniment can be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the related information TB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for example, in the case in which &ldquo;Aichi Ken&rdquo; is included as an attribute of an accessor, it is preferable that a video of the &ldquo;Aichi Ken&rdquo; should be displayed as the background video. Consequently, it is possible to implement a music delivery system capable of providing, together with a video, a music with which each listener can easily gain sympathy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Eighth Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of a music delivery system according to the first to seventh embodiments, in which the number of tune deliveries is totalized as the total number of deliveries, and furthermore, the number of tune deliveries is totalized as the number of deliveries according to a type for each type of change of a change data block and the total number of deliveries and the number of deliveries according to the type are delivered to a receiving terminal or the total number of deliveries is delivered, to the receiving terminal, as a result of totalization for one of the types of the change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A user to desire the delivery of a music including karaoke is generally interested in which tune is popular and tends to listen to or sing the popular tune. Accordingly, the user is often informed of the number of deliveries of the tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the user is informed of the number of deliveries of a tune for each type of change of a change data block as the number of deliveries according to a type so that the user is caused to recognize which change type is popular. Alternatively, the user is informed of the total number of deliveries as a result of totalization for one of the types of the change so that the user is caused to recognize that a specific change type is popular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivers, to a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a result of totalization of the total number of deliveries for a tune of lyrics LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, the details can be expressed for each type of the change of a change data block as a method of giving a notice of the result of totalization (that is, &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; of 100000 times, &ldquo;Woman in Hakata&rdquo; of 30000 times and &ldquo;Woman in Sapporo&rdquo; of 10000 times can be expressed). That is, the user can be informed of the number of tune deliveries as the number of deliveries according to a type. On the other hand, the user can also be informed of the total number of deliveries of 150000 times for the tune having the lyrics LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a result of totalization for one type of &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; at the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;Nagoya&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the former case, the user can be caused to recognize which change type is popular, thereby increasing the number of deliveries of the whole tune or increasing the number of deliveries of a tune subjected to some type of change (for example, the number of deliveries of the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; having a large number of deliveries can be more increased). In the latter case, moreover, it is possible to increase the number of tune deliveries by causing the user to have such a recognition that a specific change type is popular (that is, the number of deliveries of the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo; can be seen to be larger than the number of actual deliveries). For example, consequently, the number of deliveries of the whole tune can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In order to carry out such totalization, it is preferable that the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> should be provided with chart totalization result storage means HCD for storing each totalization result and delivering the result to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As a totalizing method, in the case in which the manager of the server wants to let the user recognize that a specific change type is popular, totalization data to be stored in the chart totalization result storage means HCD are incremented every time &ldquo;Woman in &xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; is selected as shown in Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and a current totalization result is delivered to be a totalization result of a specific change type (for example, one type of totalization result of the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo;) as shown in Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case in which the details are expressed to cause the user to recognize which change type is popular, totalization data to be stored in the chart totalization result storage means HCD are incremented every time &ldquo;Woman in &xcirc;&xcirc;&rdquo; is selected as shown in Step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and a current totalization result is delivered to be a totalization result of the total number of deliveries and an individual totalization result as shown in Step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Ninth Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is a variant of the music delivery system according to the first to seventh embodiments, in which musical accompaniment data and lyrics data are constituted by a plurality of tracks, each of the tracks is regarded as a change data block and a delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serves to carry out a delivery on a unit of one track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case in which the musical accompaniment data are MIDI data, musical accompaniment data CP can be constituted as tracks TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> according to a tone of an instrument (for example, TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a track of a drum, TR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a track of a bass and TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a track of a piano) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Moreover, the lyrics data LY can also be stored as tracks TR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to TR<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> according to the type of the change data block (for example, each of &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Woman in Hakata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Woman in Sapporo&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In this case, for example, it is possible to carry out a delivery for each track to a user. For example, the tracks TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to TR<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be delivered to a user to desire the &ldquo;Woman in Nagoya&rdquo;, and the tracks TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and TR<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be delivered to a user to desire the &ldquo;Woman in Hakata&rdquo;. In addition, for example, only the track TR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can also be delivered to a user to require only the track of the piano. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Thus, the user can desire the delivery of only a necessary track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferable that accounting for a delivery should be carried out according to the number of the tracks to be delivered. Consequently, it is also possible to experimentally deliver only one track and to pay a value to require the delivery of all the tracks only when the user likes it, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating the foregoing, in which the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> delivers a part of the tracks to a receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> free, for example. In the case in which a user receiving the tracks likes the tune and desires the delivery of all the tracks, he (she) pays money to a banking agency Fl previously specified by a manager of the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a method such as electronic settlement. After the delivery server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> confirms the payment, the user delivers all the purchased tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Thus, the user can connect a personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (for example, a synthesizer is illustrated) to the receiving terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for example, thereby downloading data on each track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In this case, for example, the user can receive only the track TR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the drum free and can make residual tracks by himself (herself) or the user can purchase all the tracks to enjoy the reproduction of a tune through the personal information terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, a flexible delivery can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
