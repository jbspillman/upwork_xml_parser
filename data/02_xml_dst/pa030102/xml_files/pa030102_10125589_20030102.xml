<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent applications No. 2001-127816 and No. 2001-127830 which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a zoom lens system having a high zoom ratio, a light weight, compactness and good cost performance and, in particular, to a compact standard zoom lens system having a high zoom ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a so-called standard zoom lens with a zoom ratio of 3 to 4 including a wide-angle end state has steadily become smaller its dimension and lower the manufacturing cost. Since the lens system is mounted on the camera body as the regularly used lens, it is essential to have compactness, lightweight, satisfactory imaging performance, and reasonable manufacturing cost. In order to satisfy the above-described requirements, it is necessary for each lens group to have strong refractive power and to be thinner as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, zoom lens systems having four lens groups of positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement from the object side have been proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 1-229217, 8-248319, 9-101459, 2000-075204, 2000-187161, 7-113957, 2000-338401. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the zoom lens systems disclosed in the above-mentioned publications mainly have the zoom ratio of about 3 to 4. Even the zoom lens system having a high zoom ratio has been large in dimension, has a large number of elements. In addition, the optical performance has not been satisfactory. Accordingly, a compact zoom lens system, as the present invention, being downsized ultimately having a zoom ratio of more than 6.62, which corresponds to 28 mm to 200 mm in the 35 mm film format, has not been existed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Conventional design policy for a 28 to 200 mm zoom lens has adopted the design that power of each lens group is increased, and the number of lens elements is also increased so as to correct aberrations. However, this design policy brings an increase of weight because each lens group becomes thick resulting from the additional number of lens elements. Moreover, dead space between adjacent lens groups decreases, so that it tends to become large. Therefore, it is necessary for further downsizing to adopt completely different designing policy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention introduces a new design method that eliminates useless lens elements and minimizes the number of elements consisting of each lens group. Using this effect makes it possible to miniaturize the zoom lens system by making each lens group thin without setting forcible power arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is particularly important for the first embodiment that a rear lens group (master lens group), which is the rear lens group of a positive-lens-leading zoom lens represented typically by four unit zoom lenses having positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement, consists only of two lens elements composed of a positive element and a negative element, which are the minimum number of lens elements for correcting chromatic aberration and other aberrations. This construction is a basic construction of a telephoto type. The construction of the embodiment is essential condition to make the rear (master) lens group extremely thinner and to make the back focal length shorter. This construction has made it possible to realize minimizing elements such as the size of the filter, the diameter of the lens system, and the total lens length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the present invention will be explained below in accordance with each conditional expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (1) defines the total lens length, excluding the back focal length from the optical lens length, of the zoom lens system normalized by the focal length of the zoom lens system in a telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the ratio &Sgr;dw/ft exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (1), the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes too thick. As a result, the compactness that is the purpose of the present invention cannot be accomplished by the lens construction according to the present invention. Moreover, the weight including the lens barrel becomes heavier and the cost of the material also increases, so that it becomes unattractive as a common, high-zoom-ratio zoom lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression (1) is set to be less than 0.50, a common, high-zoom-ratio zoom lens can be realized with lower manufacturing cost. Moreover, when the upper limit of conditional expression (1) is set to be less than 0.47, a common high-zoom-ratio zoom lens can be realized with even lower manufacturing cost. When the upper limit of conditional expression (1) is set to be less than 0.45, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (1), the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes extremely narrow. As a result, the back focal length becomes short, so that the zoom lens system cannot be virtually used as an interchangeable lens of a single lens reflex camera. Since each lens group is necessary to have extremely strong power, correction of aberration becomes difficult. As a result, it becomes impossible to make the zoom ratio high, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (1) is set to be more than 0.20, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (2) defines the focal length of the first lens group normalized by that of the zoom lens system in the telephoto end state. To optimize the focal length of the first lens group is important condition for realizing a good aberration correction and for settling the length of the zoom lens system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When the ratio f1/ft exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (2), it means the power of the first lens group becomes weak, so that the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes large. This is undesirable. Moreover, in a high-zoom-ratio zoom lens system like the present invention, the total lens length varies drastically in the telephoto state, so that it becomes difficult to carve a curve for a cam on a lens barrel. It becomes impossible to realize the zoom lens system. In the case with extremely fewer lens elements like the present invention, it becomes more important to set optimum Petzval summation. When the power of the first lens group is decreased, Petzval summation becomes smaller, so that it becomes difficult to correct curvature of field and astigmatism. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression (2) is set to be less than 0.50, it becomes possible to set better Petzval summation. Moreover, when the upper limit of conditional expression (2) is set to be less than 0.48, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (2), it means refractive power of the first lens group becomes extremely large. The increase of refractive power of the first lens group has the effect that the light ray entered to the front lens at large angle of view is further lowered to the periphery of the lens. Therefore, light quantity in the periphery of the field decreases. As a result, the diameter of the front lens and that of the filter become large, so that it is undesirable. Moreover, in the correction of aberration, peripheral coma in the wide-angle state and spherical aberration in the telephoto state become worse, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (2) is set to be more than 0.30, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (3) defines absolute value of the focal length of the second lens group normalized by the focal length of the zoom lens system in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When the ratio &verbar;f2&verbar;/ft exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (3), it means negative refractive power of the second lens group becomes weak. In this case, the moving amount of the second lens group becomes large, so that the zoom lens system becomes large. Moreover, the light ray entered to the front lens at large angle of view is further lowered to the periphery of the lens. Therefore, light quantity in the periphery of the field decreases. As a result, the diameter of the front lens and that of the filter become large, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression is set to be less than 0.10, the lens system can be more compact. When the upper limit of conditional expression is set to be less than 0.085, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (3), it means refractive power of the second lens group becomes extremely strong. In this case, Petzval summation becomes smaller than the appropriate value, so that it becomes difficult to correct curvature of field and astigmatism. This is undesirable. Moreover, off-axis aberrations as well as distortion in the wide-angel end state become difficult to correct, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is desirable that either the positive lens component Ll or the negative lens component L2 in the lens group Gm has at least one aspherical surface. When the lens group Gm is constructed to be extremely narrow and to be constructed by the minimum number of lens elements capable of correcting chromatic and other aberrations, in order to exhibit maximum performance of the present invention, it is particularly desirable that correction of aberrations is carried out by introducing aspherical surfaces. In a high-zoom-ratio zoom lens system like the present invention, it is very important point for compactness and high optical performance to correct spherical aberration in the telephoto state and upper coma by introducing aspherical surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in order to exhibit maximum performance of the present invention, it is desirable that the zoom lens system has basic construction of a four unit zoom lens having positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement so as to balance compactness with high optical performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (4) defines an appropriate amount of the distance between the two lens elements of the lens group Gm. When the lens elements are constructed by a positive element and a negative element as the present invention, the air distance controls the principal points of the lens group as a whole, securing the dead space with respect to the lens group locating directly before, setting the back focal length at an appropriate value, accomplishing both compactness and a high zoom ratio, keeping refractive powers of both lens elements, and realizing good aberration correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When the ratio dpn/dm exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (4), the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes large and the back focal length becomes short, so that they are undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (4), it means refractive power of both lens elements becomes strong. In this case, correction of various aberrations as well as spherical aberration both in the wide-angle end state and in the telephoto end state becomes worse, so that it is undesirable. Moreover, as a matter of manufacturing, a portion of lens elements having an extremely fine decentering tolerance comes out, so that it becomes difficult to manufacture. This is undesirable. In addition, the image side surface of the most image side lens becomes extremely concave to the image. Accordingly, unless otherwise accomplished an extremely long back focal length relative to the normal one, the zoom lens system causes mechanical interference with a so-called quick return mirror of a single lens reflex camera, so that it cannot be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (4) is set to be more than 0.30, various aberrations such as spherical aberration can be corrected well. Moreover, when the lower limit of conditional expression (4) is set to be more than 0.58, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable that the aforementioned at least one lens group is composed only of a third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power and that the following conditional expression (5) is satisfied: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>0.2<highlight><italic>&lt;f</italic></highlight>3/fm&lt;1.0&emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> where f3 denotes the focal length of the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and fm denotes the focal length of the lens group Gm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (5) defines the power ratio of the third lens group to the fourth lens group. In order to correct various aberrations, it is necessary that refractive power of the third lens group is stronger than that of the fourth lens group. It is desirable that the ratio satisfies the condition for correcting particularly spherical aberration in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When the ratio exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (5), it means the power of the fourth lens group becomes stronger than that of the third lens group. In this case, spherical aberration and coma in the telephoto state becomes extremely worse, so that a compact, high-zoom-ratio zoom lens system as the present invention cannot be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression (5) is set to be less than 0.8, various aberrations such as spherical aberration can be corrected well. In addition, when the upper limit of conditional expression is set to be less than 0.6, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (5), it means the power of the third lens group becomes stronger than that of the fourth lens group. In this case, various aberrations as well as spherical aberration in both wide-angle state and telephoto state become worse. This is undesirable. Moreover, as a matter of manufacturing, a portion of lens elements having an extremely fine decentering tolerance comes out, so that it becomes difficult to manufacture. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (5) is set to be more than 0.3, various aberrations such as spherical aberration can be corrected well. In addition, when the lower limit of conditional expression (5) is set to be more than 0.35, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Then, aspherical surfaces introduced in the present invention are explained. In order to exhibit the maximum optical performance of the present invention, it is desirable that at least one aspherical surface is arranged in each of positive lens component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lens group Gm, wherein the aspherical surface has a shape that positive refractive power of the single lens element becomes weak or negative refractive power of the single lens element becomes strong as the height goes from the optical axis to the periphery of the lens element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> This technique is quite effective for a compact zoom lens system having a high zoom ratio such as the present invention. As described above, in the present invention that the lens group Gm is made to be extremely narrow and is constructed by the minimum number of elements for correcting chromatic and other aberrations, by introducing aspherical surfaces into both positive lens component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, degree of freedom for designing can be obtained such that various off-axis aberrations such as coma as well as spherical aberration are corrected well and that the back focal length and dead spaces between respective lens groups are arranged ideally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The shape that positive refractive power of the single lens element becomes weak or negative refractive power of the single lens element becomes strong as the height goes from the optical axis to the periphery of the lens element is capable to correct negative spherical aberration well. This is for correcting spherical aberration of the lens group Gm itself well and, as a result, it makes it possible to cope with a lens system having small f-number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In order to exhibit the maximum optical performance of the present invention, it is desirable that the positive lens component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the lens group Gm is constructed by double aspherical surfaces and that the image side aspherical surface of the double aspherical lens has a shape that the curvature in the periphery of the effective aperture becomes larger than that on the optical axis. As described above, this is for correcting spherical aberration of the lens group Gm itself well and for enhancing the effect to correct various off-axis aberrations. Because both aspherical surfaces are separated with each other by the thickness of the lens, the each aspherical surface has different height and angle of deviation with respect to each incident ray. By using the different height and angle of deviation for designing each aspherical surface, a plurality of aberrations can be corrected at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is desirable that the negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lens group Gm has at least one aspherical surface, wherein the aspherical surface has a shape that the negative refractive power in the most peripheral part of the effective aperture becomes stronger than that on the optical axis. This is mainly effective to correct off-axis aberration such as curvature of field in the wide-angle end state and coma in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is desirable for the present invention that the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has at least one negative lens element and at least one positive lens element, and the following conditional expressions (6) and (7) are satisfied: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>np&lt;1.85&emsp;&emsp;(6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Vp&lt;27&emsp;&emsp;(7) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> where np denotes refractive index of the positive lens element at d-line and Vp denotes Abbe number of the positive lens element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Conditional expressions (6) and (7) define an appropriate range of the glass material of the positive lens element of the second lens group. Conditional expression (6) defines appropriate value of refractive index at the d-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When the value exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (6), the positive refractive power becomes excessively strong, so that if the second lens group is used with relatively strong power, it becomes difficult to settle Petzval summation in the optimum value. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the upper limit of conditional expression (6) is set to be less than 1.84 or 1.83, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (7) defines an appropriate value of Abbe number. When the value exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (7), variations of axial chromatic aberration and lateral chromatic aberration upon zooming cannot be corrected well, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Examples according to the first embodiment of the present invention are going to be explained below with reference to accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In respective graphs, FNO denotes the f-number, Y denotes an image height, and d, g denote aberration curves at d-line and g-line, respectively. In the graphs showing spherical aberration, the value of FNO is the f-number with respect to the maximum aperture. In the graphs showing astigmatism and distortion, the value of Y denotes the maximum image height. In the graphs showing coma, the value of Y denotes an image height for each image. In the graphs showing astigmatism, a solid line indicates a sagittal image plane, and a broken line indicates a meridional image plane. In all aberration graphs of the following examples, the same denotations are applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the respective graphs showing various aberrations, excellent compensation is made for various aberrations up to large angle of view in the wide-angle end state, in the intermediate focal length state, and in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the lens arrangement of a zoom lens system according to Example 2 of the first embodiment of the present invention, together with the movement of each lens group during zooming. A zoom lens system according to Example 2 of the first embodiment is composed of four lens groups having positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement. The zoom lens system consists of, in order from an object, a first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power, a second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having negative refractive power, a third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power, and a fourth lens group Gm having positive refractive power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, a cemented positive lens L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constructed by a negative meniscus lens having a convex surface facing to the object side cemented with a positive lens, and a positive meniscus lens L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a convex surface facing to the object side. The second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, a negative meniscus composite lens L<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> composed of glass and resin materials having an aspherical surface facing to the object side, a double concave negative lens L<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a double concave negative lens L<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, an aperture stop S, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a double concave negative lens L<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The fourth lens group Gm consists of, in order from the object, a positive lens L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having an aspherical surface on both sides, and a negative lens L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an aspherical surface facing to the object side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When the state of lens group positions is changed from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, all lens groups are moved independently such that the space between the first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, the space between the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> decreases, and the space between the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the fourth lens group Gm decreases. The focusing from the infinity to a closer object is carried out by moving the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the object side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Various values associated with Example 2 are listed in Table 2.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the lens arrangement of a zoom lens system according to Example 3 of the first embodiment of the present invention, together with the movement of each lens group during zooming. A zoom lens system according to Example 3 of the first embodiment is composed of four lens groups having positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement. The zoom lens system consists of, in order from an object, a first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power, a second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having negative refractive power, a third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power, and a fourth lens group Gm having positive refractive power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, a cemented positive lens L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constructed by a negative meniscus lens having a convex surface facing to the object side cemented with a positive lens, and a positive meniscus lens L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a convex surface facing to the object side. The second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, a negative meniscus composite lens L<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> composed of glass and resin materials having an aspherical surface facing to the object side, a double concave negative lens L<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a double concave negative lens L<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of, in order from the object, an aperture stop S, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a cemented positive lens L<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> constructed by a double convex positive lens cemented with a double concave negative lens. The fourth lens group Gm consists of, in order from the object, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having aspherical surfaces on both sides, and a negative lens L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an aspherical surface facing to the object side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the state of lens group positions is changed from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, all lens groups are moved independently such that the space between the first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, the space between the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> decreases, and the space between the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the fourth lens group Gm decreases. The focusing from the infinity to a closer object is carried out by moving the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the object side. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 11</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> graphically show various aberrations of the zoom lens system according to Example 3 of the first embodiment in a wide-angle end state, an intermediate focal length state, and a telephoto end state, respectively when the system is focused at infinity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the respective graphs showing various aberrations, excellent compensation is made for various aberrations up to large angle of view in the wide-angle end state, in the intermediate focal length state, and in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> It is particularly important for the second embodiment of the present invention that a rear lens group (master lens group), which is the rear lens group of a positive-lens-leading zoom lens represented typically by four unit zoom lenses having positive-negative-positive-positive arrangement, consists of the minimum number of lens elements for correcting chromatic aberration and other aberrations. This construction is a basic construction of a telephoto type. The construction of the embodiment is essential condition to make the rear (master) lens group extremely thinner and to make the back focal length shorter. This construction makes it possible to realize minimizing the size of the filter, the diameter of the lens system, and the total lens length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained below in accordance with each conditional expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (8) defines the total lens length, excluding the back focal length from the optical lens length, of the zoom lens system normalized by the focal length of the zoom lens system in a telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When the ratio &Sgr;dw/ft exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (8), the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes too thick. As a result, the compactness that is the purpose of the present invention cannot be accomplished by the lens construction according to the present invention. Moreover, the weight including the lens barrel becomes heavier and the cost of the material also increases, so that it becomes unattractive as a common, high-zoom-ratio zoom lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression (8) is set to be less than 0.53, a common, high-zoom-ratio zoom lens can be realized with lower manufacturing cost. Moreover, when the upper limit of conditional expression (8) is set to be less than 0.50, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (8), the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes extremely narrow. As a result, the back focal length becomes short, so that the zoom lens system cannot be virtually used as an interchangeable lens of a single lens reflex camera. Since each lens group is necessary to have extremely strong power, correction of aberration becomes difficult. As a result, it becomes impossible to make the zoom ratio high, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (8) is set to be more than 0.20, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (9) defines the focal length of the first lens group normalized by that of the zoom lens system in the telephoto end state. To optimize the focal length of the first lens group is important condition for realizing a good aberration correction and for settling the length of the zoom lens system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> When the ratio f1/ft exceeds the upper limit of conditional expression (9), it means the power of the first lens group becomes weak, so that the total lens length of the zoom lens system becomes large. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a high-zoom-ratio zoom lens system like the present invention, the total lens length varies drastically in the telephoto state, so that it becomes difficult to carve a curve for a cam on a lens barrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In the case with extremely fewer lens elements like the present invention, it becomes more important to set optimum Petzval summation. When the power of the first lens group is decreased, Petzval summation becomes smaller, so that it becomes difficult to correct curvature of field and astigmatism. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When the upper limit of conditional expression (9) is set to be less than 0.55, it becomes possible to set better Petzval summation. Moreover, when the upper limit of conditional expression (9) is set to be less than 0.48, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. On the other hand, when the ratio falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (9), refractive power of the first lens group becomes extremely large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The increase of refractive power of the first lens group has the effect that the light ray entered to is 15 the front lens at large angle of view is further lowered to the periphery of the lens. Therefore, light quantity in the periphery of the field decreases. As a result, the diameter of the front lens and that of the filter become large, so that it is undesirable. Moreover, in the correction of aberration, peripheral coma in the wide-angle end state and spherical aberration in the telephoto end state become worse, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When the lower limit of conditional expression (9) is set to be more than 0.30, the maximum optical performance of the present invention can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In order to exhibit the maximum optical performance of the present invention, it is desirable that an aspherical surface is arranged in positive lens component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the lens group Gm having a convex surface facing to the object side. The aspherical surface has a shape that the curvature becomes small as the height goes from the optical axis to the periphery of the surface. This is for using the lens group Gm, which is the master lens group, as a fast optical system sufficiently corrected spherical aberration with fewer numbers of lens elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable that the positive lens component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the lens group Gm having a convex surface facing to the object side has aspherical surfaces on both object side and image side. The aspherical surface on the object side has a shape that the curvature becomes large as the height goes from the optical axis to the periphery of the surface. The aspherical surface on the image side has a shape that the curvature becomes small as the height goes from the optical axis to the periphery of the surface. As described above, this is for correcting spherical aberration of the lens group Gm itself well and for enhancing the effect to correct various off-axis aberrations. Because both aspherical surfaces are separated with each other by the thickness of the lens, the each aspherical surface has different height and angle of deviation with respect to each incident ray. By using the different height and angle of deviation for designing each aspherical surface, a plurality of aberrations can be corrected at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable that the following conditional expression (10) is satisfied: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>0.10<highlight><italic>&lt;nb&minus;na</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(10) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> where na denotes refractive index of the positive lens element La in the negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at d-line (&lgr;&equals;587.56 nm) and nb denotes that of the negative lens element Lb in the negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at d-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Conditional expression (10) defines the difference in refractive index between the positive lens element La and the negative lens element Lb in the negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When the difference falls below the lower limit of conditional expression (10), Petzval summation becomes smaller than an appropriate value and, as a result, curvature of field and astigmatism become difficult to correct, so that it is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable that the positive lens element La and the negative lens element Lb in the negative lens component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are a cemented negative lens. In this case, the number of lens parts becomes two. As a result, the mechanical structure of the lens barrel becomes simple, so that stability of manufacturing improves. Moreover, it becomes effective for correcting Petzval summation, off-axis aberrations as well as spherical aberration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> When the state of lens group positions is changed from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, all lens groups are moved independently such that the space between the first lens group G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, the space between the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> decreases, and the space between the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the fourth lens group Gm decreases. The focusing from the infinity to a closer object is carried out by moving the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the object side. </paragraph>

The fourth lens group Gm consists of, in order from the object, a double convex positive lens L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having aspherical surfaces on both sides, and a cemented negative lens L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constructed by a positive lens element La cemented with a negative lens element Lb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When the state of lens group positions is changed from a wide-angle end state to a telephoto end state, all lens groups are moved independently such that the space between the first lens group GI and the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, the space between the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> decreases, and the space between the third lens group G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the fourth lens group Gm decreases. The focusing from the infinity to a closer object is carried out by moving the second lens group G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the object side. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the respective graphs showing various aberrations, excellent compensation is made for various aberrations up to large angle of view in the wide-angle end state, in the intermediate focal length state, and in the telephoto end state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In each Example of each Embodiment, the aperture stop is arranged directly before the third lens group. However, the aperture stop may be arranged in the third lens group or directly before the fourth lens group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The aspherical surfaces introduced in the present invention can be replaced by any optical element having same optical effect in consequence such as a graded index optical element, a diffractive optical element, and a hybrid optical element constructed by a diffractive optical element connected with a refractive optical element. It is needless to say that an optical system whose aspherical surface is replaced by such an optical element is also included in the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The present invention makes it possible to provide a zoom lens system with an angle of view 2&ohgr; of about 74.1&deg; to 11.8&deg; and a zoom ratio of about 6.6, being ultimately small in diameter and compact, being composed of less number of elements, and having high cost performance and superb optical performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modification will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
