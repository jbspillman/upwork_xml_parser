<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a heat conductive resin substrate dissipating heat generated from electronic equipments and a semiconductor package excellent in heat radiation ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, a countermeasure of heat generated from the electronic equipment due to advance in integration of the semiconductor package and advance in high integration and speed up of LSI or the like accompanying with advance in performance, miniaturization and weight reduction in the electronic equipment has became to be very important problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a method using a printed circuit board made of metal or ceramic with high heat conductivity, a method forming thermal via-holes for dissipating heat in a substrate, a method using metal, ceramic or resin with high heat conductivity as semiconductor-packaging material, or a method interposing grease with high thermal conductivity or a heat conductive rubber with flexibility between a heat-generating source and a radiator or between a heat source and a heat-conducting plate for purpose of reduction in contact thermal resistance or the like have been practiced in order for diffusion of heat by heat-generating element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although a known resin substrate, that is, the glass-cloth epoxy resin substrate or the like used in the printed circuit board on which electronic components such as the semiconductor package are equipped is relatively excellent in mechanical property, dimension accuracy, workability of a through-hole and multi-layering as compared with the metal substrate or the ceramic substrate, there is a disadvantage of inferiority in heat conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it has been considered a method filling electrical insulation fillers such as metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal hydroxides and such as an aluminum oxide, a boron nitride, an aluminum nitride, a magnesium oxide, a zinc oxide, a silicon carbide, quartz and an aluminum hydroxide with high thermal conductivity into resin for a resin substrate which high heat conductivity is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, thermal conductivity of the resin substrate into which such heat conductive fillers are filled is to the extent of 3 W/mK at most, therefore, advance in thermal conductivity has been desired earnestly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to Japanese Patent Laid-open No.HEI9-255871, a thermoplastic resin composition containing a polybenzasol fiber and the moldings is proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the moldings such as a rigid resin composition, substrate material and case material with impact resistance, toughness, electrical insulation and heat conductivity. However, an upper limit of thermal conductivity of the substrate material obtained by this resin composition is approximately 1 W/mK, whereby heat conductive substrate material and the heat radiation semiconductor package of an object of the invention have not been obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the one hand, Japanese Patent Laid-open No.HEI11-17369 relates to heat radiation material consisting of a synthetic-resin wire rod with a certain diameter, which organic fibers are blended into a synthetic resin in the longitudinal direction. This heat radiation material is one which the synthetic-resin wire rods consisting of protrusion rods of 5 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length is blended, whereby the heat conductive substrate material and the semiconductor package excellent in heat radiation, of the object of the invention can not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, for the electronic components constituted by a plurality of different materials such as semi-conductive silicon, an alloy of a copper and iron system, aluminum, a solder, a silicon oxide, a nitride, a resin substrate and an adhesive, a countermeasure for malfunctions by a generating thermal stress becomes important because of difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of respective constituting materials. That is, when the thermal expansion coefficient of the resin substrate becomes possible, thermal and electrical reliability is improved, thereby being able to contribute for the industry. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a heat conductive substrate which is provided with electrical insulation and high heat conductivity, and is able to control a thermal expansion coefficient, a semiconductor package being excellent in heat radiation ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As a result of earnest studying for solving these problems, it has been found that the heat conductive resin substrate which the polybenzasol fibers are arranged in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the resin substrate, is provided with electrical insulation, and high heat conductivity and the thermal expansion coefficient can be controlled, and this invention is put into practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> That is, this invention relates to a heat conductive resin substrate wherein the polybenzasol fibers are oriented in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the resin substrate, and further, a semiconductor package wherein semiconductor chips are mounted on the heat conductive resin substrate which the polybenzasol fibers are oriented in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the resin substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The polybenzasol fiber used in the heat conductive resin substrate and the semiconductor package according to the invention is a fiber constituted of polybenzasol fiber polymer, and apolybenzasol (PBZ) means polybenzooxasol homopolymer (PBO), polybenzothiasol homopolymer (PBT) and random copolymer, sequential copolymer, block copolymer or graphed copolymer of those PBO and PBT, and is an organic polymer fiber excellent in strength, modulus of elasticity, heat resistance and electrical insulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Although a diameter, a shape of the cross section and a length of the polybenzasol fibers are not specified, the length of the fiber is preferable the same length as that of the resin substrate for heat transmission. The reason is that a length is same or the near to the same is the length, the larger becomes the thermal conductivity and a thermal expansion coefficient becomes lower. Moreover, for tensile strength of the polybenzasol fiber, it is preferable 4 G Pa or more and an initial modulus of elasticity for tension is 140 G Pa or more. The heat conductive resin substrate and the semiconductor package according to the invention can show more excellent heat conductivity by arranging in the resin substrate using the polybenzasol fiber which the tensile strength and the initial modulus of elasticity for tension are present within the range thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The heat conductive resin substrate according to the invention comprises a structure that the polybenzasol fibers are oriented in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the resin substrate. The heat conductivity of the longitudinal direction of the fiber arranged is improved by orienting the polybenzasol fibers in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the substrate. Moreover, heat conductivity in the any direction which respective polybenzasol fibers are oriented has become possible to increase, as well as the thermal expansion coefficients has become possible to control, by orienting the polybenzasol fibers not only in one direction of the thick direction (hereinafter defined this as a Z direction) or the direction of a surface (hereinafter defined this as a X direction or a Y direction), but also a plurality of directions such as in two directions of the surface, in two directions of the thick direction and one direction within the surface (the Z direction and the X direction), in three directions of the thick direction and two directions within the surface (the Z direction and the X direction and the Y direction), and in three directions or more of the thick direction and two directions or more within the surface (the Z direction and the X direction, the Y direction and an another direction within X Y surface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The concentration of the polybenzasol fiber allowing to contain in the heat conductive resin substrate is preferably 2 to 80 in volume percent. Improvement in heat conductivity becomes less, and the controlled range of the thermal expansion coefficient also becomes narrow when being less than 2 in volume percent. Workability and easiness of processing become very poor and is not avoided from intrusion of air bubbles when 80 volume percent is exceeded, thereby being not appropriate. The further preferable addition amount of the polybenzasol fiber is 20 to 70 in volume percent, and the yet further preferable addition amount is 40 to 60 in volume percent. Heat conductivity in at least one direction becomes 4 W/mK or more, and this range is preferable. </paragraph>

Furthermore, use of a polymer alloy consisting of a plurality of resins selected from these resins also is not interfered. Moreover, a cross-link method is not limited to the thermosetting property, but a resin according to the well-known cross-link methods such as a light-setting property and a wet-setting property can be used. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The heat conductive resin substrate according to the invention can be manufactured by impregnating a resin into the polybenzasol fibers oriented in the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the resin substrate to solidify. The polybenzasol fiber is obtained using long fibers themselves and woven-fabric like one justified in one direction, two directions or three directions to arrange in a board-like mold, and by impregnating a matrix resin such as a liquid state epoxy resin and a benzocyclobutene resin to cure. For the woven-fabric like one of the polyester fiber, all one in the form which are designated as a filament woven fabric, a spun yarn-woven fabric, a staple fiber, a woven fabric, a non-woven fabric, a cloth, a paper yarn, a felt, a pulp, a paper, a scrime, a chopped fiber or the like can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible to obtain by heating compressing and hardening so-called prepregs oriented the commercially available polybenzasol long fibers in one direction, two directions or more in the resin in a manner to overlap each other in one or a plurality of sheets. Furthermore, it can be manufactured by slice-processing such that the polybenzasol fibers are oriented in the any direction of the thick direction and/or in the direction of a surface of the substrate, after heating and press-forming a block-like cured body in a manner to overlap these prepregs each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to perform degreasing and cleaning processing of the surface of the polybenzasol fiber in advance, and to give an activation treatment such as an ultraviolet treatment, a corona treatment, a plasma treatment, flame treatment, in order to improve wetability and an adhesive ability of the polybenzasol fiber with the matrix resin. Furthermore, advance in strength and advance in thermal conductivity of the resin substrate which a large quantity of the polybenzasol fibers are oriented can be achieved by processing with the conventional an aluminum system after these surface treatments. Moreover, when forming process on the substrate, air bubbles in the resin and an interface between the fiber resins can be removed by pressurizing or reducing pressure to cure the resin. </paragraph>
