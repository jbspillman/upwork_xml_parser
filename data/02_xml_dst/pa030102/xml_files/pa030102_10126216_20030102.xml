<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Conjugate molecules comprising a ligand bonded to a polymer are disclosed. One such conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer, a chelating agent bonded to the polymer, and a radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent. The conjugate molecules may be useful in detecting and/or treating tumors or biological receptors. These conjugate molecules may be synthesized without the necessity of preactivation of the ligand using an SCN-polymer-chelating agent precursor. Conjugate molecules incorporating an annexin V ligand are particularly useful for visualizing apoptotic cells. Conjugate molecules incorporating a C225 ligand are particularly useful for targeting tumors expressing EGFR. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to compositions useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases, and, more specifically, to compositions comprising diagnostic agents (e.g., radioisotopes) and other compounds conjugated to ligands, useful for detecting, treating, or monitoring treatment of tumors and other tissues with biological receptors. The invention also relates to methods for synthesizing and using such compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Visualizing tumors and their response to therapy are important steps in the diagnosis and therapy of cancers in humans and in other animals. Various methods have been employed in the art. These methods include nuclear imaging, such as radioimmunoscintigraphy and receptor-mediated imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Most radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies used for radioimmunoscintigraphy and proteins for receptor-mediated imaging suffer from two key limitations: significant liver uptake, and rapid clearance from the body after administration. These properties can lead to obscured images due to high background activity, especially when imaging diseases in the abdomen, or to weak target activity because the ligands do not have sufficient time to interact with antigens or receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for new and improved compositions and methods for the visualization and treatment of tumors and other diseases, to compositions and methods for monitoring the response of tumors to therapy, and to methods for synthesizing such compositions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes problems and disadvantages associated with current therapeutic and diagnostic agents, and provides novel compositions for the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of treatment of tumors and other diseases. Some preferred compositions selectively bind to tumor cells expressing certain receptors, such as EGFR. Some preferred compositions allow for the non-invasive visualization of apoptotic cells in tumors and other tissues and thus, their response to therapy. The invention also provides novel methods for synthesizing these compositions. The new compositions preferably have longer in vivo half lives, reduced liver uptake, and higher imaging ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one embodiment is directed to a conjugate molecule comprising: a ligand bonded to a polymer; a chelating agent bonded to the polymer; and radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent. Preferably, the ligand is covalently bonded to the polymer and the chelating agent is covalently bonded to the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still another embodiment is directed to a composition comprising any of the conjugate molecules described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for synthesizing a ligand-polymer-chelating agent-diagnostic agent conjugate molecule comprising: providing an SCN-polymer-chelating agent precursor, wherein the polymer is covalently bonded to the chelating agent and the SCN group is covalently bonded to the polymer; combining a ligand with the SCN-polymer-chelating agent precursor to form a ligand-polymer-chelating agent conjugate; and combining the ligand-polymer-chelating agent conjugate with a diagnostic agent to form the ligand-polymer-chelating agent-diagnostic agent conjugate molecule. Preferably, in the resulting conjugate molecule, the ligand is covalently bonded to the polymer, the chelating agent is covalently bonded to the polymer, and the diagnostic agent is chelated to the chelating agent. Preferably, the ligand comprises a primary amino group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment is directed to a method for synthesizing a conjugate molecule comprising: providing a polymer conjugate-SCN precursor, wherein the SCN group is covalently bonded to the polymer conjugate; and combining a ligand with the polymer conjugate-SCN precursor to form a ligand-polymer conjugate molecule in which the ligand is covalently bonded to the polymer. The polymer conjugate may comprise a polymer covalently bonded to a chelating agent. The method may further comprise the it step of combining the ligand-polymer conjugate molecule with a diagnostic agent to form a ligand-polymer-chelating agent-diagnostic agent conjugate molecule. Preferably, the ligand comprises a primary amino group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes various methods for synthesizing conjugate molecules of the invention involving preactivation or other preparation of the ligand or polymer. One such method for synthesizing a conjugate molecule comprises the steps of: providing a polymer conjugate, wherein the polymer conjugate comprises at least one thio (SH) group covalently conjugated to the polymer conjugate; providing a ligand, the ligand comprising at least one thio reactive group; and combining the polymer conjugate and the ligand to form a ligand-polymer conjugate molecule, in which the ligand is preferably covalently bonded to the polymer by a thioether (S&mdash;C) bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The methods of the invention are not limited to processes where the ligand includes the thio reactive group. For example, the invention also includes methods for synthesizing a conjugate molecule in which either the ligand or the polymer conjugate has the thio reactive group. One such method comprises the steps of: providing a polymer conjugate and a ligand, wherein one of the polymer conjugate or the ligand comprises a thio group, and the other of the polymer conjugate or the ligand comprises a thio reactive group; and combining the polymer conjugate and the ligand to form a ligand-polymer conjugate molecule. The ligand is preferably covalently bonded to the polymer by a thioether (S&mdash;C) bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes therapeutic applications for the compositions of the invention. For example, one embodiment is directed to a method of treating a patient suspected of having a tumor comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate molecule to the patient. The conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer, a chelating agent bonded to the polymer, and a radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent.

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment is directed to a method for selectively delivering a diagnostic agent to apoptotic cells in a patient comprising: administering a conjugate molecule to the patient having apoptotic cells. The conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer, a chelating agent bonded to the polymer, and a radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent. The ligand is annexin V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment is directed to a method of visualizing tumors. This method comprises the steps of administering a conjugate molecule to a patient suspected of containing a tumor, and detecting the conjugate molecule. The conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer, a chelating agent bonded to the polymer, and a radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent. The ligand has affinity for and selectively binds to the tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Still another embodiment is directed to a method for imaging or visualizing apoptotic cells in a patient comprising the steps of: administering a conjugate molecule to the patient having apoptotic cells, wherein the conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer, wherein the ligand is annexin V, a chelating agent bonded to the polymer, and a radioisotope chelated to the chelating agent; and detecting the conjugate molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another method for visualizing tumors or apoptotic cells comprises the steps of administering a conjugate molecule to a patient suspected of having a tumor or apoptotic cells; and detecting the conjugate molecule.

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to novel conjugates useful for the visualization and targeted therapy of tumors and other target tissues, including conjugates useful for monitoring the response of tumors and other tissues to therapy. The invention is also directed to novel methods of synthesizing and using such conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As noted, most radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for radioimmunoscintigraphy and proteins for receptor-mediated imaging suffer two major limitations: (1) significant liver uptake; and (2) rapid clearance from the body after administration. These properties either lead to obscured images due to strong background activity, particularly for diseases in the abdomen, or to weak target activity because the ligands do not have enough time to interact with antigens or receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered that the imaging properties of ligands (e.g., monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or proteins) attached to metal chelators can be enhanced by using a polymer linker between the ligand and chelator. By introducing a polymer linker (such a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker) between the metal chelator and the ligand, the resulting construct, after being labeled with a radioisotope, may be used in radioscintigraphy to obtain optimized nuclear images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> PEG is an uncharged, hydrophilic, non-toxic, linear polymer. These characteristics make it particularly useful for protein/ligand modification. Modification of a ligand with PEG according to preferred embodiments of the invention may confer a number of advantages, such as improved biocompatibility, reduced liver uptake, increased circulation half-life, decreased immunogenicity, increased resistance to proteolysis and enhanced solubility and stability. It is believed that the reduction in immunogenicity is due to the steric hindrance by the PEG strands preventing recognition of foreign protein by the immune system. The PEG-modification is believed to interfere with the recognition of foreign particles and proteins by the reticuloendothelial system, and thus reduces the liver uptake of the particles and proteins. Further, attachment of metal chelators such as DTPA through a PEG linker instead of directly attaching DTPA and PEG sequentially to mAb is expected to reduce chemical manipulation of mAb, and maximize retention of the mAb&apos;s receptor-binding affinity. Improved tumor-to-normal tissue ratio allows for optimized tumor imaging. Further, using the described methods, the modified mAb can be synthesized in a reproducible manner, and the degree of substitution easily controlled and the products conveniently characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in the Examples, novel ligand-polymer-chelating agent-radioisotope constructs were synthesized. In one construct, mAb C225 was used as a model protein, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) labeled with Indium-111 (<highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In) was used as a model radioisotope chelator, and PEG was used as the polymer linker. In the resulting conjugate, one end of the PEG linker molecule was attached to C225 and another end was attached to <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> C225 is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or EGF receptor) antibody. Specifically, C225 is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against human EGFR. EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. EGFR is overexpressed on the cells of over one-third of all solid tumors, including bladder, breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, renal cell, squamous cell, non-small cell lung, and head and neck carcinomas. C225 specifically binds to the external domain of the receptor with an affinity comparable to the natural ligand. C225 is believed to inhibit both the initiation and propagation of EGFR positive cells, therefore stopping tumor growth. C225 has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of human cancer cells stimulated by the transforming growth factor-&agr; (TGF-&agr;) and EGFR autocrine loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In vitro studies (immunoprecipitation, competitive binding, and cytotoxicity assays) demonstrated that the constructs retained C225&apos;s binding affinity. Specifically, MDA-MB-468 human breast adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR were incubated with 1 &mgr;g/ml of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 or <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 in the presence of native C225 mnAb. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the binding of both radiomolecules to the cells was EGFR specific, because they could be displaced by native C225. Both <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 were able to compete with native C225 mAb for the binding to MDA-468 cells. In the presence of 1 &mgr;g/ml of native C225 mAb (equal to the amount of the labeled molecules), 64% of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 and 33% of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 were competitively bound to the cells. These data indicate that 1:30 DTPA-PEG-C225 retained about half of its binding affinity as compared to DTPA-C225. <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 was almost fully displaced by a 16-fold excess of C225, whereas only 80% of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 was displaced by a 16-fold excess of C225 and could not be fully displaced even by a 40-fold excess of C225. The remaining 20% of cell-associated <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 represents non-specific binding. These results indicate that modification of C225 with PEG according to the invention reduced the non-specific interaction of the antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To further assess the receptor-binding affinity of DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates, the capacity of DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates to immunoprecipitate EGFR was investigated using a human vulvar squamous carcinoma cell line A431 that expresses high level of EGFR. The A431 cells were exposed to mAb C225 or each of the three DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates with different degrees of substitution for half an hour and then were lysated. The antibody-receptor immunocomplexes were collected by protein A-Sepharose beads. Western blotting techniques were applied to assess the levels of EGFR immunoprecipitated by mAb C225 and DTPA-PEG-C225 derivatives. The levels of EGFR revealed by western blotting represent the amounts of C225 bound to the receptor. As such, the EGFR levels revealed the receptor-binding capacity of C225 and its derivatives. In the immunoprecipitation study, all three DTPA-PEG-C225 molecules (1:10, 1:20 and 1:40) with 25%, 40% or 70% amino groups in C225 substituted, maintained specific binding capacity to the EGFR in A431 cells. The levels of EGFR immunoprecipitated by C225 derivatives decreased with the increase of degree of substitution, which indicated that the binding affinity of the derivatives decreased with the increase of PEG-modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A DiFi cell line was used to evaluate in vitro antitumor activity of DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates. Blockage of DiFi cell growth by native C225, free DTPA-PEG and DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates was evaluated. The viable cell numbers resulting from treatment with DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates were remarkably reduced. There was no obvious difference of blocking capacities between DTPA-PEG-C225 derivatives with different degrees of modification. The results also showed that the tumor cell inhibition capacities of PEG-modified antibodies were similar to that of intact C225 mAb. DiFi cells were also treated with DTPA-PEG under the same conditions as for C225 and its conjugates. PEG-DTPA had no effect on DiFi cell growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In vivo imaging studies of the construct also yielded favorable results. The in vivo pharmacokinetic and gamma imaging properties of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 were compared to that of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225. <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 was shown to be less widely distributed to normal tissues than <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225, which may be due to reduced non-specific binding of C225 by PEG-modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Tumors of A431 and MDA468 xenografts expressing high levels of EGFR were clearly visualized with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225, while tumors of MDA435 xenograft that express low levels of EGFR were barely visible. In A431 tumor, the tumor uptakes of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 were similar to that of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225. The liver uptakes, however, were reduced by almost 50% for <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 as compared to <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225. Blocking EGFR by preinjection of native C225 reduced uptakes of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 in both tumor and liver. The tumor-to-blood ratios in mice with A431 and MDA468 tumors dropped 63% and 53%, respectively, when unlabeled C225 was preinjected. In contrast, the tumor-to-blood ratio in mice with MDA435 tumor did not change significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Specifically, nude mice bearing A431 xenografts in chest and right hindlimb were injected with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225, 1:10 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 or 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225. Whole body gamma scintigrams of mice obtained at different time intervals were obtained. Immediately after injection of each radiotracer, images showed the highest activity in the central location, which is attributable to the cardiac blood pool, the liver and spleen. While activity in the liver of mice injected with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 dominated the images at 24 hours and 48 hours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), significant reduction of radioactivity in the liver was seen with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 derivatives, particularly at 24 hours and 48 hours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). Tumors in right hindlimb and in chest at the site of xenografts were visualized at 24 hours with all three C225 radiotracers. Tumors in mice injected with 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 was more clearly visualized than with the other two radiotracers, particularly at 48 hours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The above observations were confirmed by image quantification. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the radioactivity in tumors (both in chest and in hindlimb) expressed as tumor-to-whole body ratio per pixel obtained from sequential gamma camera images at different time intervals. All three radiotracers demonstrated increased tumor radioactivity relative to the whole body background over time; the radioactivity reached the maximum at 24 hours. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> presents tumor-to-liver ratio per pixel as a function of time. PEG-modified C225 had significantly higher tumor-to-liver ratios than C225 without PEG at each time point (P&lt;0.05), and the values appeared to increase over time. There was no significant difference in tumor-to-whole body radioactivity ratios with the three radiotracers (p&gt;0.05) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Therefore, the increase of tumor-to-liver ratios of PEG-modified C225 was due to the decrease of hepatic uptake. Dissection analysis at 48 hours confirmed the findings revealed by the images. Tumor uptake, expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tumor, showed no significant difference between 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225, 1:10. <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225. No obvious difference was observed in muscle uptake. The uptake of PEG-modified C225 in the liver, however, was greatly reduced as compared to C225 without PEG (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> To investigate whether the uptake of DTPA-PEG-C225 in the tumor was mediated through specific interaction of the antibody with the EGFR, each mouse bearing A431 xenografts was preinjected with 1 mg of native C225 to block the EGFR. Twenty hours later, 10 &mgr;g of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 was administered intravenously. The &ggr;-camera images showed suppression of tumor uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 by C225 pretreatment. Dissection analysis performed at 48 hours after injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 showed that preinjection of C225 significantly reduced the tumor-to-blood ratio, as well as liver-to-blood ratio, of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225. The results were in agreement with data obtained from &ggr;-images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To further demonstrate that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 can specifically localize in tumors that overexpress EGFR, A431, MDA-468 and MDA-435 human tumor xenografts were used in an imaging study. A431 vulvar squamous cell line and MDA468 breast adenocarcinoma cell line express high levels of EGFR, 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>receptors per cell and 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>receptors per cell, respectively. In contrast, MDA435 breast adenocarcinoma cell line expresses low level of EGFR. Nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts received 10 &mgr;g/mouse of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 (50 &mgr;Ci). Images obtained at 24 hours demonstrated higher accumulation of the radiotracer in tumors at the sites of A431 and MDA468 xenografts than MDA435 xenograft. Tumors were barely seen for MDA435 model. Dissection analysis performed at 48 hours after injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 demonstrated that the tumor-to-blood ratios for A431 and MDA468 xenografts were significantly higher than that for MDA435 (P&equals;0.009 for A431 model and P&lt;0.001 for MDA468 model, respectively). Preinjection of C225 20 hours before administration of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 significantly reduced the tumor-to-blood ratios for A431 (P&equals;0.04) and MB468 (P&lt;0.001) tumors, but not for MB435 tumor (P&equals;0.3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The foregoing findings demonstrate that the <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 construct selectively localizes to tumors that express high numbers of EGFR. PEG-modification of mAb C225 reduced non-specific interaction and significantly reduced the liver uptake, resulting in improved visualization of tumors with EGFR. Thus, by using a polymer linker, such as PEG, between the mAb or proteins and metal chelator, the imaging characteristics of the mAb- or protein-based scintigraphic agents were optimized. By attaching the metal chelator to one end of PEG molecule rather than directly to the protein/mAb molecules, the retention of receptor binding affinity was maximized, leading to improved imaging properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the data demonstrate that modification of antibodies with PEG can reduce liver uptake of the antibodies and optimize &ggr;-imaging properties. These improvements make PEG-modified proteins according to the invention useful RIS agents for receptor imaging. Coupled with appropriate radionuclides, the constructs of the invention may be used for RIT for the treatment of cancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The C225 conjugate molecule used in Examples 1-16 was synthesized according to the scheme set out in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Although the reaction between sulfhydryl and maleimide is highly selective, it requires preactivation of the ligand (see Example 5). This necessitates an additional purification step. Further, the number of PEG molecules attached to the proteins may not necessarily agree with the number of amino groups that have been modified with maleimide, making it difficult to control the degree of PEGylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It has further been discovered that conjugate molecules according to the invention may alternately be synthesized using a new, more simplified procedure. By introducing an NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>reactive group, e.g., an SCN group, at one end of the PEG molecule, PEGylation of ligand proteins may be achieved by simply mixing SCN-PEG-DTPA with the ligand protein without the necessity of preactivation of the ligand protein. The method provides a one step procedure to introduce both PEG and a metal chelator to proteins through a heterofunctional PEG precursor. The method eliminates the activation step and better controls the degree of protein modification. The procedure is a general one and can be broadly applied, for example, to the PEGylation of any protein, peptide or monoclonal antibody molecule that contains primary amino groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a heterofunctional PEG molecule with one end of the polymer coupled to DTPA was designed as described in Example 3 but at the other end of the PEG molecule, a NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-reactive functional group isothiocyanate (SCN-) was introduced. This precursor molecule (SCN-PEG-DTPA) is obtained as lyophilized powder and can be stored at &minus;20&deg; C. for months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> By using introducing the SCN-group, PEGylation of proteins was subsequently achieved by simply mixing SCN-PEG-DTPA with protein in aqueous solution at 4&deg; C. overnight without pre-activation of the proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> To demonstrate the utility of SCN-PEG-DTPA precursor in PEGylation and radiolabeling of proteins, annexin V was used as a model protein. Annexin V is a protein that binds with high affinity to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells (cells undergoing programmed cell death). Using novel methods of the invention, annexin V was successfully conjugated to PEG-DTPA-<highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A preferred synthetic scheme for the preparation of the SCN-PEG-DTPA precursor is outlined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. DTPA was first coupled to mono-protected PEG diamine. After removal of the t-Boc protection group, the resulting NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-PEG-DTPA was reacted with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, followed by catalytic hydrogenation to yield p-NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-benzoyl-PEG-DTPA. Treatment of p-NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-benzoyl-PEG-DTPA with thiophosgen yielded the target product SCN-PEG-DTPA with an overall yield of 74%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Annexin V was then conjugated to SCN-PEG-DTPA by simply mixing both agents together. The resulting conjugate was separated from unreacted PEG-DTPA by ion-exchange chromatography (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Since ion-exchange chromatography could not separate PEGylated annexin V from native annexin V, the reaction products were further analyzed by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). DTPA-PEG-annexin V (DTPA-PEG-AV) was then radiolabeled with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 1:30 and 1:60 preps of PEGylated annexin V were tested for their ability to bind to cells that had been treated with Ara-C to induce apoptosis. To evaluate the binding of PEGylated annexin V to apoptotic cells, human leukemia HL60 cells and B-cell lymphoma Raji cells were treated with Ara-C at 1.0 &mgr;M for 22 hours. Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry. Alternatively, cells were incubated with the radiolabeled annexin V and cell associated radioactivity was measured. Flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased 4-10 fold after treatment with Ara-C. Similarly, cell associated radioactivity with the 1:30 prep was also increased 4-6 fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To demonstrate that PEGylation of annexin V improves the blood half life of the protein, the 1:15 prep of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V was injected into nude mice and blood was drawn at different time points after injection of the radiotracer. The annexin V activities in blood circulation after dosing with PEGylated annexin V were significantly higher than those from unPEGylated annexin V at all time points (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>). Both profiles fit well into a two-compartment model and can be mathematically described by the equations of: C<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;41.0e.<highlight><superscript>&minus;0.14t</superscript></highlight>&plus;8.0e<highlight><superscript>&minus;0.03t </superscript></highlight>for PEGylated annexin V and C<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;50.2e<highlight><superscript>&minus;9.51t</superscript></highlight>&plus;0.33e<highlight><superscript>&minus;00.04t </superscript></highlight>for unPEGylated annexin V, where C<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>is percentage injected dose per ml of blood at any given time, t. The half-life values from PEGylated annexin V were 4.90 hours and 26.3 hours for t<highlight><subscript>1/2, &agr;</subscript></highlight> and t<highlight><subscript>1/2, &bgr;</subscript></highlight>, respectively, while those from unPEGylated annexin V were 0.07 hours and 17.4 hours for t<highlight><subscript>1/2, &agr;</subscript></highlight> and t<highlight><subscript>1/2, &bgr;</subscript></highlight>, respectively. The modification with PEGylation significantly prolonged the terminal half-life from 17 hours with unPEGylated annexin V to 26 hours, resulting from a significant reduction in clearance, from 0.4 ml/hr with unPEGylated annexin V to 0.01 ml/hr. The PEGylated annexin V was less widely distributed in vivo, as reflected in the reduced volume distribution from 6.1 ml with unPEGylated annexin V to 0.2 ml. Biodistributions of 1:15 prep <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-annexin V at 120 hours after the injection of each radiotracer are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. PEGylation resulted in significantly reduced uptake of annexin V in the kidney and increased uptake in the liver and the spleen. For <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V, the percentages of injected dose per gram of tissue for blood, liver, kidney, spleen, and muscle were 0.36&plusmn;0.05%, 8.37&plusmn;2.76%, 22.35&plusmn;4.74%, 6.75&plusmn;0.44, %, and 0.75&plusmn;0.04%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Finally, as shown in Examples 26 and 27, in vivo results demonstrate that apoptosis induced by PG-Paclitaxel correlates with the uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In labeled PEGylated annexin V (<highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV) in MDA-MB-468 tumors. This provides further support that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV and similar conjugates of the invention may be used to visualize apoptosis in cells, e.g., following chemotherapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Normally, native annexin V is rapidly cleared from the blood after intravenous injection. However, as demonstrated in the Examples, conjugation of PEG to annexin V according to the invention prolongs the circulation time of native annexin V. Because apoptosis is a dynamic process in which apoptotic cells are rapidly removed by phagocytic macrophages, longer or prolonged circulation of radiolabeled annexin V will make it possible to capture cells undergoing the early phase of apoptosis during a prolonged period of time. It will also make it possible to deliver radiolabeled annexin V to less perfused tissues. The prolonged blood half-life of preferred annexin V conjugates of the invention will allow more radiolabeled annexin V bind to apoptotic cells in tumor, resulting in improved imaging property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in the examples, precursor PEG molecules were successfully synthesized and coupled to a ligand (annexin V) without having to preactivate the ligand. The demonstrated in vitro binding of the resulting conjugate to drug-treated cells, the favorable pharmacokinetics of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-labeled, PEGylated annexin V, and the in vivo results indicate that radiolabeled, PEGylated annexin, which can be readily synthesized by the disclosed methods, may be used to image apoptosis and thus, to non-invasively image early responses to anticancer therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is directed to novel conjugate molecules which may be useful for the visualization and treatment of tumors or biological receptors, including visualization of response to therapy. The conjugates may be used in nuclear imaging, including radioimmunoscintigraphy and receptor-mediated imaging. A preferred embodiment is a conjugate molecule comprising a ligand (e.g., a protein, peptide or antibody), a polymer, a chelating agent, and a diagnostic agent, which is preferably a radioisotope. Preferably the ligand is bonded to the polymer, the chelating i5 agent is bonded to the polymer, and the radioisotope is chelated to the chelating agent. As used herein, &ldquo;bonded&rdquo; refers to any physical or chemical attachment, including, but not limited to, covalent bonding or ionic and chelating interactions.

In this embodiment, the conjugate molecule comprises a ligand bonded to a polymer and a near-infrared dye bonded to the polymer. Preferably, near-infrared dye is ICG or an ICG derivative. The ligand has affinity for and selectively binds to the tumor or apoptotic cells. The detecting step may comprise detection of the near-infrared dye by a near-infrared camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In all of the foregoing therapeutic/diagnostic methods the patient can be any animal. Preferably the patient is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, a dog, a cat, a horse, a cow, a pig, a rat, a mouse or other mammal. More preferably, the patient is a human. As used herein, &ldquo;patient&rdquo; broadly includes, but is not limited to, a human or any animal being treated, tested or monitored in any kind of therapeutic, diagnostic, research, development or other application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing methods, the administering step may be performed parenterally, e.g., by intravascular, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or intratumoral injection. The conjugate molecule may be administered by inhalation or another suitable route. Preferably, administration is by intravascular injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing therapeutic/diagnostic methods, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate molecules of the invention are preferably administered to achieve the desired effect (e.g., treatment of, delivery to, or visualization of, the target). The actual dosage amount of a composition comprising the conjugate molecules of the present invention administered to the patient to achieve the desired effect can be determined by physical and physiological factors such as body weight, severity of condition, the type of disease being treated/visualized, previous or concurrent therapeutic interventions, idiopathy of the patient and route of administration, as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. The practitioner responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the concentration of active ingredient(s) in a composition and appropriate dose(s) for the individual subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes kits incorporating the conjugate molecules of the invention. Any of the compositions described herein may be comprised in a kit. The kit may also contain means for delivering the formulation such as, for example, a syringe for systemic administration, an inhaler or other pressurized aerosol canister. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The kits may comprise a suitably aliquoted composition of the present invention. The components of the kits may be packaged either in aqueous media or in lyophilized form. The container means of the kits may include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe or other container means, into which a component may be placed, and preferably, suitably aliquoted. Where there are more than one component in the kit, the kit also will generally contain a second, third or other additional container into which the additional components may be separately placed. However, various combinations of components may be comprised in a vial. The kits of the present invention also will typically include a means for containing the aerosol formulation, one or more components of an aerosol formulation, additional agents, and any other reagent containers in close confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include injection or blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained. The kit may have a single container, or it may have distinct container for each compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When the components of the kit are provided in one or more liquid solutions, the liquid solution is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being particularly preferred. However, the components of the kit may be provided as dried powder(s). When reagents and components are provided as a dry powder, the powder can be reconstituted by the addition of a suitable solvent. It is envisioned that the solvent may also be provided in another container means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The container means will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, syringe and/or other container means, into which a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of the pharmaceutically composition, a component of an aerosol formulation and/or an additional agent formulation are placed, preferably, suitably allocated. The kits may also comprise a second container means for containing a sterile, pharmaceutically acceptable buffer and/or other diluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The kits of the present invention will also typically include a means for containing the vials in close confinement for commercial sale, such as, e.g., injection or blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of the number or type of containers, the kits of the invention may also comprise, or be packaged with, an instrument for assisting with the delivery of the aerosol formulation within the body of an animal. Such an instrument may be a syringe, an inhaler, air compressor or any such medically approved delivery vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The use of the above described conjugate molecules is advantageous over those previously described in the art. Preferred embodiments of the invention are useful for visualizing and treating tumors and other diseased tissues and, in the case of annexin V and similar conjugates, monitoring the response of tumors to therapy. The invention may be used in diagnostic, therapeutic, research and other applications. Preferred conjugates have improved in vivo half lives, exhibit reduced or eliminated accumulation in the liver, and may be adapted for therapeutic uses. The use of polymers reduces non-specific interaction with non-target tissues and reduces background activity. Attachment of the chelating agent to the polymer instead of to the ligand directly improves retention of the ligand&apos;s receptor binding affinity. The conjugate molecule design strategy is extremely flexible, and allows for the preparation of a wide array of molecules for different diagnostic and clinical uses. It allows both passive (when ligand is not attached) and active (when ligand is attached) targeting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> DTPA-PEG-ATA can be coupled to maleimide-activated antibodies following a simple in situ deprotection step to release the free SH group. Maleimide-activated C225 with different ratios of C225 to maleimide was prepared according to the following general procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The general synthetic scheme for the preparation of DTPA-PEG-C225 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Other antibodies, polymers, and chelating agents can be easily substituted to arrive at alternative products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> To an aqueous solution of C225 (2.4 mg/ml; 4.8 mg, 0.032 pmol) at room temperature was added aliquots of GMBS in dimethylformamide (DW) (2.8 mg/ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 hour, then purified by gel filtration using a PD-10 column. Prior to conjugation with activated C225, the acetyl protecting group in DTPA-PEG-ATA was removed using hydroxylamine. For this purpose, an aliquot of NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OH (50 &mgr;l) in 0.1 M Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(0.5 M) was added to a solution of DTPA-PEG-ATA (7.7 mg, 1.92 &mgr;moles) in 0.1 M Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(pH 8.5, 0.5 ml), then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting DTPA-PEG-SH containing free sulfhydryl group was then mixed with maleimide-activated C225 with DTPA-PEG-SH-to-maleimide molar ratio of 2:1 and incubated at 4&deg; C. overnight. The final product was separated from unreacted DTPA-PEG by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.5 cm&times;20 cm) with PBS as eluent. The presence of free sulfhydryl group was monitored using Elhman&apos;s agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Four DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates with different degrees of C225 modification were synthesized. These conjugates were designated as 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, and 1:40 DTPA-PEG-C225, with the numbers being the molar ratios of antibody to GMBS in the maleimide-activating reaction. The physicochemical properties of the newly synthesized conjugates and some of the <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-labeled molecules are summarized in Table 1. Each C225 molecule contained approximately 50-60 free amino groups as measured by TNBS assay. In the 1:10, 1:20, 1:30 and 1:40 DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates, approximately 20-25%, 40%, 60% and 70% of amino groups were substituted, respectively. DTPA-C225 with DTPA directly attached to C225 mAb was also synthesized for the purpose of comparison (Table 1). Because DTPA-anhydride was readily hydrolyzed in aqueous media, coupling of DTPA directly to C225 was an inefficient reaction. Only 10-20% of the amino groups in C225 were substituted by DTPA when the molar ratio of DTPA-dianhydride to C225 reached 800:1.

The resulting radioisotopic product was purified from free <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In by gel filtration on a PD-10 column using PBS as the eluent. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. The radioactivity of each fraction was measured by a radioisotope calibrator (Capintec Instruments, Ramsey, N.J.). The protein content in each fraction was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer&apos;s instruction (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The fractions containing the protein were combined. The radiochemical yield, expressed as percentage of radioactivity of the protein fractions to the total loaded radioactivity, was calculated. The radiochemical purity was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). </paragraph>

The lower yield with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 reflects the fact that a large amount of DTPA was introduced into the coupling reaction between DTPA-dianhydride and C225. Although extensive purification procedures including ultracentrifligation and gel filtration on GPC column were used, DTPA-C225 could still be contaminated by trace amounts of DTPA molecules, leading to low labeling efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The degrees of substitution of C225 by maleimide was determined by quantifying the free amino groups remaining in the antibody using TNBS assay according to the published protocol (Bioconjugate Techniques, G. T. Hermanson, Ed., San Diego, Academic Press, pp. 112-114, 1996). Briefly, samples were dissolved in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) at a concentration of 20-200 &mgr;g/ml. To 1 ml of each sample solution was added 0.5 ml TNBS solution in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (0.01%, w/v). After incubation at 37&deg; C. for 2 hours, 0.5 ml of 10% SDS and 0.25 ml of 1 N HCl were sequentially added to each sample. The percentage of the reacted amino groups was determined by comparing the UV absorbance (335 nm) of the free amino groups in the modified antibody with that of those in the intact antibody. </paragraph>

Samples were eluted with PBS containing 0.1% LiBr at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the products were detected by the refractive index and UV absorbance at 254 run. Radio-GPC was performed using an HPLC unit equipped with LDC pumps (Laboratory Data Control, Rivera Beach, Fla.), an LUDLUM radiometric detector (Measurement Inc, Sweetwater, Tex.), and an SP 8450 LTVNIS detector (Spectra-Physics, San Jose, Calif.). The samples were separated by a Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S3000 7.8 mm&times;30 cm column, eluted with PBS containing 0.1% LiBr at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and detected by radioactivity and UV absorbance at 254 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> GPC was used to monitor the purity of C225 conjugates and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-labeled C225 conjugates. Coupling of PEG to C225 increased the hydrodynamic volume of C225. The retention time of intact C225 (6.0 minutes) on TSK-G3000 column was shortened to 4.9 minutes for 1:30 DTPA-PEG-C225, suggesting that PEG molecules were chemically bound to the mAb. The GPC chromatogram of purified DTPA-PEG-C225 also indicated that gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 column adequately removed unconjugated C225. However, when 1:30 DTPA-PEG-C225 was labeled with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In, it gave two peaks in radio-GPC, with retention times of about 5.9 minutes and 8.5 minutes, respectively. The major peak at 5.9 minutes corresponded to 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 while the minor peak at 8.5 minutes, which reflects a retention time identical to that of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG, was attributed to unconjugated DTPA-PEG. Thus, another gel filtration procedure was necessary to remove <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG. The 1:30 and 1:10 conjugates were eluted at 5.7 minutes and 6.1 minutes, respectively, reflecting shorter retention times than <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225, 6.7 minutes. These results further confirmed that there were more PEG molecules attached to the 1:30 DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugate than to the 1:10 conjugate. The radiopurities of purified 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225, 1:10 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225, and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 were &gt;99%, &gt;97%, and &gt;99%, respectively (Table 1). </paragraph>

The medium was replaced by DMEM/F-12 medium plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 &mgr;g/ml of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 or <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 plus native C225 mAb at the indicated concentrations were added to the wells. After incubation at 37&deg; C. for 2 hours, the cells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.2% BSA. The cells were then trypsinized and transferred to 5 ml disposable culture tubes. The level of radioactivity in each tube was measured with a Cobra Auto-gamma Counter (Packard Instrument Company, Downers Grove, Ill.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> A plateau was reached at 2 &mgr;g/ml for 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225. Therefore, a concentration of 1 &mgr;g/ml for the radiolabeled C225 was chosen for the competitive binding assay. </paragraph>

The cells were incubated with 1 &mgr;g/ml of each <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-labeled C225 conjugates plus unlabeled C225 at different concentrations. After incubation at 37&deg; C. for 2 hours, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a gamma-counter. The data are expressed as counts per minute (CPM) as a percentage of control (v-axis) versus &mgr;g/ml unlabelled C225 &agr;-axis) and presented as the means of triplicates with standard deviations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The binding of both 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 and <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 to MDA-MB-468 cells was displaced by C225 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the binding is EGFR specific (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Furthermore, <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 was almost fully displaced by a 16-fold excess of C225, whereas <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 was only 80% displaced by a 16-fold excess of C225 and could not be fully displaced even by 40-fold excess of C225. The remaining 20% of cell-associated <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 represents nonspecific binding to the cells. These results suggest that modification of C225 with PEG reduced the nonspecific interaction of the antibody. When the contribution of non-specific binding is taken into consideration and is deducted from the cell-associated radioactivity, 44% of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 and 33% of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 remained bound to the cells when the concentration of native C225 mAb was equal to the concentration of the labeled molecules (1 &mgr;g/ml). This means that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-C225 retained about 88% of the receptor binding affinity of native C225, while 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 retained about 66% of the binding affinity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A431 cells were cultured with C225 or DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates at 37&deg; C. for 30 minutes, followed by washing the cells twice with cold PBS and lysis of the cells with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 &mgr;g/ml leupeptin, and 25 &mgr;g/ml aprotinin. The lysates were centrifuged at the fall speed of a microcentrifuge for 15 minutes and the supernatants were collected for protein concentration determination. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of 100 &mgr;g of cell lysate with 40 &mgr;l Sepharose 4B-conjugated protein A at room temperature for 1 hour, followed by washing the immunoprecipitates three times with the lysing buffer and separation of immunoprecipitates with 7% polyacrylamide SDS-electrophoresis. Western blot was carried out by electronically transferring the samples into a nitrocellulose membrane and incubation of the membrane for 1 hour with an anti-EGFR antibody. The EGFR signals in the membrane were developed by the ECL chemoluminescence detection kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The ability of DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates to bind to EGFR was investigated in A431 cells, which express a very high level of EGFR. The cells exposed to C225 or one of the three 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates were lysed, followed by immunoprecipitation of the antibody-bound EGFR with protein A-Sepharose beads and visualization of the EGFR with Western blot analysis. All three DTPA-PEG-C225 conjugates with 20%, 50%, and up to 70% of amino groups in C225 substituted, retained their EGFR binding activities. However, the amounts of EGFR immunoprecipitated by C225 conjugates decreased with increasing degree of substitution, indicating that the binding affinity of the PEG-modified C225 decreased with the increasing number of PEG molecules attached to the mAb. </paragraph>

Cell viability after 72 hour treatment of the cells with C225 or DTPA-PEG-C225 was assayed by adding 50 &mgr;l of 10 mg/ml MTT (3-&lsqb;4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl&rsqb;-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma) into 0.5 ml of culture medium and incubating the cells for 3 hours at 37 AC in a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>incubator, followed by cell lysis with 500 &mgr;l of lysis buffer containing 20% SDS in dimethyl formamide/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, pH 4.7, at 37&deg; C. for more than 6 hours.

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> It has previously been reported that blocking EGFR tyrosine kinase activity with C225 leads to cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death through apoptosis in DiFi cells (Br. J. Cancer, 92:1991-1999, 2000). While the linker molecule PEG-DTPA itself had no effect on DiFi cell growth, all three conjugates, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 DTPA-PEG-C225, inhibited the tumor cell growth to the same extent as native C225, indicating that all conjugates were capable of inducing apoptosis in the DiFi human colon cancer cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Mice with A431 tumors were pretreated with 1 mg of native C225 at 30 minutes or 20 hours before intravenous injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225. Gamma scintigrams of the mice taken at 6 hours and 24 hours after the radiotracer injection showed markedly reduced liver uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 in both groups. While suppression of tumor activity was seen in mice injected with C225 20 hours before radiotracer injection, this effect was not obvious in scintigrams of mice given C225 30 minutes before injection of the radiotracer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Dissection analysis performed 48 hours after injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 showed that pretreatment with C225 significantly reduced the tumor-to-blood ratio (P&lt;0.05) (Tables 3 and 4; values represent mean &plusmn;standard deviation of 3 mice per group; data are expressed as percentages of injected dose per gram of tissue (% IND/g)). Tumor-to-muscle ratio also was reduced, albeit to a lesser degree. Pretreatment with C225 also significantly reduced liver uptake of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 (P&lt;0.005 at 20-hour interval; P&lt;0.05 at 30-minute interval). As a result, blood pool activity was significantly elevated. Notably, pretreatment with C225 only caused a moderate decrease in tumor uptake of the radiotracer when the interval between the administration of C225 and 1:30 was 20 hours. At a shorter interval (30 minutes) between the delivery of the two agents, the uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 in the tumor was actually significantly increased (P&lt;0.05, Tables 2 and 3).

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> To demonstrate that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 can localize specifically in tumors that overexpress EGFR, human tumor xenografts expressing different levels of EGFR in the gamma imaging study were used. Western analysis of A431, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-435 confirmed that both A431 and MDA-MB-435 express high levels of EGFR, while MDA-MB-435 express negligible amounts of EGFR. Gamma scintigrams of both A431 and MDA-MB-468 tumors in the chest and hindlimb sites demonstrated substantial activity 24 hours after injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225. In contrast, less tumor activity was visualized in MDA-MB-435 tumors than in the other two tumor xenografts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Forty-eight hours after injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225, the tumor-to-blood ratios for A431 and MDA-MB-468 xenografts were significantly higher than those for the MDA-MB-435 xenografts (P&equals;0.009 for A431 tumors; P&lt;0.001 for MDA-MB-468 tumors). The ratios increased from about 1 for EGFR-negative MDA-MB-435 tumors to over 6 for EGFR-positive A431 and MDA-MB-468 tumors. Pretreatment with C225 20 hours before injection of 1:30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-C225 significantly reduced the tumor-to-blood ratios for A431 (P&equals;0.04) and MDA-MB-468 (P&lt;0.001) tumors, but not for MDA-MB-435 tumors (P&equals;0.3). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The 1:30 and 1:60 preps of PEGylated annexin V were tested for their ability to bind to cells that had been treated with Ara-C to induce apoptosis. Human leukemia HL60 or human B-cell lymphoma Raji cells (1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml each) were treated with Ara-C at 1.0 &mgr;M for 6 hours or 22 hours to induce apoptosis. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and re-suspended in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5 containing 140 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) at a concentration of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml. Five gl annexin V-FITC solution (50 &mgr;g/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl) was added into the control cells as well as treated cells. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Apoptotic cells stained with annexin V-FITC (Sigmna) were quantified with a Labsystems Fluoroskan FL flow cytometer (Helsinki, Finland) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Alternatively, 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells were suspended in 0.3 ml of binding buffer and incubated with 30 <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV (330 &mgr;Ci/ml, 33 &mgr;g/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, centrifuged and counted for cell-associated radioactivity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the y-axis represents the percent apoptotic cells; the x-axis represents the time after treatment in hours. In the paired bars, the bars on the left represent HL60 cells. The bars on the right represent Raji cells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a bar graph showing binding of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V to Ara-C treated cells. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the y-axis represents radioactivity in cpm; the x-axis represents time after treatment in hours. In each group of bars, the leftmost bars represent HL60 cells, DTPA-PEG-AV, 1:30 prep; the middle bars represent Raji cells, DTPA-PEG-AV, 1:30 prep; and the rightmost bars represent Raji cells, DTPA-PEG-AV, 1:60 prep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, flow cytometry analysis using fluorescent annexin V-FITC as a probe showed that treatment with Ara-C at a concentration of 1.0 &mgr;M induced apoptosis of both HL60 cells and Raji cells, with increasing percentage of cells undergoing apoptotic process as the time of treatment increased (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> similar trend was observed with 1:30 prep of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV. The radioactivity associated with cells treated with Ara-C increased with increasing time (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Specifically, flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased 4-10 fold after treatment with Ara-C. Similarly, cell associated radioactivity was also increased 4-6 fold. Interestingly, the 1:60 prep of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV did not show binding to the Ara-C treated cells, suggesting that extensive modification abolished the binding affinity of annexin V to phosphatidylserine. These results suggest that the 1:30 prep binds to apoptotic cells the same way as annexin V-FITC does, and that the 1:30 prep is more suitable for imaging of apoptotic cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Apoptosis Induced by PG-Paclitaxel Correlates with Uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In Labeled PEGylated Annexin V in MDA-MB-468 Tumors </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The following materials and methods were used in this example. Human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in 1:1 (v/v) Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle&apos;s medium (DMEM)/Ham&apos;s F-12 mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.) at 37C in 5% CO2/95% air. Female BALB/c mice with a nu/nu background were subcutaneously injected with MDA-MB-468 (1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells/site) in the chest. When the xenografts reached 6-8 mm in diameter, the mice were divided into groups of 4 each. Mice in Group I were not treated and were used as a control. In Group II, mice were injected intravenous with PG-paclitaxel (PG-TXL) at an equivalent paclitaxel (Taxol, TXL) dose of 100 mg/kg 1 day before the injection of radiotracer. PG-TXL is a water-soluble polymeric conjugate of paclitaxel and poly(1-glutamic acid). It has demonstrated significant antitumor activity with reduced systemic toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies. The conjugate has the same mechanism of action as paclitaxel. Both paclitaxel and PG-TXL block cells in the G2/M phase of cell cycle and subsequently induce apoptosis. In Group III, mice were injected with PG-TXL at an equivalent dose of 100 mg/kg 4 days before the injection of radiotracer. In Group IV, mice were injected i.p. with C225 at a dose of 50 mg/kg 4 days before the injection of radiotracer. C225 is a monoclonal antibody against EGFR. In Group V, mice were treated intravenous with PG-TXL (100 mg eq./kg) and i.p. with C225 (50 mg/kg) simultaneously 4 days before the injection of the radiotracer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> For imaging studies, the mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg), then administered with 8 &mgr;g/mouse of 1:30 prep of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-labeled, PEGylated annexin V (50 &mgr;Ci/mouse) via tail vein. A DigiRad camera (Model 2020tc, San Diego, Calif.) equipped with a medium-energy collimator and Mirage processing software (Segami Corp) was used for the gamma-imaging. The mice were placed prone on the camera&apos;s parallel hole collimator. The images were acquired in a 64&times;64 matrix for 5 minutes, at 2, 24, and 48 hours after injection of radiotracer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Immediately after the last imaging session, the mice were killed and dissected. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture, and samples of the liver, kidney, spleen, muscle, and tumor were removed from each animal. Radioactivity of each sample was measured with the Cobra Auto-gamma Counter (Packard, Downers Grove, Ill.). The percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g tissue) was calculated for each sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In a separate experiment, tumors were histologically analyzed to quantify apoptotic index induced by drug treatments. Groups of mice were treated with PG-TXL (100 mg eq./kg), C225 (50 mg/kg), or combination of PG-TXL (100 mg eq./kg) and C225 (50 mg/kg), respectively. Mice were killed at day 1 and day 4 after treatments, and the tumors were immediately excised and placed in neutral-buffered formalin. The tissues were then processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Apoptosis index was scored in coded slides by microscopic examination at 40&times; magnification. Five fields of normecrotic areas were randomly selected in each histological specimen, and in each field the number of apoptotic nuclei were recorded as numbers per 100 nuclei and were expressed as a percentage. The values were based on scoring 1500 nuclei obtained from 3 mice per time point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Results were as follows. The tissue distribution of 1:30 prep of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV at 48 hours after the injection of radiotracer in untreated control mice and in mice treated with PG-TXL (100 mg eq./kg) or C225 (50 mg/kg) 4 days before the injection of the radiotracer are presented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the y-axis represents IND %/g tissue. The bars along the x-axis from left to right represent blood, liver, kidney, spleen, muscle and tumor, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows tissue distribution of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in untreated control mice. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows distribution of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in mice treated with PG-TXL on day 4. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows distribution of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in mice treated with C225 on day 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Treatment with PG-TXL resulted in a highly significant increase in the uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in the tumor 4 days after drug injection (p&equals;0.0009). The percentage of injected dose (% IND) per gram of tumor increased from 6.14 to 10.76, a 75% increase. Treatment with C225, on the other hand, resulted in a significant decease in the uptake of the radiotracer in the tumor (p&equals;0.028). PG-TXL induced apoptosis in MDA-MB468 tumors was time dependent. At 1 day after drug treatment, a slight but non-significant increase of the radiotracer in the tumor was observed (p&equals;0.26). Combination therapy with PG-TXL and C225 also resulted in a significant increase in the uptake of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV at 4 days after treatment (p&equals;0.029, data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> To correlate the findings obtained with <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV to the apoptotic index obtained from a conventionally accepted standard, the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified histologically in tumor samples removed at different times after treatments. The data are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19, a</cross-reference> bar graph showing the percentage of apoptotic cells determined histologically. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> the y-axis represents the % apoptotic cells. The bars along the x-axis, from left to right, represent the control mice, and mice treated with: C225, 4d; PG-TXL, Id; PG-TXL 4d; and C225&plus;PG-TXL 4d, respectively. The correlation coefficiency (r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) was analyzed by a simple regression model. The resulting data indicate that the uptake of the radiotracer in the tumor was highly correlated to apoptotic index determined histologically with r<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>value of 0.77 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the y-axis represents the % IND per gram tumor; the x-axis represents the % apoptosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Gamma images of mice acquired at 48 hours after injection of the radiotracer in mice treated with PG-TXL 4 days prior to the injection of the radiotracer were obtained. The gamma imaging study allowed visualization of changes associated with drug treatment. The enhancement of the contrast in the tumor could be clearly visualized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Two tumors removed from each group of mice at the end of the gamma imaging X5 session were rapidly frozen, processed, and 8-&mgr;m sections were made. The sliced sections were fixed in cold acetone, dried, and exposed to a multipurpose storage phosphor screen for 10 days. A Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard Instrument Company, Inc., Meriden, Conn.) was used to obtain autoradiographic images. The radioactivity at selected field of view is expressed as digital light unit per millimeter square (DLU/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> DNA fragmentation was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-uridine nick end labeling (TUNEL) using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer provided protocol (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Frozen tissue sections (8 &mgr;m) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (methanol-free) for 10 minutes at room temperature. The sections were washed with PBS two times (5 minutes each) and incubated with equilibration buffer (Promega) for 10 minutes at room temperature. The equilibration buffer was removed and reaction buffer containing equilibration buffer, nucleotide mix, and TdT enzyme was added to the tissue. Slides were incubated for 1 hour at 37&deg; C. in the dark. The TUNEL reaction was terminated by immersing the slides in 2&times; SSC (17.5 g of NaCl and 8.8 g of sodium citrate, 1 liter H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, pH 7.0) for 15 minutes. The slides were washed three times (5 minutes each) to remove unincorporated fluorescein-dUTP. To prevent photobleaching, Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, Calif.) was used to mount cover slips. Images were recorded using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Melville, N.Y.) with 520 nm filter and 20&times; object lens. Apoptotic cells per slide view were quantified by AAB colony counting software (Advanced American Biotechnology, Fullerton, Calif.) and expressed as number per field of view (0.016 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The intratumoral distribution of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in tumors of untreated control mice and mice 4 days after treatments with PG-TXL, C225, or both drugs combined were compared. Radioactivity was localized mainly in the periphery of the tumor in control mice. There was little activity in the central zone of the tumor. When the mice were treated with PG-TXL, the activity was concentrated more in the central area of the tumor. On the other hand, treatment with C225 alone caused reduced distribution of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV in the peripheral zone of the tumor as compared to controls. Combined PG-TXL and C225 therapy caused similar intratumoral distribution pattern of <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV as those treated with PG-TXL alone. The data confirm that treatment with PG-TXL alone or combined PG-TXL and C225 caused increased apoptosis, whereas treatment with C225 alone caused reduced apoptotic response. The findings also underscore that tumors are heterogeneous, as are their responses to treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> To further confirm that the distribution of radioactivity or <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV within MB-468 tumors corresponds to distribution of apoptotic cells, the same slides used for autoradiographic studies were stained with TUNEL to visualize the intratumoral distribution of apoptotic cells. The &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in autoradiographs of tumors co-localized with strong, positive TUNEL staining, and the &ldquo;cold spots&rdquo; co-localized with weak TUNEL staining. Even the boundary between &ldquo;hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold&rdquo; area in the autoradiographs corresponded to distinguishable areas of strong and weak stains in the TUNEL stained slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Quantitative analysis demonstrated significant correlation (r&equals;0.71, p&equals;0.0001) between radioactivity in autoradiographs and the corresponding fluorescent intensity in the TUNEL stained slide. Results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a graph showing the correlation between radioactivity measured from phosphors screen images (DLU/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>; y-axis) and apoptotic index determined from TUNEL assay (&num; Apoptotic Cells/Field; x-axis). These data further support that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In-DTPA-PEG-AV can be used to measure tumor apoptosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The foregoing data demonstrate, among other things, that <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>n-DTPA-PEG-AV and similar conjugates may be used to visualize apoptosis in cells and are potentially a useful tool in non-invasive assessment of early responses after chemo- and radiotherapy. Most chemotherapeutic drugs exert their antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis, and recent data suggest that early cell death may be an important predictor of the success of chemotherapy. As such, being able to noninvasively assess apoptosis using the novel conjugates of the invention will provide highly useful information to the physician, allowing evaluation of early treatment responses and better planning and monitoring of treatment of a patient. </paragraph>
