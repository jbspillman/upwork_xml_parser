<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of the invention is ovarian cancer, including diagnosis, characterization, management, and therapy of ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ovarian cancer is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in populations around the world. Ovarian cancer is classified, on the basis of clinical and pathological features, in three groups, namely epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC; &gt;90% of ovarian cancer in Western countries), germ cell tumors (circa 2-3% of ovarian cancer), and stromal ovarian cancer (circa 5% of ovarian cancer; Ozols et al, 1997<highlight><italic>, Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology, </italic></highlight>5th ed., DeVita et al, Eds. pp. 1502). Relative to EOC, germ cell tumors and stromal ovarian cancers are more easily detected and treated at an early stage, translating into higher/better survival rates for patients afflicted with these two types of ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are numerous types of ovarian tumors, some of which are benign, and others of which are malignant. Treatment (including non-treatment) options and predictions of patient outcome depend on accurate classification of the ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancers are named according to the type of cells from which the cancer is derived and whether the ovarian cancer is benign or malignant. Recognized histological tumor types include, for example, serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell tumors. In addition, ovarian cancers are classified according to recognized grade and stage scales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In grade I, the tumor tissue is well differentiated from normal ovarian tissue. In grade II, tumor tissue is moderately well differentiated. In grade III, the tumor tissue is poorly differentiated from normal tissue, and this grade correlates with a less favorable prognosis than grades I and II. Stage I is generally confined within the capsule surrounding one (stage IA) or both (stage IB) ovaries, although in some stage I (i.e. stage IC) cancers, malignant cells may be detected in ascites, in peritoneal rinse fluid, or on the surface of the ovaries. Stage II involves extension or metastasis of the tumor from one or both ovaries to other pelvic structures. In stage IIA, the tumor extends or has metastasized to the uterus, the fallopian tubes, or both. Stage IIB involves extension of the tumor to the pelvis. Stage IIC is stage IIA or IIB in which malignant cells may be detected in ascites, in peritoneal rinse fluid, or on the surface of the ovaries. In stage III, the tumor comprises at least one malignant extension to the small bowel or the omentum, has formed extrapelvic peritoneal implants of microscopic (stage IIIA) or macroscopic (&lt;2 centimeter diameter, stage IIIB; &gt;2 centimeter diameter, stage IIIC) size, or has metastasized to a retroperitoneal or inguinal lymph node (an alternate indicator of stage IIIC). In stage IV, distant (i.e. non-peritoneal) metastases of the tumor can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The durations of the various stages of ovarian cancer are not presently known, but are believed to be at least about a year each (Richart et al, 1969<highlight><italic>, Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. </italic></highlight>105:386). Prognosis declines with increasing stage designation. For example, 5-year survival rates for patients diagnosed with stage I, II, III, and IV ovarian cancer are 80%, 57%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Despite being the third most prevalent gynecological cancer, ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among those afflicted with gynecological cancers. The disproportionate mortality of ovarian cancer is attributable to a substantial absence of symptoms among those afflicted with early-stage ovarian cancer and to difficulty diagnosing ovarian cancer at an early stage. Patients afflicted with ovarian cancer most often present with non-specific complaints, such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary tract symptoms, lower abdominal pain, and generalized abdominal distension. These patients rarely present with paraneoplastic symptoms or with symptoms which clearly indicate their affliction. Presently, less than about 40% of patients afflicted with ovarian cancer present with stage I or stage II. Management of ovarian cancer would be significantly enhanced if the disease could be detected at an earlier stage, when treatments are much more generally efficacious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Ovarian cancer may be diagnosed, in part, by collecting a routine medical history from a patient and by performing physical examination, x-ray examination, and chemical and hematological studies on the patient. Hematological tests which may be indicative of ovarian cancer in a patient include analyses of serum levels of proteins designated CA125 and DF3 and plasma levels of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Palpation of the ovaries and ultrasound techniques (particularly including endovaginal ultrasound and color Doppler flow ultrasound techniques) can aid detection of ovarian tumors and differentiation of ovarian cancer from benign ovarian cysts. However, a definitive diagnosis of ovarian cancer typically requires performing exploratory laparotomy of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Potential tests for the detection of ovarian cancer (e.g., screening, reflex or monitoring) may be characterized by a number of factors. The &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; of an assay refers to the probability that the test will yield a positive result in an individual afflicted with ovarian cancer. The &ldquo;specificity&rdquo; of an assay refers to the probability that the test will yield a negative result in an individual not afflicted with ovarian cancer. The &ldquo;positive predictive value&rdquo; (PPV) of an assay is the ratio of true positive results (i.e. positive assay results for patients afflicted with ovarian cancer) to all positive results (i.e. positive assay results for patients afflicted with ovarian cancer &plus;positive assay results for patients not afflicted with ovarian cancer). It has been estimated that in order for an assay to be an appropriate population-wide screening tool for ovarian cancer the assay must have a PPV of at least about 10% (Rosenthal et al, 1998<highlight><italic>, Sem. Oncol. </italic></highlight>25:315-325). It would thus be desirable for a screening assay for detecting ovarian cancer in patients to have a high sensitivity and a high PPV. Monitoring and reflex tests would also require appropriate specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Owing to the cost, limited sensitivity, and limited specificity of known methods of detecting ovarian cancer, screening is not presently performed for the general population. In addition, the need to perform laparotomy in order to diagnose ovanan cancer in patients who screen positive for indications of ovarian cancer limits the desirability of population-wide screening, such that a PPV even greater than 10% would be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Prior use of serum CA125 level as a diagnostic marker gene for ovarian cancer indicated that this method exhibited insufficient specificity for use as a general screening method. Use of a refined algorithm for interpreting CA125 levels in serial retrospective samples obtained from patients improved the specificity of the method without shifting detection of ovarian cancer to an earlier stage (Skakes, 1995<highlight><italic>, Cancer </italic></highlight>76:2004). Screening for LPA to detect gynecological cancers including ovarian cancer exhibited a sensitivity of about 96% and a specificity of about 89%. However, CA125-based screening methods and LPA-based screening methods are hampered by the presence of CA125 and LPA, respectively, in the serum of patients afflicted with conditions other than ovarian cancer. For example, serum CA125 levels are known to be associated with menstruation, pregnancy, gastrointestinal and hepatic conditions such as colitis and cirrhosis, pericarditis, renal disease, and various non-ovarian malignancies. Serum LPA is known, for example, to be affected by the presence of non-ovarian gynecological malignancies. A screening method having a greater specificity for ovarian cancer than the current screening methods for CA125 and LPA could provide a population-wide screening for early stage ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Presently greater than about 60% of ovarian cancers diagnosed in patients are stage III or stage IV cancers. Treatment at these stages is largely limited to cytoreductive surgery (when feasible) and chemotherapy, both of which aim to slow the spread and development of metastasized tumor. Substantially all late stage ovarian cancer patients currently undergo combination chemotherapy as primary treatment, usually a combination of a platinum compound and a taxane. Median survival for responding patients is about one year. Combination chemotherapy involving agents such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, hexamethylmelamine, paclitaxel, and methotrexate may improve survival rates in these groups, relative to single-agent therapies. Various recently-developed chemotherapeutic agents and treatment regimens have also demonstrated usefulness for treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. For example, use of the topoisomerase I inhibitor topectan, use of amifostine to minimize chemotherapeutic side effects, and use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients having peritoneally implanted tumors have demonstrated at least limited utility. Presently, however, the 5-year survival rate for patients afflicted with stage III ovarian cancer is 25%, and the survival rate for patients afflicted with stage IV ovarian cancer is 8%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In summary, the earlier ovarian cancer is detected, the aggressiveness of therapeutic intervention and the side effects associated with therapeutic intervention are minimized. More importantly, the earlier the cancer is detected, the survival rate and quality of life of ovarian cancer patients is enhanced. Thus, a pressing need exists for methods of detecting ovarian cancer as early as possible. There also exists a need for methods of detecting recurrence of ovarian cancer as well as methods for predicting and monitoring the efficacy of treatment. The present invention satisfies these needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to methods of assessing whether a patient is afflicted with or has higher than normal risk for developing ovanan cancer. The methods comprise the step of comparing the level of expression of an ovarian cancer marker gene (hereinafter &ldquo;marker gene&rdquo;) in a patient sample with the normal level of expression of the marker gene in a control sample, e.g, a sample from a subject without ovarian cancer. A significantly altered (i.e., under or over) expression of the marker gene by the patient relative to the normal expression by the control subject is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer or has higher than normal risk of developing ovarian cancer. In preferred embodiments, the expression of a marker gene by a patient is compared to the averaged expression level of the marker gene amongst a plurality of control subjects. The number of control subjects may be 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one method, the marker gene(s) are preferably selected such that the positive predictive value of the method is at least about 10%. Also preferred are embodiments of the method wherein the marker gene is under- or over-expressed by at least two-fold in at least about 20% of stage I ovarian cancer patients, stage 1I ovarian cancer patients, stage III ovarian cancer patients, stage IV ovarian cancer patients, grade I ovarian cancer patients, grade II ovarian cancer patients, grade III ovarian cancer patients, epithelial ovarian cancer patients, stromal ovarian cancer patients, germ cell ovarian cancer patients, malignant ovarian cancer patients, benign ovarian patients, serous neoplasm ovarian cancer patients, mucinous neoplasm ovarian cancer patients, endometrioid neoplasm ovarian cancer patients and/or clear cell neoplasm ovarian cancer patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the methods of the present invention, the sample comprises cells or tissues obtained from a patient. In another embodiment, the patient sample comprises an ovary-associated body fluid. Such fluids include, for example, blood fluids, lymph, ascitic fluids, gynecological fluids, cystic fluids, urine, and fluids collected by peritoneal rinsing. In another embodiment, the patient sample comprises cells obtained from the patient, wherein the cells may be found in a fluid selected from the group consisting of a fluid collected by peritoneal rinsing, a fluid collected by uterine rinsing, a uterine fluid, a uterine exudate, a pleural fluid, and an ovarian exudate. In another embodiment, the patient sample is in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Table 1 lists the marker genes of the present invention. The marker genes are over-expressed by ovarian cancer cells relative to normal ovarian cells. The table provides, where available, the name(s) of the marker gene (&ldquo;Gene Name&rdquo;); the identifier(s) of one or more IMAGE clones having an insert that comprises a partial or complete eDNA copy of the marker gene (&ldquo;Clone ID&rdquo;); the accession number(s) of one or more GenBank entnes that describe the marker gene and provide a part or the whole of its cDNA sequence and/or amino acid sequence (&ldquo;Acc. No.&rdquo;); and the GI number(s) of one or more GenBank entries of the marker gene&apos;s partial or complete cDNA sequence (&ldquo;Nuc ID(GI)&rdquo;). The information in the GenBank entries can be obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using, for example, its Entrez on-line databases (see bttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the methods of the present invention, the level of expression of the marker gene in a sample can be assessed, for example, by detecting the presence in the sample of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> a protein encoded by the marker gene, or a polypeptide, or a fragment comprising the protein (e.g. using a reagent, such as an antibody, an antibody derivative, or a single chain antibody, which binds specifically with the protein or a fragment thereof) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> a metabolite which is produced directly (i.e., catalyzed) or indirectly by a protein encoded by the marker gene; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a polynucleotide (e.g. an mRNA, hnRNA, cDNA) produced by or derived from the expression of the marker gene, or a fragment of the polynucleotide (e.g. by contacting polynucleotides obtained or derived from the sample with a substrate having affixed thereto a nucleic acid comprising the marker gene sequence or a portion of such sequence). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention are particularly useful for further diagnosing patients with an identified pelvic mass or symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. The methods of the present invention may therefore be used to diagnose ovarian cancer or its precursors. The methods of the present invention can also be of particular use with patients having an enhanced risk of developing ovarian cancer (e.g., patients having a familial history of ovarian cancer, patients identified as having a mutant oncogene, and patients at least about 50 years of age), in providing early detection of ovarian cancer. The methods of the present invention may further be of particular use in monitoring the efficacy of treatment of an ovarian cancer patient (e.g. the efficacy of chemotherapy). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention may be performed by assessing the expression of a plurality (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 or more) of ovarian cancer marker genes. According to a method involving a plurality of marker genes, the level of expression in a patient sample of each of a plurality of marker genes, including at least one that is selected from the marker genes listed in Table 1, is compared with the normal level of expression of each of the plurality of marker genes in samples of the same type obtained from control subjects, i.e., human subjects not afflicted with ovarian cancer. A significantly altered, preferably increased, level of expression in the patient sample of one or more of the marker genes, or some combination thereof, relative to those marker genes&apos; expression levels in samples from control subjects, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with or has a higher than normal risk for developing ovarian cancer. The methods of the present invention may be practiced using one or more marker genes of the invention in combination with one or more known ovarian cancer marker genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In a preferred method of assessing whether a patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer (e.g., new detection (&ldquo;screening&rdquo;), detection of recurrence, reflex testing), the method comprises comparing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> a) the level of expression of one or several ovarian cancer marker genes in a patient sample, wherein at least one such gene is selected from the marker genes of Table 1 and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> b) the normal level of expression of the same marker gene(s) in a sample from a control subject having no ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A significantly higher expression of one or more marker genes in the patient sample relative to the normal expression levels in the sample from the control subject is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention further include a method of assessing the efficacy of a therapy in inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient. This method comprises comparing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> a) expression of one or several ovarian marker genes in a first sample obtained from the patient, prior to providing at least a portion of the therapy to the patient, wherein at least one such marker gene is selected from the marker genes of Table 1 and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> b) expression of the same marker gene(s) in a second sample obtained from the patient following provision of the portion of the therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A significantly lower expression of one or several of the marker genes in the second sample, relative to the first sample, is an indication that the therapy is efficacious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in this method the &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; may be any therapy for treating ovarian cancer including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, radiation therapy and surgical removal of tissue. Thus, the methods of the invention may be used to evaluate a patient before, during and after therapy, for example, to evaluate the reduction in tumor burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore further comprises a method for monitoring the progression of ovarian cancer in a patient, the method comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> a) detecting in a patient sample at a first time point, the expression of one or several ovarian cancer marker genes, wherein at least one such marker gene is selected from the marker genes listed in Table 1; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> b) repeating step a) with a patient sample obtained at a subsequent point in time; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> c) comparing the level of expression detected in steps a) and b), and therefrom monitoring the progression of ovarian cancer in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A significantly higher expression of one or several of the marker genes in the subsequent point in time, relative to the first time point, is an indication that the ovarian cancer has progressed. Conversely, a significantly lower expression of one or several of the marker genes in the subsequent point in time is an indication that the ovarian cancer has regressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a method for assessing the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer, the method comprising comparing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> a) the level of expression of one or several ovarian cancer marker genes in a patient sample, wherein at least one such marker gene is selected from the marker genes listed in Table 1, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> b) the level of expression of the same marker gene(s) in a sample from a control subject having ovarian cancer which is indolent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A significantly higher expression of one or more marker genes in the patient sample, relative to the expression level in the control subject sample, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with an aggressive ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a method for assessing the indolence of ovarian cancer, the method comprising comparing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> a) the level of expression of one or several ovarian cancer marker genes in a patient sample, wherein at least one such marker gene is selected from the marker genes listed in Table 1, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> b) the level of expression of the same marker gene(s) in a sample from a control subject having an aggressive ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A significantly lower expression of one or more marker genes in the patient sample, relative to the expression level in the control subject sample, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with an indolent ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present invention further includes a method for determining whether ovarian cancer has metastasized or is likely to metastasize in the future, the method comprising comparing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> a) the level of expression of one or several ovarian cancer marker genes in a patent sample, wherein at least one such marker gene is selected from the marker genes of Table I and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> b) the level of expression of the same marker gene(s) in a sample from a control subject having non-metastasized ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A significantly lower expression of one or more marker genes in the patient sample, relative to the expression level in the control subject sample, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer that has metastasized or is likely to metastasize in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a method for determining whether ovarian cancer has not metastasized or is not likely to metastasize in the future, the method comprising comparing: </paragraph>

It has been discovered that the over-expression of individual marker genes and combinations of marker genes described herein correlates with the presence of ovarian cancer in a patient. Methods are provided for detecting the occurrence of ovarian cancer in a patient, the absence of ovarian cancer in a patient, the stage of an ovarian cancer, the indolence or aggressiveness of the cancer, and with other characteristics of ovarian cancer that are relevant to prevention, diagnosis, characterization, and therapy of ovarian cancer in a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>

For example, a second polynucleotide may be a fragment of a gene that includes the first and second polynucleotides. The first and second polynucleotides are related in that they are components of the gene coding for a gene product, such as a protein or antibody. However, it is not necessary that the second polynucleotide comprises or overlaps with the first polynucleotide to be encompassed within the definition of &ldquo;corresponding to&rdquo; as used herein. For example, the first polynucleotide may be a fragment of a 3&prime; untranslated region of the second polynucleotide. The first and second polynucleotide may be fragments of a gene coding for a gene product. The second polynucleotide may be an exon of the gene while the first polynucleotide may be an intron of the gene. The term &ldquo;probe&rdquo; refers to any molecule which is capable of selectively binding to a specifically intended target molecule, for example a marker gene of the invention. Probes can either be synthesized by one skilled in the art, or derived from appropriate biological preparations. For purposes of detection of the target molecule, probes may be specifically designed to be labeled, as described herein. Examples of molecules that can be utilized as probes include, but are not limited to, proteins, antibodies, organic monomers, RNA, DNA, and cDNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;ovary-associated&rdquo; body fluid is a fluid which, when in the body of a patient, contacts or passes through ovarian cells or into which cells or proteins shed from ovarian cells e.g. ovarian epithelium, are capable of passing. Exemplary ovary-associated body fluids include blood fluids, lymph, ascites, gynecological fluids, cystic fluid, urine, and fluids collected by peritoneal rinsing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; level of expression of a marker gene is the level of expression of the marker gene in a human subject not afflicted with ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Over-expression&rdquo; of a marker gene refers to an at least two-fold greater expression of the marker gene than the normal level of expression of the marker gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The expression level of a marker gene in a test sample is &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; altered (e.g., higher or lower) from its expression level in a control sample if its expression level in the test sample is greater or less, respectively, than the control level by an amount greater than the standard error of the assay employed to assess expression, and preferably at least twice, and more preferably three, four, five or ten times that amount. In preferred embodiments, a &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; higher or lower expression level is at least two fold greater or less, respectively, than the control level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Higher&rdquo; is used interchangeably with &ldquo;increased.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Lower,&rdquo; &ldquo;decreased&rdquo; and &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; are used interchangeably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;promoter/regulatory sequence&rdquo; means a nucleic acid sequence which is required for expression of a gene product operably linked to the promoter/regulatory sequence. In some instances, this sequence may be the core promoter sequence and in other instances, this sequence may also include an enhancer sequence and other regulatory elements which are required for expression of the gene product. The promoter/regulatory sequence may, for example, be one which expresses the gene product in a tissue-specific manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; promoter is a nucleotide sequence which, when operably linked with a polynucleotide which encodes or specifies a gene product, causes the gene product to be produced in a living human cell under most or all physiological conditions of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;inducible&rdquo; promoter is a nucleotide sequence which, when operably linked with a polynucleotide which encodes or specifies a gene product, causes the gene product to be produced in a living human cell substantially only when an inducer which corresponds to the promoter is present in the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;tissue-specific&rdquo; promoter is a nucleotide sequence which, when operably linked with a polynucleotide which encodes or specifies a gene product, causes the gene product to be produced in a living human cell substantially only if the cell is a cell of the tissue type corresponding to the promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;transcribed polynucleotide&rdquo; is a polynucleotide (e.g. an RNA, a cDNA, or an analog of one of an RNA or cDNA) which is complementary to or homologous with all or a portion of a mature RNA made by transcription of a genomic DNA corresponding to a marker gene of the invention and normal post-transcriptional processing (e.g. splicing), if any, of the transcript. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Complementary&rdquo; refers to the broad concept of sequence complementarity between regions of two nucleic acid strands or between two regions of the same nucleic acid strand. It is known that an adenine residue of a first nucleic acid region is capable of forming specific hydrogen bonds (&ldquo;base pairing&rdquo;) with a residue of a second nucleic acid region which is antiparallel to the first region if the residue is thymine or uracil. Similarly, it is known that a cytosine residue of a first nucleic acid strand is capable of base pairing with a residue of a second nucleic acid strand which is antiparallel to the first strand if the residue is guanine. A first region of a nucleic acid is complementary to a second region of the same or a different nucleic acid if, when the two regions are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, at least one nucleotide residue of the first region is capable of base pairing with a residue of the second region. Preferably, the first region comprises a first portion and the second region comprises a second portion, whereby, when the first and second portions are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, at least about 50%, and preferably at least about 75%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the nucleotide residues of the first portion are capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the second portion. More preferably, all nucleotide residues of the first portion are capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the second portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Homologous&rdquo; as used herein, refers to nucleotide sequence similarity between two regions of the same nucleic acid strand or between regions of two different nucleic acid strands. When a nucleotide residue position in both regions is occupied by the same nucleotide residue, then the regions are homologous at that position. A first region is homologous to a second region if at least one nucleotide residue position of each region is occupied by the same residue. Homology between two regions is expressed in terms of the proportion of nucleotide residue positions of the two regions that are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. By way of example, a region having the nucleotide sequence 5&prime;-ATTGCC-3&prime; and a region having the nucleotide sequence 5&prime;-TATGGC-3&prime; share 50% homology. Preferably, the first region comprises a first portion and the second region comprises a second portion, whereby, at least about 50%, and preferably at least about 75%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the nucleotide residue positions of each of the portions are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. More preferably, all nucleotide residue positions of each of the portions are occupied by the same nucleotide residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A marker gene is &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; to a substrate if it is covalently or non-covalently associated with the substrate such the substrate can be rinsed with a fluid (e.g. standard saline citrate, pH 7.4) without a substantial fraction of the marker gene dissociating from the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;naturally-occurring&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g. encodes a natural protein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Ovarian cancer is &ldquo;inhibited&rdquo; if at least one symptom of the cancer is alleviated, terminated, slowed, or prevented. As used herein, ovarian cancer is also &ldquo;inhibited&rdquo; if recurrence or metastasis of the cancer is reduced, slowed, delayed, or prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A kit is any manufacture (e.g. a package or container) comprising at least one reagent, e.g. a probe, for specifically detecting a marker gene of the invention. The manufacture is preferably promoted, distributed, or sold as a unit for performing the methods of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Description </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based, in part, on identification of marker genes which are over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells than they are in normal (i.e. non-cancerous) ovarian cells. The marker genes of the invention correspond to nucleic acid and polypeptide molecules which can be detected in one or both of normal and cancerous ovarian cells. The presence, absence, or level of expression of one or more of these marker genes in ovarian cells is herein correlated with the cancerous state of the tissue. In particular the level of expression of a marker gene in Table 1 is increased in ovarian cancer cells relative to expression in normal cells. The invention thus includes compositions, kits, and methods for assessing the cancerous state of ovarian cells (e.g. cells obtained from a human, cultured human cells, archived or preserved human cells and in vivo cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The compositions, kits, and methods of the invention have the following uses, among others: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> 1) assessing whether a patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> 2) assessing the stage of ovarian cancer in a human patient; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> 9) assessing the presence of ovarian cancer cells; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 10) assessing the efficacy of one or more test compounds for inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 11) assessing the efficacy of a therapy for inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> 12) monitoring the progression of ovarian cancer in a patient; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 13) selecting a composition or therapy for inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> 14) treating a patient afflicted with ovarian cancer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> 15) inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> 16) assessing the ovarian carcinogenic potential of a test compound; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> 17) inhibiting an ovarian cancer in a patient at risk for developing ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The invention thus includes a method of assessing whether a patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer, which includes assessing whether the patient has pre-metastasized ovarian cancer. This method comprises comparing the level of expression of a marker gene in a patient sample and the normal level of expression of the marker gene in a control, e.g., a non-ovarian cancer sample. A significant difference between the level of expression of the marker gene in the patient sample and the normal level is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer. The marker gene is selected from the group consisting of the marker genes listed in Table 1. Although one or more molecules corresponding to the marker genes listed in Table 1 may have been described by others, the significance of the level of expression of these marker genes with regard to the cancerous state of ovarian cells has not previously been recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The marker genes of Table 1, any marker gene or combination of marker genes listed in Table 1, as well as any known marker genes in combination with the marker genes set forth in Table 1A, may be used in the compositions, kits, and methods of the present invention. In general, it is preferable to use marker genes for which the difference between the level of expression of the marker gene in ovarian cancer cells and the level of expression of the same marker gene in normal ovarian cells is as great as possible. Although this difference can be as small as the limit of detection of the method for assessing expression of the marker gene, it is preferred that the difference be at least greater than the standard error of the assessment method, and preferably a difference of at least 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, 100-, 500-, 1000-fold or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that certain marker genes correspond to proteins which are secreted from ovarian cells (i.e. one or both of normal and cancerous cells) to the extracellular space surrounding the cells. These marker genes are preferably used in certain embodiments of the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention, owing to the fact that the protein corresponding to each of these marker genes can be detected in an ovary-associated body fluid sample, which may be more easily collected from a human patient than a tissue biopsy sample. In addition, preferred in vivo techniques for detection of a protein corresponding to a marker gene of the invention include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against the protein. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker gene whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Although not every marker gene corresponding to a secreted protein is indicated as such, it is a simple matter for the skilled artisan to determine whether any particular marker gene corresponds to a secreted protein. In order to make this determination, the protein corresponding to a marker gene is expressed in a test cell (e.g. a cell of an ovarian cell line), extracellular fluid is collected, and the presence or absence of the protein in the extracellular fluid is assessed (e.g. using a labeled antibody which binds specifically with the protein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The following is an example of a method which can be used to detect secretion of a protein corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. About 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>293T cells are incubated at 37&deg; C. in wells containing growth medium (Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle&apos;s medium &lcub;DMEM&rcub; supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) under a 5% (v/v) CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 95% air atmosphere to about 60-70% confluence. The cells are then transfected using a standard transfection mixture comprising 2 micrograms of DNA comprising an expression vector encoding the protein and 10 microliters of LipofectAMINE&trade; (GIBCO/BRL Catalog no. 18342-012) per well. The transfection mixture is maintained for about 5 hours, and then replaced with fresh growth medium and maintained in an air atmosphere. Each well is gently rinsed twice with DMEM which does not contain methionine or cysteine (DMEM-MC; ICN Catalog no. 16-424-54). About 1 milliliter of DMEM-MC and about 50 microcuries of Trans-<highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S&trade; reagent (ICN Catalog no. 51006) are added to each well. The wells are maintained under the 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere described above and incubated at 37&deg; C. for a selected period. Following incubation, 150 microliters of conditioned medium is removed and centrifuged to remove floating cells and debris. The presence of the protein in the supernatant is an indication that the protein is secreted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Examples of ovary-associated body fluids include blood fluids (e.g. whole blood, blood serum, blood having platelets removed therefrom, etc.), lymph, ascitic fluids, gynecological fluids (e.g. ovarian, fallopian, and uterine secretions, menses, vaginal douching fluids, fluids used to rinse ovarian cell samples, etc.), cystic fluid, urine, and fluids collected by peritoneal rinsing (e.g. fluids applied and collected during laparoscopy or fluids instilled into and withdrawn from the peritoneal cavity of a human patient). In these embodiments, the level of expression of the marker gene can be assessed by assessing the amount (e.g. absolute amount or concentration) of the marker gene in an ovary-associated body fluid obtained from a patient. The fluid can, of course, be subjected to a variety of well-known post-collection preparative and storage techniques (e.g. storage, freezing, ultrafiltration, concentration, evaporation, centrifigation, etc.) prior to assessing the amount of the marker gene in the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Many ovary-associated body fluids (i.e. usually excluding urine) can have ovarian cells, e.g. ovarian epithelium, therein, particularly when the ovarian cells are cancerous, and, more particularly, when the ovarian cancer is metastasizing. Cell-containing fluids which can contain ovarian cancer cells include, but are not limited to, peritoneal ascites, fluids collected by peritoneal rinsing, fluids collected by uterine rinsing, uterine fluids such as uterine exudate and menses, pleural fluid, and ovarian exudates. Thus, the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention can be used to detect expression of marker genes corresponding to proteins having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of cells which express it. Examples of such proteins are indicated in the Table I herein. Although not every protein having at least one cell-surface portion is indicated in Table 1, it is a simple matter for the skilled artisan to determine whether the protein corresponding to any particular marker gene comprises a cell-surface protein. For example, immunological methods may be used to detect such proteins on whole cells, or well known computer-based sequence analysis methods (e.g. the SIGNALP program; Nielsen et al., 1997<highlight><italic>, Protein Engineering </italic></highlight>10:1-6) may be used to predict the presence of at least one extracellular domain (i.e. including both secreted proteins and proteins having at least one cell-surface domain). Expression of a marker gene corresponding to a protein having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of a cell which expresses it may be detected without necessarily lysing the cell (e.g. using a labeled antibody which binds specifically with a cell-surface domain of the protein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Expression of a marker gene of the invention may be assessed by any of a wide variety of well known methods for detecting expression of a transcribed molecule or its corresponding protein. Non-limiting examples of such methods include immunological methods for detection of secreted, cell-surface, cytoplasmic, or nuclear proteins, protein purification methods, protein function or activity assays, nucleic acid hybridization methods, nucleic acid reverse transcription methods, and nucleic acid amplification methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, expression of a marker gene is assessed using an antibody (e.g. a radio-labeled, chromophore-labeled, fluorophore-labeled, or enzyme-labeled antibody), an antibody derivative (e.g. an antibody conjugated with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein-ligand pair &lcub;e.g. biotin-streptavidin&rcub;), or an antibody fragment (e.g. a single-chain antibody, an isolated antibody hypervariable domain, etc.) which binds specifically with a protein corresponding to the marker gene, such as the protein encoded by the open reading frame corresponding to the marker gene or such a protein which has undergone all or a portion of its normal post-translational modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, expression of a marker gene is assessed by preparing mRNA/cDNA (i.e. a transcribed polynucleotide) from cells in a patient sample, and by hybridizing the mRNA/cDNA with a reference polynucleotide which is a complement of a polynucleotide comprising the marker gene, and fragments thereof. cDNA can, optionally, be amplified using any of a variety of polymerase chain reaction methods prior to hybridization with the reference polynucleotide; preferably, it is not amplified. Expression of one or more marker genes can likewise be detected using quantitative PCR to assess the level of expression of the marker gene(s). Alternatively, any of the many known methods of detecting mutations or variants (e g. single nucleotide polymorphisms, deletions, etc.) of a marker gene of the invention may be used to detect occurrence of a marker gene in a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In a related embodiment, a mixture of transcribed polynucleotides obtained from the sample is contacted with a substrate having fixed thereto a polynucleotide complementary to or homologous with at least a portion (e.g. at least 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 500, or more nucleotide residues) of a marker gene of the invention. If polynucleotides complementary to or homologous with are differentially detectable on the substrate (e.g. detectable using different chromophores or fluorophores, or fixed to different selected positions), then the levels of expression of a plurality of marker genes can be assessed simultaneously using a single substrate (e.g. a &ldquo;gene chip&rdquo; microarray of polynucleotides fixed at selected positions). When a method of assessing marker gene expression is used which involves hybridization of one nucleic acid with another, it is preferred that the hybridization be performed under stringent hybridization conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Because the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention rely on detection of a difference in expression levels of one or more marker genes of the invention, it is preferable that the level of expression of the marker gene is significantly greater than the minimum detection limit of the method used to assess expression in at least one of normal ovarian cells and cancerous ovarian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> It is understood that by routine screening of additional patient samples using one or more of the marker genes of the invention, it will be realized that certain of the marker genes are over- or under-expressed in cancers of various types, including specific ovarian cancers, as well as other cancers such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, etc. For example, it will be confirmed that some of the marker genes of the invention are over- or under-expressed in most (i.e. 50% or more) or substantially all (i.e. 80% or more) of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, it will be confirmed that certain of the marker genes of the invention are associated with ovarian cancer of various stages (i.e. stage I, II, III, and IV ovarian cancers, as well as subclassifications IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, using the FIGO Stage Grouping system for primary carcinoma of the ovary; 1987<highlight><italic>, Am. J. Obstet Gynecol. </italic></highlight>156:236), of various histologic subtypes (e.g. serous, mucinous, endometroid, and clear cell subtypes, as well as subclassifications and alternate classifications adenocarcinoma, papillary adenocarcinoma, papillary cystadenocarcinoma, surface papillary carcinoma, malignant adenofibroma, cystadenofibroma, adenocarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, adenoacanthoma, endometrioid stromal sarcoma, mesodermal (M&uuml;llerian) mixed tumor, mesonephroid tumor, malignant carcinoma, Brenner tumor, mixed epithelial tumor, and undifferentiated carcinoma, using the WHO/FIGO system for classification of malignant ovarian tumors; Scully, <highlight><italic>Atlas of Tumor Pathology, </italic></highlight>3d senes, Washington D.C.), and various grades (i.e. grade I &lcub;well differentiated&rcub;, grade II &lcub;moderately well differentiated&rcub;, and grade III &lcub;poorly differentiated from surrounding normal tissue&rcub;). In addition, as a greater number of patient samples are assessed for expression of the marker genes of the invention and the outcomes of the individual patients from whom the samples were obtained are correlated, it will also be confirmed that altered expression of certain of the marker genes of the invention are strongly correlated with malignant cancers and that altered expression of other marker genes of the invention are strongly correlated with benign tumors. The compositions, kits, and methods of the invention are thus useful for characterizing one or more of the stage, grade, histological type, and benign/malignant nature of ovarian cancer in patients. In addition, these compositions, kits, and methods can be used to detect and differentiate epithelial, stromal, and germ cell ovarian cancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> When the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention are used for characterizing one or more of the stage, grade, histological type, and benign/malignant nature of ovarian cancer in a patient, it is preferred that the marker gene or panel of marker genes of the invention is selected such that a positive result is obtained in at least about 20%, and preferably at least about 40%, 60%, or 80%, and more preferably in substantially all patients afflicted with an ovarian cancer of the corresponding stage, grade, histological type, or benign/malignant nature. Preferably, the marker gene or panel of marker genes of the invention is selected such that a PPV of greater than about 10% is obtained for the general population (more preferably coupled with an assay specificity greater than 99.5%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When a plurality of marker genes of the invention are used in the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention, the level of expression of each marker gene in a patient sample can be compared with the normal level of expression of each of the plurality of marker genes in non-cancerous samples of the same type, either in a single reaction mixture (i.e. using reagents, such as different fluorescent probes, for each marker gene) or in individual reaction mixtures corresponding to one or more of the marker genes. In one embodiment, a significantly enhanced level of expression of more than one of the plurality of marker genes in the sample, relative to the corresponding normal levels, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer. In another embodiment, a significantly lower level of expression in the sample of each of the plurality of marker genes, relative to the corresponding normal levels, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer. In yet another embodiment, a significantly enhanced level of expression of one or more marks and a significantly lower level of expression of one or more marker genes in a sample relative to the corresponding normal levels, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with ovarian cancer. When a plurality of marker genes is used, it is preferred that 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, or 50 or more individual marker genes be used, wherein fewer marker genes are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In order to maximize the sensitivity of the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention (i.e. by interference attributable to cells of non-ovarian origin in a patient sample), it is preferable that the marker gene of the invention used therein be a marker gene which has a restricted tissue distribution, e.g. normally not expressed in a non-epithelial tissue, and more preferably a marker gene which is normally not expressed in a non-ovarian tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Only a small number of marker genes are known to be associated with ovarian cancers (e.g. AKT2, Ki-RAS, ERBB2, c-MYC, RB1, and TP53; Lynch, supra). These marker genes are not, of course, included among the marker genes of the invention, although they may be used together with one or more marker genes of the invention in a panel of marker genes, for example. It is well known that certain types of genes, such as oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, growth factor-like genes, protease-like genes, and protein kinase-like genes are often involved with development of cancers of various types. Thus, among the marker genes of the invention, use of those which correspond to proteins which resemble known proteins encoded by known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and those which correspond to proteins which resemble growth factors, proteases, and protein kinases are preferred. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention will be of particular utility to patients having an enhanced risk of developing ovarian cancer and their medical advisors. Patients recognized as having an enhanced risk of developing ovanan cancer include, for example, patients having a familial history of ovarian cancer, patients identified as having a mutant oncogene (i.e. at least one allele), and patients of advancing age (i.e. women older than about 50 or 60 years). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The level of expression of a marker gene in normal (i.e. non-cancerous) human ovarian tissue can be assessed in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, this normal level of expression is assessed by assessing the level of expression of the marker gene in a portion of ovarian cells which appears to be non-cancerous and by comparing this normal level of expression with the level of expression in a portion of the ovarian cells which is suspected of being cancerous. For example, when laparoscopy or other medical procedure, reveals the presence of a lump on one portion of a patient&apos;s ovary, but not on another portion of the same ovary or on the other ovary, the normal level of expression of a marker gene may be assessed using one or both or the non-affected ovary and a non-affected portion of the affected ovary, and this normal level of expression may be compared with the level of expression of the same marker gene in an affected portion (i.e. the lump) of the affected ovary. Alternately, and particularly as further information becomes available as a result of routine performance of the methods described herein, population-average values for normal expression of the marker genes of the invention may be used. In other embodiments, the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; level of expression of a marker gene may be determined by assessing expression of the marker gene in a patient sample obtained from a non-cancer-afflicted patient, from a patient sample obtained from a patient before the suspected onset of ovarian cancer in the patient, from archived patient samples, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The invention includes compositions, kits, and methods for assessing the presence of ovarian cancer cells in a sample (e.g. an archived tissue sample or a sample obtained from a patient). These compositions, kits, and methods are substantially the same as those described above, except that, where necessary, the compositions, kits, and methods are adapted for use with samples other than patient samples. For example, when the sample to be used is a parafinized, archived human tissue sample, it can be necessary to adjust the ratio of compounds in the compositions of the invention, in the kits of the invention, or the methods used to assess levels of marker gene expression in the sample. Such methods are well known in the art and within the skill of the ordinary artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The invention includes a kit for assessing the presence of ovarian cancer cells (e.g. in a sample such as a patient sample). The kit comprises a plurality of reagents, each of which is capable of binding specifically with a nucleic acid or polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Suitable reagents for binding with a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention include antibodies, antibody derivatives, antibody fragments, and the like. Suitable reagents for binding with a nucleic acid (e.g. a genomic DNA, an mRNA, a spliced mRNA, a cDNA, or the like) include complementary nucleic acids. For example, the nucleic acid reagents may include oligonucleotides (labeled or non-labeled) fixed to a substrate, labeled oligonucleotides not bound with a substrate, pairs of PCR primers, molecular beacon probes, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The kit of the invention may optionally comprise additional components useful for performing the methods of the invention. By way of example, the kit may comprise fluids (e.g. SSC buffer) suitable for annealing complementary nucleic acids or for binding an antibody with a protein with which it specifically binds, one or more sample compartments, an instructional material which describes performance of a method of the invention, a sample of normal ovarian cells, a sample of ovarian cancer cells, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a method of making an isolated hybridoma which produces an antibody useful for assessing whether patient is afflicted with an ovarian cancer. In this method, a protein corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or a fragment of the protein is isolated (e g. by purification from a cell in which it is expressed or by transcription and translation of a nucleic acid encoding the protein in vivo or in vitro using known methods). A vertebrate, preferably a mammal such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, or sheep, is immunized using the isolated protein or fragment thereof. The vertebrate may optionally (and preferably) be immunized at least one additional time with the isolated protein or fragment, so that the vertebrate exhibits a robust immune response to the protein. Splenocytes are isolated from the immunized vertebrate and fused with an immortalized cell line to form hybridomas, using any of a variety of methods well known in the art. Hybridomas formed in this manner are then screened using standard methods to identify one or more hybridomas which produce an antibody which specifically binds with the protein. The invention also includes hybridomas made by this method and antibodies made using such hybridomas. An antibody of the invention may also be used as a therapeutic agent for treating cancers, particularly ovarian cancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a method of assessing the efficacy of a test compound for inhibiting ovarian cancer cells. As described above, differences in the level of expression of the marker genes of the invention correlate with the cancerous state of ovarian cells. Although it is recognized that changes in the levels of expression of certain of the marker genes of the invention likely result from the cancerous state of ovarian cells, it is likewise recognized that changes in the levels of expression of other of the marker genes of the invention induce, maintain, and promote the cancerous state of those cells. Thus, compounds which inhibit an ovarian cancer in a patient will cause the level of expression of one or more of the marker genes of the invention to change to a level nearer the normal level of expression for that marker gene (ie. the level of expression for the marker gene in non-cancerous ovarian cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> This method thus comprises comparing expression of a marker gene in a first ovarian cell sample and maintained in the presence of the test compound and expression of the marker gene in a second ovarian cell sample and maintained in the absence of the test compound. A significant increase in the level of expression of a marker gene listed in Table 1, is an indication that the test compound inhibits ovarian cancer. The ovarian cell samples may, for example, be aliquots of a single sample of normal ovarian cells obtained from a patient, pooled samples of normal ovarian cells obtained from a patient, cells of a normal ovarian cell line, aliquots of a single sample of ovarian cancer cells obtained from a patient, pooled samples of ovarian cancer cells obtained from a patient, cells of an ovarian cancer cell line, or the like. In one embodiment, the samples are ovarian cancer cells obtained from a patient and a plurality of compounds known to be effective for inhibiting various ovarian cancers are tested in order to identify the compound which is likely to best inhibit the ovarian cancer in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> This method may likewise be used to assess the efficacy of a therapy for inhibiting ovarian cancer in a patient. In this method, the level of expression of one or more marker genes of the invention in a pair of samples (one subjected to the therapy, the other not subjected to the therapy) is assessed. As with the method of assessing the efficacy of test compounds, if the therapy induces a significant decrease in the level of expression of a marker gene listed in Table 1, then the therapy is efficacious for inhibiting ovarian cancer. As above, if samples from a selected patient are used in this method, then alternative therapies can be assessed in vitro in order to select a therapy most likely to be efficacious for inhibiting ovarian cancer in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As described herein, ovarian cancer in patients is associated with an increase in the level of expression of one or more marker genes listed Table 1. While, as discussed above, some of these changes in expression level result from occurrence of the ovarian cancer, others of these changes induce, maintain, and promote the cancerous state of ovarian cancer cells. Thus, ovarian cancer characterized by an increase in the level of expression of one or more marker genes listed in Table 1 can be inhibited by inhibiting expression of those marker genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Expression of a marker gene listed in Table 1 can be inhibited in a number of ways generally known in the art. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide can be provided to the ovarian cancer cells in order to inhibit transcription, translation, or both, of the marker gene(s). Alternately, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody, an antibody derivative, or an antibody fragment which specifically binds the protein corresponding to the marker gene, and operably linked with an appropriate promoter/regulator region, can be provided to the cell in order to generate intracellular antibodies which will inhibit the function or activity of the protein. The expression and/or function of a marker gene may also be inhibited by treating the ovarian cancer cell with a heterologous antibody or antibody derivative that specifically binds the protein corresponding to the marker gene. Using the methods described herein, a variety of molecules, particularly including molecules sufficiently small that they are able to cross the cell membrane, can be screened in order to identify molecules which inhibit expression of the marker gene(s). The compound so identified can be provided to the patient in order to inhibit expression of the marker gene(s) in the ovarian cancer cells of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As described above, the cancerous state of human ovarian cells is correlated with changes in the levels of expression of the marker genes of the invention. Thus, compounds which induce increased expression of one or more of the marker genes listed in Table 1 can induce ovarian cell carcinogenesis. The invention includes a method for assessing the human ovarian cell carcinogenic potential of a test compound. This method comprises maintaining separate aliquots of human ovarian cells in the presence and absence of the test compound. Expression of a marker gene of the invention in each of the aliquots is compared. A significant increase in the level of expression of a marker gene listed in Table 1 in the aliquot maintained in the presence of the test compound (relative to the aliquot maintained in the absence of the test compound) is an indication that the test compound possesses human ovarian cell carcinogenic potential. The relative carcinogenic potentials of various test compounds can be assessed by comparing the degree of enhancement or inhibition of the level of expression of the relevant marker genes, by comparing the number of marker genes for which the level of expression is enhanced or inhibited, or by comparing both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that correspond to a marker gene of the invention, including nucleic acids which encode a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or a portion of such a polypeptide. Isolated nucleic acids of the invention also include nucleic acid molecules sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify nucleic acid molecules that correspond to a marker gene of the invention, including nucleic acids which encode a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention, and fragments of such nucleic acid molecules, e g., those suitable for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term &ldquo;nucleic acid molecule&rdquo; is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid molecule. Preferably, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule comprises a protein-coding sequence and is free of sequences which naturally flank the coding sequence in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kB, 4 kB, 3 kB, 2 kB, 1 kB, 0.5 kB or 0.1 kB of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule, such as a eDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e g., a nucleic acid encoding a protein corresponding to a marker gene listed in one or more of Table 1, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information in the database records described herein. Using all or a portion of such nucleic acid sequences, nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., ed., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><italic>nd ed.</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA, or genomic DNA as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to all or a portion of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid encoding a protein which corresponds to a marker gene of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to a given nucleotide sequence is one which is sufficiently complementary to the given nucleotide sequence that it can hybridize to the given nucleotide sequence thereby forming a stable duplex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence, wherein the full length nucleic acid sequence comprises a marker gene of the invention or which encodes a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Such nucleic acids can be used, for example, as a probe or primer. The probe/primer typically is used as one or more substantially purified oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 7, preferably about 15, more preferably about 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, or 400 or more consecutive nucleotides of a nucleic acid of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be used to detect transcripts or genomic sequences corresponding to one or more marker genes of the invention. The probe comprises a label group attached thereto, e g., a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used as part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissues which mis-express the protein, such as by measuring levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein in a sample of cells from a subject, e g., detecting mRNA levels or determining whether a gene encoding the protein has been mutated or deleted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ, due to degeneracy of the genetic code, from the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids encoding a protein which corresponds to a marker gene of the invention, and thus encode the same protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In addition to the nucleotide sequences described in the GenBank and IMAGE Consortium database records described herein, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that DNA sequence polymorphisms that lead to changes in the amino acid sequence can exist within a population (e.g., the human population). Such genetic polymorphisms can exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. An allele is one of a group of genes which occur alternatively at a given genetic locus. In addition, it will be appreciated that DNA polymorphisms that affect RNA expression levels can also exist that may affect the overall expression level of that gene (e g, by affecting regulation or degradation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;allelic variant&rdquo; refers to a nucleotide sequence which occurs at a given locus or to a polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;gene&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant gene&rdquo; refer to nucleic acid molecules comprising an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Such natural allelic variations can typically result in 0.1-0.5% variance in the nucleotide sequence of a given gene. Alternative alleles can be identified by sequencing the gene of interest in a number of different individuals. This can be readily carried out by using hybridization probes to identify the same genetic locus in a variety of individuals. Any and all such nucleotide variations and resulting amino acid polymorphisms or variations that are the result of natural allelic variation and that do not alter the functional activity are intended to be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 550, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or to a nucleic acid encoding a protein corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridizes under stringent conditions&rdquo; is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences at least 75% (80%, 85%, preferably 90%) identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in sections 6.3.1-6.3.6 of <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989). A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions for annealing two single-stranded DNA each of which is at least about 100 bases in length and/or for annealing a single-stranded DNA and a single-stranded RNA each of which is at least about 100 bases in length, are hybridization in 6&times;sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&deg; C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65&deg; C. Further preferred hybridization conditions are taught in Lockhart, et al., Nature Biotechnology, Volume 14, 1996 August: 1675-1680; Breslauer, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. USA, Volume 83, 1986 June: 3746-3750; Van Ness, et al, Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 19, No. 19, 1991 September: 5143-5151; McGraw, et al., BioTechniques, Volume 8, No. 61990: 674-678; and Milner, et al, Nature Biotechnology, Volume 15, 1997 June: 537-541, all expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention that can exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that sequence changes can be introduced by mutation thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, without altering the biological activity of the protein encoded thereby. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; amino acid residues. A &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence without altering the biological activity, whereas an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are not conserved or only semi-conserved among homologs of various species may be non-essential for activity and thus would be likely targets for alteration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, amino acid residues that are conserved among the homologs of various species (e.g., murine and human) may be essential for activity and thus would not be likely targets for alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding a polypeptide of the invention that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such polypeptides differ in amino acid sequence from the naturally-occurring proteins which correspond to the marker genes of the invention, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, such a protein has an amino acid sequence that is at least about 40% identical, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98% identical to the amino acid sequence of one of the proteins which correspond to the marker genes of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a variant protein can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into 3s the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids of the invention, such that one or more amino acid residue substitutions, additions, or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A &ldquo;conservative amino acid substitution&rdquo; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), non-polar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., thr6onine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The present invention encompasses antisense nucleic acid molecules, i.e., molecules which are complementary to a sense nucleic acid of the invention, e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or complementary to an mRNA sequence corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Accordingly, an antisense nucleic acid of the invention can hydrogen bond to (i.e. anneal with) a sense nucleic acid of the invention. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire coding strand, or to only a portion thereof, e.g., all or part of the protein coding region (or open reading frame). An antisense nucleic acid molecule can also be antisense to all or part of a non-coding region of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The non-coding regions (&ldquo;5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated regions&rdquo;) are the 5&prime; and 3&prime; sequences which flank the coding region and are not translated into amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 or more nucleotides in length. An antisense nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. Examples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid include 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5&prime;-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine. Alternatively, the antisense nucleic acid can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been sub-cloned in an antisense orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest, described further in the following subsection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention are typically administered to a subject or generated in situ such that they hybridize with or bind to cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a selected marker gene of the invention to thereby inhibit expression of the marker gene, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. The hybridization can be by conventional nucleotide complementarity to form a stable duplex, or, for example, in the case of an antisense nucleic acid molecule which binds to DNA duplexes, through specific interactions in the major groove of the double helix. Examples of a route of administration of antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention includes direct injection at a tissue site or infusion of the antisense nucleic acid into an ovary-associated body fluid. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For example, for systemic administration, antisense molecules can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules can also be delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in which the antisense nucleic acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol II or pol III promoter are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> An antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be an &nequiv;-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An &agr;-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual &agr;-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>15:6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2&prime;-o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>15:6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>215:327-330). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses ribozymes. Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules with ribonuclease activity which are capable of cleaving a single-stranded nucleic acid, such as an mRNA, to which they have a complementary region. Thus, ribozymes (e g, hammerhead ribozymes as described in Haselhoff and Gerlach, 1988<highlight><italic>, Nature </italic></highlight>334:585-591) can be used to catalytically cleave mRNA transcripts to thereby inhibit translation of the protein encoded by the mRNA. A ribozyme having specificity for a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA corresponding to the marker gene. For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved (see Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,742). Alternatively, an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules (see, e.g., Bartel and Szostak, 1993<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>261:1411-1418). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses nucleic acid molecules which form triple helical structures. For example, expression of a polypeptide of the invention can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the gene encoding the polypeptide (e.g., the promoter and/or enhancer) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the gene in target cells. See generally Helene (1991) <highlight><italic>Anticancer Drug Des. </italic></highlight>6(6):569-84; Helene (1992) <highlight><italic>Ann. N.Y Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>660:27-36; and Maher (1992) <highlight><italic>Bioassays </italic></highlight>14(12):807-15. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g, the stability, hybridization, or solubility of the molecule. For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acids can be modified to generate peptide nucleic acids (see Hyrup et al, 1996<highlight><italic>, Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry </italic></highlight>4(1): 5-23). As used herein, the terms &ldquo;peptide nucleic acids&rdquo; or &ldquo;PNAs&rdquo; refer to nucleic acid mimics, e.g., DNA mimics, in which the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural nucleobases are retained. The neutral backbone of PNAs has been shown to allow for specific hybridization to DNA and RNA under conditions of low ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can be performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup et al (1996), supra; Perry-O&apos;Keefe et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>93:14670-675. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> PNAs can be used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. For example, PNAs can be used as antisense or antigene agents for sequence-specific modulation of gene expression by, e.g., inducing transcription or translation arrest or inhibiting replication. PNAs can also be used, e.g., in the analysis of single base pair mutations in a gene by, e.g., PNA directed PCR clamping; as artificial restriction enzymes when used in combination with other enzymes, e.g., S1 nucleases (Hyrup (1996), supra; or as probes or primers for DNA sequence and hybridization (Hyrup, 1996, supra; Perry-O&apos;Keefe et al, 1996<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>93:14670-675). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, PNAs can be modified, e.g., to enhance their stability or cellular uptake, by attaching lipophilic or other helper groups to PNA, by the formation of PNA-DNA chimeras, or by the use of liposomes or other techniques of drug delivery known in the art. For example, PNA-DNA chimeras can be generated which can combine the advantageous properties of PNA and DNA. Such chimeras allow DNA recognition enzymes, e.g., RNASE H and DNA polymerases, to interact with the DNA portion while the PNA portion would provide high binding affinity and specificity. PNA-DNA chimeras can be linked using linkers of appropriate lengths selected in terms of base stacking, number of bonds between the nucleobases, and orientation (Hyrup, 1996, supra). The synthesis of PNA-DNA chimeras can be performed as described in Hyrup (1996), supra, and Finn et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>24(17):3357-63. For example, a DNA chain can be synthesized on a solid support using standard phosphoramidite coupling chemistry and modified nucleoside analogs. Compounds such as 5&prime;-(4-methoxytrityl)amino-5&prime;-deoxy-thymidine phosphoramidite can be used as a link between the PNA and the 5&prime; end of DNA (Mag et al, 1989<highlight><italic>, Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>17:5973-88). PNA monomers are then coupled in a step-wise manner to produce a chimeric molecule with a 5&prime; PNA segment and a 3&prime; DNA segment (Finn et al, 1996<highlight><italic>, Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>24(17):3357-63). Alternatively, chimeric molecules can be synthesized with a 5&prime; DNA segment and a 3&prime; PNA segment (Peterser et al, 1975<highlight><italic>, Bioorganic Med. Chem. Lett. </italic></highlight>5:1119-11124). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide can include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al., 1989<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA </italic></highlight>86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al., 1987<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>84:648-652; PCT Publication No. WO 88/09810) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 89/10134). in addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (see, e.g., Krol et al., 1988<highlight><italic>, Bio/Techniques </italic></highlight>6:958-976) or intercalating agents (see, eg., Zon, 1988<highlight><italic>, Pharm. Res. </italic></highlight>5:539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide can be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes molecular beacon nucleic acids having at least one region which is complementary to a nucleic acid of the invention, such that the molecular beacon is useful for quantitating the presence of the nucleic acid of the invention in a sample. A &ldquo;molecular beacon&rdquo; nucleic acid is a nucleic acid comprising a pair of complementary regions and having a fluorophore and a fluorescent quencher associated therewith. The fluorophore and quencher are associated with different portions of the nucleic acid in such an orientation that when the complementary regions are annealed with one another, fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched by the quencher. When the complementary regions of the nucleic acid are not annealed with one another, fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched to a lesser degree. Molecular beacon nucleic acids are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,930. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> II. Isolated Proteins and Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated proteins which correspond to individual marker genes of the invention, and biologically active portions thereof, as well as polypeptide fragments suitable for use as immunogens to raise antibodies directed against a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. In one embodiment, the native polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, polypeptides corresponding to a marker gene of the invention are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; or &ldquo;purified&rdquo; protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language &ldquo;substantially free of cellular material&rdquo; includes preparations of protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, protein that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a &ldquo;contaminating protein&rdquo;). When the protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, or 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the protein is produced by chemical synthesis, it is preferably substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly such preparations of the protein have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the polypeptide of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Biologically active portions of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention include polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently identical to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the protein corresponding to the marker gene (e.g., the amino acid sequence listed in the GenBank and IMAGE Consortium database records described herein), which include fewer amino acids than the full length protein, and exhibit at least one activity of the corresponding full-length protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the corresponding protein. A biologically active portion of a protein of the invention can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100 or more amino acids in length. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of the native form of a polypeptide of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Preferred polypeptides have the amino acid sequence listed in the one of the GenBank and IMAGE Consortium database records described herein. Other useful proteins are substantially identical (e.g., at least about 40%, preferably 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99%) to one of these sequences and retain the functional activity of the protein of the corresponding naturally-occurring protein yet differ in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity &equals;&num; of identical positions/total &num; of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)&times;100). In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA </italic></highlight>90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul, et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score&equals;100, wordlength&equals;12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score&equals;50, wordlength&equals;3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al (1997) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Another preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, (1988) <highlight><italic>Comput Appl Biosci, </italic></highlight>4:11-7. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA algorithm as described in Pearson and Lipman (1988) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:2444-2448. When using the FASTA algorithm for comparing nucleotide or amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table can, for example, be used with a k-tuple value of 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, only exact matches are counted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides chimeric or fusion proteins corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. As used herein, a &ldquo;chimeric protein&rdquo; or &ldquo;fusion protein&rdquo; comprises all or part (preferably a biologically active part) of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention operably linked to a heterologous polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide other than the polypeptide corresponding to the marker gene). Within the fusion protein, the term &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; is intended to indicate that the polypeptide of the invention and the heterologous polypeptide are fused in-frame to each other. The heterologous polypeptide can be fused to the amino-terminus or the carboxyl-terminus of the polypeptide of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> One useful fusion protein is a GST fusion protein in which a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention is fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of a recombinant polypeptide of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the fusion protein contains a heterologous signal sequence at its amino terminus. For example, the native signal sequence of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be removed and replaced with a signal sequence from another protein. For example, the gp67 secretory sequence of the baculovirus envelope protein can be used as a heterologous signal sequence (Ausubel et al, ed., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, 1992). Other examples of eukaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). In yet another example, useful prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the phoA secretory signal (Sambrook et al. supra) and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech; Piscataway, N.J.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the fusion protein is an immunoglobulin fusion protein in which all or part of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention is fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a ligand (soluble or membrane-bound) and a protein on the surface of a cell (receptor), to thereby suppress signal transduction in vivo. The immunoglobulin fusion protein can be used to affect the bioavailability of a cognate ligand of a polypeptide of the invention. Inhibition of ligand/receptor interaction can be useful therapeutically, both for treating proliferative and differentiative disorders and for modulating (e.g. promoting or inhibiting) cell survival. Moreover, the immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce antibodies directed against a polypeptide of the invention in a subject, to purify ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of receptors with ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Chimeric and fusion proteins of the invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and re-amplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, eg, Ausubel et al, supra). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the polypeptide of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> A signal sequence can be used to facilitate secretion and isolation of the secreted protein or other proteins of interest. Signal sequences are typically characterized by a core of hydrophobic amino acids which are generally cleaved from the mature protein during secretion in one or more cleavage events. Such signal peptides contain processing sites that allow cleavage of the signal sequence from the mature proteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. Thus, the invention pertains to the described polypeptides having a signal sequence, as well as to polypeptides from which the signal sequence has been proteolytically cleaved (i.e., the cleavage products). In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal sequence can be operably linked in an expression vector to a protein of interest, such as a protein which is ordinarily not secreted or is otherwise difficult to isolate. The signal sequence directs secretion of the protein, such as from a eukaryotic host into which the expression vector is transformed, and the signal sequence is subsequently or concurrently cleaved. The protein can then be readily purified from the extracellular medium by art recognized methods. Alternatively, the signal sequence can be linked to the protein of interest using a sequence which facilitates purification, such as with a GST domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The present invention also pertains to variants of the polypeptides corresponding to individual marker genes of the invention. Such variants have an altered amino acid sequence which can function as either agonists (mimetics) or as antagonists. Variants can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation or truncation. An agonist can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein. An antagonist of a protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein by, for example, competitively binding to a downstream or upstream member of a cellular signaling cascade which includes the protein of interest. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant of limited function. Treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein can have fewer side effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Variants of a protein of the invention which function as either agonists (mimetics) or as antagonists can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g, truncation mutants, of the protein of the invention for agonist or antagonist activity. In one embodiment, a variegated library of variants is generated by combinatorial mutagenesis at the nucleic acid level and is encoded by a variegated gene library. A variegated library of variants can be produced by, for example, enzymatically ligating a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides into gene sequences such that a degenerate set of potential protein sequences is expressible as individual polypeptides, or alternatively, as a set of larger fusion proteins (e.g., for phage display). There are a variety of methods which can be used to produce libraries of potential variants of the polypeptides of the invention from a degenerate oligonucleotide sequence. Methods for synthesizing degenerate oligonucleotides are known in the art (see, e.g., Narang, 1983<highlight><italic>, Tetrahedron </italic></highlight>39:3; Itakura et al, 1984<highlight><italic>, Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>53:323; Itakura et al, 1984<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>198:1056; Ike et al., 1983 <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acid Res. </italic></highlight>11:477). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In addition, libraries of fragments of the coding sequence of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be used to generate a variegated population of polypeptides for screening and subsequent selection of variants. For example, a library of coding sequence fragments can be generated by treating a double stranded PCR fragment of the coding sequence of interest with a nuclease under conditions wherein nicking occurs only about once per molecule, denaturing the double stranded DNA, renaturing the DNA to form double stranded DNA which can include sense/antisense pairs from different nicked products, removing single stranded portions from reformed duplexes by treatment with S1 nuclease, and ligating the resulting fragment library into an expression vector. By this method, an expression library can be derived which encodes amino terminal and internal fragments of various sizes of the protein of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Several techniques are known in the art for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property. The most widely used techniques, which are amenable to high through-put analysis, for screening large gene libraries typically include cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify variants of a protein of the invention (Arkin and Yourvan, 1992<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al, 1993<highlight><italic>, Protein Engineering </italic></highlight>6(3):327-331). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> An isolated polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention, or a fragment thereof, can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. The full-length polypeptide or protein can be used or, alternatively, the invention provides antigenic peptide fragments for use as immunogens. The antigenic peptide of a protein of the invention comprises at least 8 (preferably 10, 15, 20, or 30 or more) amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of one of the polypeptides of the invention, and encompasses an epitope of the protein such that an antibody raised against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with a marker gene of the invention to which the protein corresponds. Preferred epitopes encompassed by the antigenic peptide are regions that are located on the surface of the protein, e.g., hydrophilic regions. Hydrophobicity sequence analysis, hydrophilicity sequence analysis, or similar analyses can be used to identify hydrophilic regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> An immunogen typically is used to prepare antibodies by immunizing a suitable (i.e. immunocompetent) subject such as a rabbit, goat, mouse, or other mammal or vertebrate. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, recombinantly-expressed or chemically-synthesized polypeptide. The preparation can further include an adjuvant, such as Freund&apos;s complete or incomplete adjuvant, or a similar immunostimulatory agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to antibodies directed against a polypeptide of the invention. The terms &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; and &ldquo;antibody substance&rdquo; as used interchangeably herein refer to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site which specifically binds an antigen, such as a polypeptide of the invention, e.g., an epitope of a polypeptide of the invention. A molecule which specifically binds to a given polypeptide of the invention is a molecule which binds the polypeptide, but does not substantially bind other molecules in a sample, e.g., a biological sample, which naturally contains the polypeptide. Examples of immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules include F(ab) and F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody with an enzyme such as pepsin. The invention provides polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The term &ldquo;monoclonal antibody&rdquo; or &ldquo;monoclonal antibody composition&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one species of an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared as described above by immunizing a suitable subject with a polypeptide of the invention as an immunogen. Preferred polyclonal antibody compositions are ones that have been selected for antibodies directed against a polypeptide or polypeptides of the invention. Particularly preferred polyclonal antibody preparations are ones that contain only antibodies directed against a polypeptide or polypeptides of the invention. Particularly preferred immunogen compositions are those that contain no other human proteins such as, for example, immunogen compositions made using a non-human host cell for recombinant expression of a polypeptide of the invention. In such a manner, the only human epitope or epitopes recognized by the resulting antibody compositions raised against this immunogen will be present as part of a polypeptide or polypeptides of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The antibody titer in the immunized subject can be monitored over time by standard techniques, such as with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized polypeptide. If desired, the antibody molecules can be harvested or isolated from the subject (e.g., from the blood or serum of the subject) and further purified by well-known techniques, such as protein A chromatography to obtain the IgG fraction. Alternatively, antibodies specific for a protein or polypeptide of the invention can be selected or (e.g., partially purified) or purified by. e.g., affinity chromatography. For example, a recombinantly expressed and purified (or partially purified) protein of the invention is produced as described herein, and covalently or non-covalently coupled to a solid support such as, for example, a chromatography column. The column can then be used to affinity purify antibodies specific for the proteins of the invention from a sample containing antibodies directed against a large number of different epitopes, thereby generating a substantially purified antibody composition, i.e., one that is substantially free of contaminating antibodies. By a substantially purified antibody composition is meant, in this context, that the antibody sample contains at most only 30% (by dry weight) of contaminating antibodies directed against epitopes other than those of the desired protein or polypeptide of the invention, and preferably at most 20%, yet more preferably at most 10%, and most preferably at most 5% (by dry weight) of the sample is contaminating antibodies. A purified antibody composition means that at least 99% of the antibodies in the composition are directed against the desired protein or polypeptide of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> At an appropriate time after immunization, e.g., when the specific antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>256:495-497, the human B cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor et al, 1983<highlight><italic>, Immunol. Today </italic></highlight>4:72), the EBV-hybridoma technique (see Cole et al, pp. 77-96 In <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy</italic></highlight>, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985) or trioma techniques. The technology for producing hybridomas is well known (see generally Current Protocols in <highlight><italic>Immunology</italic></highlight>, Coligan et al. ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994). Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind the polypeptide of interest, e.g., using a standard ELISA assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody directed against a polypeptide of the invention can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with the polypeptide of interest. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia <highlight><italic>Recombinant Phage Antibody System</italic></highlight>, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene <highlight><italic>SurfZAP Phage Display Kit</italic></highlight>, Catalog No. 240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; PCT Publication No. WO 92/18619; PCT Publication No. WO 91/17271; PCT Publication No. WO 92/20791; PCT Publication No. WO 92/15679; PCT Publication No. WO 93/01288; PCT Publication No. WO 92/01047; PCT Publication No. WO 92/09690; PCT Publication No. WO 90/02809; Fuchs et al (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>9:1370-1372; Hay et al.

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are within the scope of the invention. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a munne mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarily determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in PCT Publication No. WO 87/02671; European Patent Application 184,187; European Patent Application 171,496; European Patent Application 173,494; PCT Publication No. WO 86/01533; U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Antibodies of the invention may be used as therapeutic agents in treating cancers. In a preferred embodiment, completely human antibodies of the invention are used for therapeutic treatment of human cancer patients, particularly those having an ovarian cancer. Such antibodies can be produced, for example, using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995) <highlight><italic>Int. Rev. Immunol </italic></highlight>13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,126; U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,016; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,806. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.), can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as &ldquo;guided selection.&rdquo; In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a murine antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al, 1994<highlight><italic>, Bio/technology </italic></highlight>12:899-903). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> An antibody directed against a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention (e.g., a monoclonal antibody) can be used to isolate the polypeptide by standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Moreover, such an antibody can be used to detect the marker gene (e.g., in a cellular lysate or cell supernatant) in order to evaluate the level and pattern of expression of the marker gene. The antibodies can also be used diagnostically to monitor protein levels in tissues or body fluids (e.g. in an ovary-associated body fluid) as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to, for example, determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, &bgr;-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Further, an antibody (or fragment thereof) can be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, .alpha.-interferon, .beta.-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (&ldquo;IL-1&rdquo;), interleukin-2 (&ldquo;IL-2&rdquo;), interleukin-6 (&ldquo;IL-6&rdquo;), granulocyte macrophase colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;GM-CSF&rdquo;), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;G-CSF&rdquo;), or other growth factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., &ldquo;Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy&rdquo;, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., &ldquo;Antibodies For Drug Delivery&rdquo;, in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, &ldquo;Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review&rdquo;, in Monoclonal Antibodies &apos;84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al. (eds.), pp. 475-506 (1985); &ldquo;Analysis, Results, And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy&rdquo;, in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy, Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp. 303-16 (Academic Press 1985), and Thorpe et al., &ldquo;The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of Antibody-Toxin Conjugates&rdquo;, Immunol. Rev., 62:119-58 (1982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides substantially purified antibodies or fragments thereof, and non-human antibodies or fragments thereof, which antibodies or fragments specifically bind to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of the present invention, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA of the present invention, a fragment of at least 15 amino acid residues of an amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of the present invention (wherein the percent identity is determined using the ALIGN program of the GCG software package with a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4) and an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule which hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule consisting of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, or a complement thereof, under conditions of hybridization of 6&times; SSC at 45&deg; C. and washing in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C. In various embodiments, the substantially purified antibodies of the invention, or fragments thereof, can be human, non-human, chimeric and/or humanized antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides non-human antibodies or fragments thereof, which antibodies or fragments specifically bind to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: the amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA of the present invention, a fragment of at least 15 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of the present invention (wherein the percent identity is determined using the ALIGN program of the GCG software package with a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4) and an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule which hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule consisting of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, or a complement thereof, under conditions of hybridization of 6&times; SSC at 45&deg; C. and washing in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C. Such non-human antibodies can be goat, mouse, sheep, horse, chicken, rabbit, or rat antibodies. Alternatively, the non-human antibodies of the invention can be chimeric and/or humanized antibodies. In addition, the non-human antibodies of the invention can be polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect, the invention provides monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof, which antibodies or fragments specifically bind to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of the present invention, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA of the present invention, a fragment of at least 15 amino acid residues of an amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to an amino acid sequence of the present invention (wherein the percent identity is determined using the ALIGN program of the GCG software package with a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4) and an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule which hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule consisting of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, or a complement thereof, under conditions of hybridization of 6&times; SSC at 45&deg; C. and washing in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C. The monoclonal antibodies can be human, humanized, chimeric and/or non-human antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The substantially purified antibodies or fragments thereof may specifically bind to a signal peptide, a secreted sequence, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane or a cytoplasmic domain or cytoplasmic membrane of a polypeptide of the invention. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the substantially purified antibodies or fragments thereof, the non-human antibodies or fragments thereof, and/or the monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof, of the invention specifically bind to a secreted sequence or an extracellular domain of the amino acid sequences of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Any of the antibodies of the invention can be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or to a detectable substance. Non-limiting examples of detectable substances that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention are an enzyme, a prosthetic group, a fluorescent material, a luminescent material, a bioluminescent material, and a radioactive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a kit containing an antibody of the invention conjugated to a detectable substance, and instructions for use. Still another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains an antibody of the invention, a therapeutic moiety, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Still another aspect of the invention is a method of making an antibody that specifically recognizes a polypeptide of the present invention, the method comprising immunizing a mammal with a polypeptide. The polypeptide used as an immungen comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, a fragment of at least 15 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of the present invention, an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of the present invention (wherein the percent identity is determined using the ALIGN program of the GCG software package with a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4) and an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule which hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule consisting of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, or a complement thereof, under conditions of hybridization of 6&times; SSC at 45&deg; C. and washing in 0.2&times; SSC, 0. 1% SDS at 65&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> After immunization, a sample is collected from the mammal that contains an antibody that specifically recognizes the polypeptide. Preferably, the polypeptide is recombinantly produced using a non-human host cell. Optionally, the antibodies can be further purified from the sample using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. The method can further comprise producing a monoclonal antibody-producing cell from the cells of the mammal. Optionally, antibodies are collected from the antibody-producing cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> III. Recombinant Expression Vectors and Host Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention pertains to vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention (or a portion of such a polypeptide). As used herein, the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a &ldquo;plasmid&rdquo;, which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors, namely expression vectors, are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operably linked. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids (vectors). However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. This means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). The term &ldquo;regulatory sequence&rdquo; is intended to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Goeddel, <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology: Gene Expression Technology </italic></highlight>vol. 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1991). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those which direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g, tissue-specific regulatory sequences). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention in prokaryotic (e.g., <highlight><italic>E coli</italic></highlight>) or eukaryotic cells (e.g., insect cells &lcub;using baculovirus expression vectors&rcub;, yeast cells or mammalian cells). Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, supra. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith and Johnson, 1988<highlight><italic>, Gene </italic></highlight>67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>expression vectors include pTrc (Amann et al., 1988<highlight><italic>, Gene </italic></highlight>69:301-315) and pET 11d (Studier et al, p. 60-89, In <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>vol. 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1991). Target gene expression from the pTrc vector relies on host RNA polymerase transcription from a hybrid trp-lac fusion promoter. Target gene expression from the pET 11d vector relies on transcription from a T7 gn10-lac fusion promoter mediated by a co-expressed viral RNA polymerase (T7 gn1). This viral polymerase is supplied by host strains BL21(DE3) or HMS174(DE3) from a resident prophage harboring a T7 gn1 gene under the transcriptional control of the lacUV 5 promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> One strategy to maximize recombinant protein expression in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is to express the protein in a host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, p. 119-128, In <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>vol. 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1990. Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(Wada et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the expression vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast <highlight><italic>S. cerevislae </italic></highlight>include pYepSec1 (Baldari et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6:229-234), pMFa (Kujan and Herskowitz, 1982<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>30:933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, Gene </italic></highlight>54:113-123), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and pPicZ (Invitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the expression vector is a baculovirus expression vector. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., Sf 9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith et al., 1983<highlight><italic>, Mol. Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>3:2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers, 1989<highlight><italic>, Virology </italic></highlight>170:31-39). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a nucleic acid of the invention is expressed in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, 1987<highlight><italic>, Nature </italic></highlight>329:840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6:187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector&apos;s control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook et al, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al, 1987<highlight><italic>, Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton, 1988<highlight><italic>, Adv. Immunol. </italic></highlight>43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore, 1989<highlight><italic>, EMBO J. </italic></highlight>8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al., 1983<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore, 1983<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle, 1989<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al, 1985<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss, 1990<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>249:374-379) and the &agr;-fetoprotein promoter (Camper and Tilghman, 1989<highlight><italic>, Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>3:537-546). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA molecule of the invention cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation. That is, the DNA molecule is operably linked to a regulatory sequence in a manner which allows for expression (by transcription of the DNA molecule) of an RNA molecule which is antisense to the mRNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention. Regulatory sequences operably linked to a nucleic acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the continuous expression of the antisense RNA molecule in a variety of cell types, for instance viral promoters and/or enhancers, or regulatory sequences can be chosen which direct constitutive, tissue-specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA. The antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid, or attenuated virus in which antisense nucleic acids are produced under the control of a high efficiency regulatory region, the activity of which can be determined by the cell type into which the vector is introduced. For a discussion of the regulation of gene expression using antisense genes see Weintraub et al, 1986<highlight><italic>, Trends in Genetics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1(1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention pertains to host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. The terms &ldquo;host cell&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant host cell&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein. It is understood that such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> A host cell can be any prokaryotic (e.g., <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>) or eukaryotic cell (eg., insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfection&rdquo; are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can be found in Sambrook, et al (supra), and other laboratory manuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker gene (e.g., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable marker genes include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> A host cell of the invention, such as a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell in culture, can be used to produce a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention using the host cells of the invention. In one embodiment, the method comprises culturing the host cell of invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a polypeptide of the invention has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that the marker gene is produced. In another embodiment, the method further comprises isolating the marker gene polypeptide from the medium or the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The host cells of the invention can also be used to produce nonhuman transgenic animals. For example, in one embodiment, a host cell of the invention is a fertilized oocyte or an embryonic stem cell into which a sequences encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention have been introduced. Such host cells can then be used to create non-human transgenic animals in which exogenous sequences encoding a marker gene protein of the invention have been introduced into their genome or homologous recombinant animals in which endogenous gene(s) encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention sequences have been altered. Such animals are useful for studying the function and/or activity of the polypeptide corresponding to the marker gene and for identifying and/or evaluating modulators of polypeptide activity. As used herein, a &ldquo;transgenic animal&rdquo; is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a rodent such as a rat or mouse, in which one or more of the cells of the animal includes a transgene. Other examples of transgenic animals include non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cows, goats, chickens, amphibians, etc. A transgene is exogenous DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops and which remains in the genome of the mature animal, thereby directing the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic animal. As used herein, an &ldquo;homologous recombinant animal&rdquo; is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a mouse, in which an endogenous gene has been altered by homologous recombination between the endogenous gene and an exogenous DNA molecule introduced into a cell of the animal, e.g., an embryonic cell of the animal, prior to development of the animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> A transgenic animal of the invention can be created by introducing a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention into the male pronuclei of a fertilized oocyte, e.g., by microinjection, retroviral infection, and allowing the oocyte to develop in a pseudopregnant female foster animal. Intronic sequences and polyadenylation signals can also be included in the transgene to increase the efficiency of expression of the transgene. A tissue-specific regulatory sequence(s) can be operably linked to the transgene to direct expression of the polypeptide of the invention to particular cells. Methods for generating transgenic animals via embryo manipulation and microinjection, particularly animals such as mice, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866 and 4,870,009, U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 and in Hogan, <highlight><italic>Manipulating the Mouse Embryo</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1986. Similar methods are used for production of other transgenic animals. A trarisgenic founder animal can be identified based upon the presence of the transgene in its genome and/or expression of mRNA encoding the transgene in tissues or cells of the animals. A transgenic founder animal can then be used to breed additional animals carrying the transgene. Moreover, transgenic animals carrying the transgene can further be bred to other transgenic animals carrying other transgenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> To create an homologous recombinant animal, a vector is prepared which contains at least a portion of a gene encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention into which a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced to thereby alter, e.g., functionally disrupt, the gene. In a preferred embodiment, the vector is designed such that, upon homologous recombination, the endogenous gene is functionally disrupted (i.e., no longer encodes a functional protein; also referred to as a &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; vector). Alternatively, the vector can be designed such that, upon homologous recombination, the endogenous gene is mutated or otherwise altered but still encodes functional protein (e.g., the upstream regulatory region can be altered to thereby alter the expression of the endogenous protein). In the homologous recombination vector, the altered portion of the gene is flanked at its 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends by additional nucleic acid of the gene to allow for homologous recombination to occur between the exogenous gene carried by the vector and an endogenous gene in an embryonic stem cell. The additional flanking nucleic acid sequences are of sufficient length for successful homologous recombination with the endogenous gene. Typically, several kilobases of flanking DNA (both at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends) are included in the vector (see, e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, 1987<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>51:503 for a description of homologous recombination vectors). The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced gene has homologously recombined with the endogenous gene are selected (see, ag., Li et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>69:915). The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse) to form aggregation chimeras (see, e.g., Bradley, <highlight><italic>Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach</italic></highlight>, Robertson, Ed., IRL, Oxford, 1987, pp. 113-152). A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA by germline transmission of the transgene. Methods for constructing homologous recombination vectors and homologous recombinant animals are described further in Bradley (1991) <highlight><italic>Current Opinion in Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>2:823-829 and in PCT Publication NOS. WO 90/11354, WO 91/01140, WO 92/0968, and WO 93/04169. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, transgenic non-human animals can be produced which contain selected systems which allow for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage P1. For a description of the cre/loxP recombinase system, see, e.g., Lakso et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>89:6232-6236. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>(O&apos;Gorman et al., 1991<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>251:1351-1355). If acre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be provided through the construction of &ldquo;double&rdquo; transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Clones of the non-human transgenic animals described herein can also be produced according to the methods described in Wilmut et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>385:810-813 and PCT Publication NOS. WO 97/07668 and WO 97/07669. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> IV. Pharmaceutical Compositions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, and antibodies (also referred to herein as &ldquo;active compounds&rdquo;) corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise the nucleic acid molecule, protein, or antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language &ldquo;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&rdquo; is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The invention includes methods for preparing pharmaceutical compositions for modulating the expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Such methods comprise formulating a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with an agent which modulates expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. Such compositions can further include additional active agents. Thus, the invention further includes methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition by formulating a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with an agent which modulates expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention and one or more additional active compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides methods (also referred to herein as &ldquo;screening assays&rdquo;) for identifying modulators, i e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small molecules or other drugs) which (a) bind to the marker gene, or (b) have a modulatory (e.g., stimulatory or inhibitory) effect on the activity of the marker gene or, more specifically, (c) have a modulatory effect on the interactions of the marker gene with one or more of its natural substrates (e.g., peptide, protein, hormone, co-factor, or nucleic acid), or (d) have a modulatory effect on the expression of the marker gene. Such assays typically comprise a reaction between the marker gene and one or more assay components. The other components may be either the test compound itself, or a combination of test compound and a natural binding partner of the marker gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> The test compounds of the present invention may be obtained from any available source, including systematic libraries of natural and/or synthetic compounds. Test compounds may also be obtained by any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; peptoid libraries (libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides, but with a novel, non-peptide backbone which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but which nevertheless remain bioactive; see, e.g., Zuckermann et al, 1994<highlight><italic>, J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>37:2678-85); spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the &lsquo;one-bead one-compound&rsquo; library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library and peptoid library approaches are limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, 1997<highlight><italic>, Anticancer Drug Des. </italic></highlight>12:145). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt et al (1993) <highlight><italic>Proc.

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which are substrates of a marker gene or biologically active portion thereof. In another embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which bind to a marker gene or biologically active portion thereof. Determining the ability of the test compound to directly bind to a marker gene can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the compound to the marker gene can be determined by detecting the labeled marker gene compound in a complex. For example, compounds (e.g., marker gene substrates) can be labeled with <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C, or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, assay components can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which modulate the activity of a marker gene or a biologically active portion thereof. In all likelihood, the marker gene can, in vivo, interact with one or more molecules, such as but not limited to, peptides, proteins, hormones, cofactors and nucleic acids. For the purposes of this discussion, such cellular and extracellular molecules are referred to herein as &ldquo;binding partners&rdquo; or marker gene &ldquo;substrate&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> One necessary embodiment of the invention in order to facilitate such screening is the use of the marker gene to identify its natural in vivo binding partners. There are many ways to accomplish this which are known to one skilled in the art. One example is the use of the marker gene protein as &ldquo;bait protein&rdquo; in a two-hybrid assay or three-hybrid assay (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,317; Zervos et al, 1993<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>72:223-232; Madura et al, 1993<highlight><italic>, J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>268:12046-12054; Bartel et al ,1993<highlight><italic>, Biotechniques </italic></highlight>14:920-924; Iwabuchi et al, 1993 <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>8:1693-1696; Brent WO94/10300) in order to identify other proteins which bind to or interact with the marker gene (binding partners) and, therefore, are possibly involved in the natural function of the marker gene. Such marker gene binding partners are also likely to be involved in the propagation of signals by the marker gene or downstream elements of a marker gene-mediated signaling pathway. Alternatively, such marker gene binding partners may also be found to be inhibitors of the marker gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The two-hybrid system is based on the modular nature of most transcription factors, which consist of separable DNA-binding and activation domains. Briefly, the assay utilizes two different DNA constructs. In one construct, the gene that encodes a marker gene protein fused to a gene encoding the DNA binding domain of a known transcription factor (e.g., GAL-4). In the other construct, a DNA sequence, from a library of DNA sequences, that encodes an unidentified protein (&ldquo;prey&rdquo; or &ldquo;sample&rdquo;) is fused to a gene that codes for the activation domain of the known transcription factor. If the &ldquo;bait&rdquo; and the &ldquo;prey&rdquo; proteins are able to interact, in vivo, forming a marker gene-dependent complex, the DNA-binding and activation domains of the transcription factor are brought into close proximity. This proximity allows transcription of a reporter gene (e.g., LacZ) which is operably linked to a transcriptional regulatory site responsive to the transcription factor. Expression of the reporter gene can be readily detected and cell colonies containing the functional transcription factor can be isolated and used to obtain the cloned gene which encodes the protein which interacts with the marker gene protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, assays may be devised through the use of the invention for the purpose of identifying compounds which modulate (e.g., affect either positively or negatively) interactions between a marker gene and its substrates and/or binding partners. Such compounds can include, but are not limited to, molecules such as antibodies, peptides, hormones, oligonucleotides, nucleic acids, and analogs thereof. Such compounds may also be obtained from any available source, including systematic libraries of natural and/or synthetic compounds. The preferred assay components for use in this embodiment is an ovarian cancer marker gene identified herein, the known binding partner and/or substrate of same, and the test compound. Test compounds can be supplied from any source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The basic principle of the assay systems used to identify compounds that interfere with the interaction between the marker gene and its binding partner involves preparing a reaction mixture containing the marker gene and its binding partner under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two products to interact and bind, thus forming a complex. In order to test an agent for inhibitory activity, the reaction mixture is prepared in the presence and absence of the test compound. The test compound can be initially included in the reaction mixture, or can be added at a time subsequent to the addition of the marker gene and its binding partner. Control reaction mixtures are incubated without the test compound or with a placebo. The formation of any complexes between the marker gene and its binding partner is then detected. The formation of a complex in the control reaction, but less or no such formation in the reaction mixture containing the test compound, indicates that the compound interferes with the interaction of the marker gene and its binding partner. Conversely, the formation of more complex in the presence of compound than in the control reaction indicates that the compound may enhance interaction of the marker gene and its binding partner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The assay for compounds that interfere with the interaction of the marker gene with its binding partner may be conducted in a heterogeneous or homogeneous format. Heterogeneous assays involve anchoring either the marker gene or its binding partner onto a solid phase and detecting complexes anchored to the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In homogeneous assays, the entire reaction is carried out in a liquid phase. In either approach, the order of addition of reactants can be varied to obtain different information about the compounds being tested. For example, test compounds that interfere with the interaction between the marker genes and the binding partners (e.g., by competition) can be identified by conducting the reaction in the presence of the test substance, i.e., by adding the test substance to the reaction mixture prior to or simultaneously with the marker gene and its interactive binding partner. Alternatively, test compounds that disrupt preformed complexes, e.g., compounds with higher binding constants that displace one of the components from the complex, can be tested by adding the test compound to the reaction mixture after complexes have been formed. The various formats are briefly described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> In a heterogeneous assay system, either the marker gene or its binding partner is anchored onto a solid surface or matrix, while the other corresponding non-anchored component may be labeled, either directly or indirectly. In practice, microtitre plates are often utilized for this approach. The anchored species can be immobilized by a number of methods, either non-covalent or covalent, that are typically well known to one who practices the art. Non-covalent attachment can often be accomplished simply by coating the solid surface with a solution of the marker gene or its binding partner and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody specific for the assay component to be anchored can be used for this purpose. Such surfaces can often be prepared in advance and stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In related embodiments, a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows one or both of the assay components to be anchored to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S-transferase/marker gene fusion proteins or glutathione-S-transferase/binding partner can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtiter plates, which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non-adsorbed marker gene or its binding partner, and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g., physiological conditions). Following incubation, the beads or microtiter plate wells are washed to remove any unbound assay components, the immobilized complex assessed either directly or indirectly, for example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix, and the level of marker gene binding or activity determined using standard techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Other techniques for immobilizing proteins on matrices can also be used in the screening assays of the invention. For example, either a marker gene or a marker gene binding partner can be immobilized utilizing conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated marker gene protein or target molecules can be prepared from biotin-NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). In certain embodiments, the protein-immobilized surfaces can be prepared in advance and stored. In order to conduct the assay, the corresponding partner of the immobilized assay component is exposed to the coated surface with or without the test compound. After the reaction is complete, unreacted assay components are removed (e.g., by washing) and any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the non-immobilized component is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Where the non-immobilized component is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the initially non-immobilized species (the antibody, in turn, can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with, e.g., a labeled anti-Ig antibody). Depending upon the order of addition of reaction components, test compounds which modulate (inhibit or enhance) complex formation or which disrupt preformed complexes can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, a homogeneous assay may be used. This is typically a reaction, analogous to those mentioned above, which is conducted in a liquid phase in the presence or absence of the test compound. The formed complexes are then separated from unreacted components, and the amount of complex formed is determined. As mentioned for heterogeneous assay systems, the order of addition of reactants to the liquid phase can yield information about which test compounds modulate (inhibit or enhance) complex formation and which disrupt preformed complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In such a homogeneous assay, the reaction products may be separated from unreacted assay components by any of a number of standard techniques, including but not limited to: differential centrifugation, chromatography, electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. In differential centrifugation, complexes of molecules may be separated from uncomplexed molecules through a series of centrifugal steps, due to the different sedimentation equilibria of complexes based on their different sizes and densities (see, for example, Rivas, G., and Minton, A. P., <highlight><italic>Trends Biochem Sci </italic></highlight>1993 August;18(8):284-7). Standard chromatographic techniques may also be utilized to separate complexed molecules from uncomplexed ones. For example, gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on size, and through the utilization of an appropriate gel filtration resin in a column format, for example, the relatively larger complex may be separated from the relatively smaller uncomplexed components. Similarly, the relatively different charge properties of the complex as compared to the uncomplexed molecules may be exploited to differentially separate the complex from the remaining individual reactants, for example through the use of ion-exchange chromatography resins. Such resins and chromatographic techniques are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Heegaard, 1998<highlight><italic>, J. Mol. Recognit </italic></highlight>11:141-148; Hage and Tweed, 1997<highlight><italic>, J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl., </italic></highlight>699:499-525). Gel electrophoresis may also be employed to separate complexed molecules from unbound species (see, e.g., Ausubel et al (eds.), In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1999). In this technique, protein or nucleic acid complexes are separated based on size or charge, for example. In order to maintain the binding interaction during the electrophoretic process, nondenaturing gels in the absence of reducing agent are typically preferred, but conditions appropriate to the particular interactants will be well known to one skilled in the art. Immunoprecipitation is another common technique utilized for the isolation of a protein-protein complex from solution (see, e.g., Ausubel et al (eds.), In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1999). In this technique, all proteins binding to an antibody specific to one of the binding molecules are precipitated from solution by conjugating the antibody to a polymer bead that may be readily collected by centrifugation. The bound assay components are released from the beads (through a specific proteolysis event or other technique well known in the art which will not disturb the protein-protein interaction in the complex), and a second immunoprecipitation step is performed, this time utilizing antibodies specific for the correspondingly different interacting assay component. In this manner, only formed complexes should remain attached to the beads. Variations in complex formation in both the presence and the absence of a test compound can be compared, thus offering information about the ability of the compound to modulate interactions between the marker gene and its binding partner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the present invention are methods for direct detection of interactions between the marker gene and its natural binding partner and/or a test compound in a homogeneous or heterogeneous assay system without further sample manipulation. For example, the technique of fluorescence energy transfer may be utilized (see, e.g., Lakowicz et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). Generally, this technique involves the addition of a fluorophore label on a first &lsquo;donor&rsquo; molecule (e.g., marker gene or test compound) such that its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second, &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule (e.g., marker gene or test compound), which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately, the &lsquo;donor&rsquo; protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light, such that the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label may be differentiated from that of the &lsquo;donor&rsquo;. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, spatial relationships between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter). A test substance which either enhances or hinders participation of one of the species in the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal variant to that of background. In this way, test substances that modulate interactions between a marker gene and its binding partner can be identified in controlled assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, modulators of marker gene expression are identified in a method wherein a cell is contacted with a candidate compound and the expression of mRNA or protein, corresponding to a marker gene in the cell, is determined. The level of expression of mRNA or protein in the presence of the candidate compound is compared to the level of expression of mRNA or protein in the absence of the candidate compound. The candidate compound can then be identified as a modulator of marker gene expression based on this comparison. For example, when expression of marker gene mRNA or protein is greater (statistically significantly greater) in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as a stimulator of marker gene mRNA or protein expression. Conversely, when expression of marker gene mRNA or protein is less (statistically significantly less) in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as an inhibitor of marker gene mRNA or protein expression. The level of marker gene mRNA or protein expression in the cells can be determined by methods described herein for detecting marker gene mRNA or protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention pertains to a combination of two or more of the assays described herein. For example, a modulating agent can be identified using a cell-based or a cell free assay, and the ability of the agent to modulate the activity of a marker gene protein can be further confirmed in vivo, e.g., in a whole animal model for cellular transformation and/or tumorigenesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> This invention further pertains to novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an agent identified as described herein in an appropriate animal model. For example, an agent identified as described herein (e.g., an marker gene modulating agent, an antisense marker gene nucleic acid molecule, an marker gene-specific antibody, or an marker gene-binding partner) can be used in an animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such an agent. Alternatively, an agent identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the mechanism of action of such an agent. Furthermore, this invention pertains to uses of novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays for treatments as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> It is understood that appropriate doses of small molecule agents and protein or polypeptide agents depends upon a number of factors within the knowledge of the ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or researcher. The dose(s) of these agents will vary, for example, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject or sample being treated, further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered, if applicable, and the effect which the practitioner desires the agent to have upon the nucleic acid or polypeptide of the invention. Exemplary doses of a small molecule include milligram or microgram amounts per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g. about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram). Exemplary doses of a protein or polypeptide include gram, milligram or microgram amounts per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g. about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 5 grams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 milligram per kilogram to about 50 milligrams per kilogram). It is furthermore understood that appropriate doses of one of these agents depend upon the potency of the agent with respect to the expression or activity to be modulated. Such appropriate doses can be determined using the assays described herein. When one or more of these agents is to be administered to an animal (e.g. a human) in order to modulate expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid of the invention, a physician, veterinarian, or researcher can, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. In addition, it is understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradernal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL (BASF; Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a polypeptide or antibody) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium, and then incorporating the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes having monoclonal antibodies incorporated therein or thereon) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> For antibodies, the preferred dosage is 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight (generally 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). If the antibody is to act in the brain, a dosage of 50 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg is usually appropriate. Generally, partially human antibodies and fully human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than other antibodies. Accordingly, lower dosages and less frequent administration is often possible. Modifications such as lipidation can be used to stabilize antibodies and to enhance uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the ovarian epithelium). A method for lipidation of antibodies is described by Cruikshank et al (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology </italic></highlight>14:193. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules corresponding to a marker gene of the invention can be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470), or by stereotactic injection (see, e.g., Chen et al., 1994<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g. retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> V. Predictive Medicine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, pharmacogenomics, and monitoring clinical trails are used for prognostic (predictive) purposes to thereby treat an individual prophylactically. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to diagnostic assays for determining the level of expression of polypeptides or nucleic acids corresponding to one or more marker genes of the invention, in order to determine whether an individual is at risk of developing ovarian cancer. Such assays can be used for prognostic or predictive purposes to thereby prophylactically treat an individual prior to the onset of the cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drugs or other compounds administered either to inhibit ovarian cancer or to treat or prevent any other disorder &lcub;i.e. in order to understand any ovarian carcinogenic effects that such treatment may have&rcub;) on the expression or activity of a marker gene of the invention in clinical trials. These and other agents are described in further detail in the following sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> A. Diagnostic Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> An exemplary method for detecting the presence or absence of a polypeptide or nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention in a biological sample involves obtaining a biological sample (e.g. an ovary-associated body fluid) from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting the polypeptide or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA, genomic DNA, or cDNA). The detection methods of the invention can thus be used to detect mRNA, protein, cDNA, or genomic DNA, for example, in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro techniques for detection of mRNA include Northeni hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. Furthermore, in vivo techniques for detection of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against the polypeptide. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker gene whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> A general principle of such diagnostic and prognostic assays involves preparing a sample or reaction mixture that may contain a marker gene, and a probe, under appropriate conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the marker gene and probe to interact and bind, thus forming a complex that can be removed and/or detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> For example, one method to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring the marker gene or probe onto a solid phase support, also referred to as a substrate, and detecting target marker gene/probe complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method, a sample from a subject, which is to be assayed for presence and/or concentration of marker gene, can be anchored onto a carrier or solid phase support. In another embodiment, the reverse situation is possible, in which the probe can be anchored to a solid phase and a sample from a subject can be allowed to react as an unanchored component of the assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> There are many established methods for anchoring assay components to a solid phase. These include, without limitation, marker gene or probe molecules which are immobilized through conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Such biotinylated assay components can be prepared from biotin-NHS(N-hydroxy-succmimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). In certain embodiments, the surfaces with immobilized assay components can be prepared in advance and stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Other suitable carriers or solid phase supports for such assays include any material capable of binding the class of molecule to which the marker gene or probe belongs. Well-known supports or carriers include, but are not limited to, glass, polystyrene, nylon, polypropylene, nylon, polyethylene, dextran, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In order to conduct assays with the above mentioned approaches, the non-immobilized component is added to the solid phase upon which the second component is anchored. After the reaction is complete, uncomplexed components may be removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized upon the solid phase. The detection of marker gene/probe complexes anchored to the solid phase can be accomplished in a number of methods outlined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the probe, when it is the unanchored assay component, can be labeled for the purpose of detection and readout of the assay, either directly or indirectly, with detectable labels discussed herein and which are well-known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to directly detect marker gene/probe complex formation without further manipulation or labeling of either component (marker gene or probe), for example by utilizing the technique of fluorescence energy transfer (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first, &lsquo;donor&rsquo; molecule is selected such that, upon excitation with incident light of appropriate wavelength, its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule, which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately, the &lsquo;donor&rsquo; protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light, such that the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label may be differentiated from that of the &lsquo;donor&rsquo;. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, spatial relationships between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e g, using a fluorimeter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, determination of the ability of a probe to recognize a marker gene can be accomplished without labeling either assay component (probe or marker gene) by utilizing a technology such as real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) (see, eg, Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C., 1991<highlight><italic>, Anal Chem. </italic></highlight>63:2338-2345 and Szabo et al, 1995<highlight><italic>, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. </italic></highlight>5:699-705). As used herein, &ldquo;BIA&rdquo; or &ldquo;surface plasmon resonance&rdquo; is a technology for studying biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BIAcore). Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)), resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in another embodiment, analogous diagnostic and prognostic assays can be conducted with marker gene and probe as solutes in a liquid phase. In such an assay, the complexed marker gene and probe are separated from uncomplexed components by any of a number of standard techniques, including but not limited to: differential centrifigation, chromatography, electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. In differential centrifugation, marker gene/probe complexes may be separated from uncomplexed assay components through a series of centrifugal steps, due to the different sedimentation equilibria of complexes based on their different sizes and densities (see, for example, Rivas, G., and Minton, A. P., 1993<highlight><italic>, Trends Biochem Sci </italic></highlight>18(8):284-7). Standard chromatographic techniques may also be utilized to separate complexed molecules from uncomplexed ones. For example, gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on size, and through the utilization of an appropriate gel filtration resin in a column format, for example, the relatively larger complex may be separated from the relatively smaller uncomplexed components. Similarly, the relatively different charge properties of the marker gene/probe complex as compared to the uncomplexed components may be exploited to differentiate the complex from uncomplexed components, for example through the utilization of ion-exchange chromatography resins. Such resins and chromatographic techniques are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Heegaard, N. H., 1998<highlight><italic>, J. Mol. Recognit. Winter </italic></highlight>11(1-6): 141-8; Hage, D. S., and Tweed, S. A. <highlight><italic>J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl Oct. </italic></highlight>10, 1997;699(1-2):499-525). Gel electrophoresis may also be employed to separate complexed assay components from unbound components (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, ed., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1987-1999). In this technique, protein or nucleic acid complexes are separated based on size or charge, for example. In order to maintain the binding interaction during the electrophoretic process, non-denaturing gel matrix materials and conditions in the absence of reducing agent are typically preferred. Appropriate conditions to the particular assay and components thereof will be well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment, the level of mRNA corresponding to the marker gene can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats in a biological sample using methods known in the art. The term &ldquo;biological sample&rdquo; is intended to include tissues, cells, biological fluids and isolates thereof, isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA. For in vitro methods, any RNA isolation technique that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the purification of RNA from ovarian cells (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., ed., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1987-1999). Additionally, large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, the single-step RNA isolation process of Chomczynski (1989, U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,155). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One preferred diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length cDNA, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 50, 100, 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to a mRNA or genomic DNA encoding a marker gene of the present invention. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays of the invention are described herein. Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the marker gene in question is being expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> In one format, the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative format, the probe(s) are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe(s), for example, in an Affymetrix gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoded by the marker genes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> An alternative method for determining the level of mRNA corresponding to a marker gene of the present invention in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification, e.g., by rtPCR (the experimental embodiment set forth in Mullis, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany, 1991<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>88:189-193), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al, 1990<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al, 1989<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi et al, 1988<highlight><italic>, Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>6:1197), rolling circle replication (Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. As used herein, amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that can anneal to 5&prime; or 3&prime; regions of a gene (plus and minus strands, respectively, or vice-versa) and contain a short region in between. In general, amplification primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents, such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> For in situ methods, mRNA does not need to be isolated from the ovarian cells prior to detection. In such methods, a cell or tissue sample is prepared/processed using known histological methods. The sample is then immobilized on a support, typically a glass slide, and then contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the marker gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to making determinations based on the absolute expression level of the marker gene, determinations may be based on the normalized expression level of the marker gene. Expression levels are normalized by correcting the absolute expression level of a marker gene by comparing its expression to the expression of a gene that is not a marker gene, e.g., a housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed. Suitable genes for normalization include housekeeping genes such as the actin gene, or epithelial cell-specific genes. This normalization allows the comparison of the expression level in one sample, e.g., a patient sample, to another sample, e g., a non-ovarian cancer sample, or between samples from different sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. To determine a relative expression level of a marker gene, the level of expression of the marker gene is determined for 10 or more samples of normal versus cancer cell isolates, preferably 50 or more samples, prior to the determination of the expression level for the sample in question. The mean expression level of each of the genes assayed in the larger number of samples is determined and this is used as a baseline expression level for the marker gene. The expression level of the marker gene determined for the test sample (absolute level of expression) is then divided by the mean expression value obtained for that marker gene. This provides a relative expression level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the samples used in the baseline determination will be from ovarian cancer or from non-ovarian cancer cells of ovarian tissue. The choice of the cell source is dependent on the use of the relative expression level. Using expression found in normal tissues as a mean expression score aids in validating whether the marker gene assayed is ovarian specific (versus normal cells). In addition, as more data is accumulated, the mean expression value can be revised, providing improved relative expression values based on accumulated data. Expression data from ovarian cells provides a means for grading the severity of the ovarian cancer state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene is detected. A preferred agent for detecting a polypeptide of the invention is an antibody capable of binding to a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention, preferably an antibody with a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal, or more preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab or F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) can be used. The term &ldquo;labeled&rdquo;, with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Proteins from ovarian cells can be isolated using techniques that are well known to those of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed can, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow and Lane, 1988<highlight><italic>, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> A variety of formats can be employed to determine whether a sample contains a protein that binds to a given antibody. Examples of such formats include, but are not limited to, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), Western blot analysis and enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). A skilled artisan can readily adapt known protein/antibody detection methods for use in determining whether ovarian cells express a marker gene of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> In one format, antibodies, or antibody fragments, can be used in methods such as Western blots or immunofluorescence techniques to detect the expressed proteins. In such uses, it is generally preferable to immobilize either the antibody or proteins on a solid support. Suitable solid phase supports or carriers include any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, and will be able to adapt such support for use with the present invention. For example, protein isolated from ovarian cells can be run on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immobilized onto a solid phase support such as nitrocellulose. The support can then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled antibody. The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on the solid support can then be detected by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses kits for detecting the presence of a polypeptide or nucleic acid corresponding to a marker gene of the invention in a biological sample (e.g. an ovary-associated body fluid such as a urine sample). Such kits can be used to determine if a subject is suffering from or is at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. For example, the kit can comprise a labeled compound or agent capable of detecting a polypeptide or an mRNA encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention in a biological sample and means for determining the amount of the polypeptide or mRNA in the sample (e.g., an antibody which binds the polypeptide or an oligonucleotide probe which binds to DNA or mRNA encoding the polypeptide). Kits can also include instructions for interpreting the results obtained using the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> For antibody-based kits. the kit can comprise, for example: (1) a first antibody (e.g., attached to a solid support) which binds to a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention; and, optionally, (2) a second, different antibody which binds to either the polypeptide or the first antibody and is conjugated to a detectable label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> For oligonucleotide-based kits, the kit can comprise, for example: (1) an oligonucleotide, e.g., a detectably labeled oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker gene of the invention or (2) a pair of primers useful for amplifying a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a marker gene of the invention. The kit can also comprise, e.g., a buffering agent, a preservative, or a protein stabilizing agent. The kit can further comprise components necessary for detecting the detectable label (e.g., an enzyme or a substrate). The kit can also contain a control sample or a series of control samples which can be assayed and compared to the test sample. Each component of the kit can be enclosed within an individual container and all of the various containers can be within a single package, along with instructions for interpreting the results of the assays performed using the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> B. Pharmacogenomics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Agents or modulators which have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on expression of a marker gene of the invention can be administered to individuals to treat (prophylactically or therapeutically) ovarian cancer in the patient. In conjunction with such treatment, the pharmacogenomics (i.e., the study of the relationship between an individual&apos;s genotype and that individual&apos;s response to a foreign compound or drug) of the individual may be considered. Differences in metabolism of therapeutics can lead to severe toxicity or therapeutic failure by altering the relation between dose and blood concentration of the pharmacologically active drug. Thus, the pharmacogenomics of the individual permits the selection of effective agents (e.g., drugs) for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments based on a consideration of the individual&apos;s genotype. Such pharmacogenomics can further be used to determine appropriate dosages and therapeutic regimens. Accordingly, the level of expression of a marker gene of the invention in an individual can be determined to thereby select appropriate agent(s) for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of the individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons. See, e.g., Linder (1997) <highlight><italic>Clin. Chem. </italic></highlight>43(2):254-266. In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated. Genetic conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body are referred to as &ldquo;altered drug action.&rdquo; Genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs are referred to as &ldquo;altered drug metabolism&rdquo;. These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur either as rare defects or as polymorphisms. For example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common inherited enzymopathy in which the main clinical complication is hemolysis after ingestion of oxidant drugs (anti-malarials, sulfonamides, analgesics, nitrofurans) and consumption of fava beans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> As an illustrative embodiment, the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes is a major determinant of both the intensity and duration of drug action. The discovery of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT 2) and cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) has provided an explanation as to why some patients do not obtain the expected drug effects or show exaggerated drug response and serious toxicity after taking the standard and safe dose of a drug. These polymorphisms are expressed in two phenotypes in the population, the extensive metabolizer (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM). The prevalence of PM is different among different populations. For example, the gene coding for CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic and several mutations have been identified in PM, which all lead to the absence of functional CYP2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 quite frequently experience exaggerated drug response and side effects when they receive standard doses. If a metabolite is the active therapeutic moiety, a PM will show no therapeutic response, as demonstrated for the analgesic effect of codeine mediated by its CYP2D6-formed metabolite morphine. The other extreme are the so called ultra-rapid metabolizers who do not respond to standard doses. Recently, the molecular basis of ultra-rapid metabolism has been identified to be due to CYP2D6 gene amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Thus, the level of expression of a marker gene of the invention in an individual can be determined to thereby select appropriate agent(s) for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of the individual. In addition, pharmacogenetic studies can be used to apply genotyping of polymorphic alleles encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes to the identification of an individual&apos;s drug responsiveness phenotype. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a modulator of expression of a marker gene of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> C. Monitoring Clinical Trials </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drug compounds) on the level of expression of a marker gene of the invention can be applied not only in basic drug screening, but also in clinical trials. For example, the effectiveness of an agent to affect marker gene expression can be monitored in clinical trials of subjects receiving treatment for ovarian cancer. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment of a subject with an agent (e.g., an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetic, protein, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other drug candidate) comprising the steps of (i) obtaining a pre-administration sample from a subject prior to administration of the agent; (ii) detecting the level of expression of one or more selected marker genes of the invention in the pre-administration sample; (iii) obtaining one or more post-administration samples from the subject; (iv) detecting the level of expression of the marker gene(s) in the post-administration samples; (v) comparing the level of expression of the marker gene(s) in the pre-administration sample with the level of expression of the marker gene(s) in the post-administration sample or samples; and (vi) altering the administration of the agent to the subject accordingly. For example, increased administration of the agent can be desirable to increase expression of the marker gene(s) to higher levels than detected, i.e., to increase the effectiveness of the agent. Alternatively, decreased administration of the agent can be desirable to decrease expression of the marker gene(s) to lower levels than detected, i.e., to decrease the effectiveness of the agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> D. Surrogate Marker Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The marker genes of the invention may serve as surrogate marker genes for one or more disorders or disease states or for conditions leading up to disease states, and in particular, ovarian cancer. As used herein, a &ldquo;surrogate marker gene&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker gene which correlates with the absence or presence of a disease or disorder, or with the progression of a disease or disorder (e g., with the presence or absence of a tumor). The presence or quantity of such marker genes is independent of the disease. Therefore, these marker genes may serve to indicate whether a particular course of treatment is effective in lessening a disease state or disorder. Surrogate marker genes are of particular use when the presence or extent of a disease state or disorder is difficult to assess through standard methodologies (e.g., early stage tumors), or when an assessment of disease progression is desired before a potentially dangerous clinical endpoint is reached (e.g., an assessment of cardiovascular disease may be made using cholesterol levels as a surrogate marker gene, and an analysis of HIV infection may be made using HIV RNA levels as a surrogate marker gene, well in advance of the undesirable clinical outcomes of myocardial infarction or fully-developed AIDS). Examples of the use of surrogate marker genes in the art include: Koomen et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>J. Alass. Spectrom. </italic></highlight>35: 258-264; and James (1994) <highlight><italic>AIDS Treatment News Archive </italic></highlight>209. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The marker genes of the invention are also useful as pharmacodynamic marker genes. As used herein, a &ldquo;pharmacodynamic marker gene&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker gene which correlates specifically with drug effects. The presence or quantity of a pharmacodynamic marker gene is not related to the disease state or disorder for which the drug is being administered; therefore, the presence or quantity of the marker gene is indicative of the presence or activity of the drug in a subject. For example, a pharmacodynamic marker gene may be indicative of the concentration of the drug in a biological tissue, in that the marker gene is either expressed or transcribed or not expressed or transcnbed in that tissue in relationship to the level of the drug. In this fashion, the distribution or uptake of the drug may be monitored by the pharmacodynamic marker gene. Similarly, the presence or quantity of the pharmacodynamic marker gene may be related to the presence or quantity of the metabolic product of a drug, such that the presence or quantity of the marker gene is indicative of the relative breakdown rate of the drug in vivo. Pharmacodynamic marker genes are of particular use in increasing the sensitivity of detection of drug effects, particularly when the drug is administered in low doses. Since even a small amount of a drug may be sufficient to activate multiple rounds of marker gene transcription or expression, the amplified marker gene may be in a quantity which is more readily detectable than the drug itself Also, the marker gene may be more easily detected due to the nature of the marker gene itself; for example, using the methods described herein, antibodies may be employed in an immune-based detection system for a protein marker gene, or marker gene-specific radiolabeled probes may be used to detect a mRNA marker gene. Furthermore, the use of a pharmacodynarnic marker gene may offer mechanism-based prediction of risk due to drug treatment beyond the range of possible direct observations. Examples of the use of pharmacodynamic marker genes in the art include: Matsuda et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,862; Hattis et al (1991) <highlight><italic>Env. Health Perspect. </italic></highlight>90: 229-238; Schentag (1999) <highlight><italic>Am J Health-Syst Pharm. </italic></highlight>56 Suppl. 3: S21-S24; and Nicolau (1999) <highlight><italic>Am, J. Health-Syst Pharm. </italic></highlight>56 Suppl. 3: S16-S20. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> The marker genes of the invention are also useful as pharmacogenomic marker genes. As used herein, a &ldquo;pharmacogenomic marker gene&rdquo; is an objective biochemical marker gene which correlates with a specific clinical drug response or susceptibility in a subject (see, e.g., McLeod et al (1999) <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>35(12): 1650-1652). The presence or quantity of the pharmacogenomic marker gene is related to the predicted response of the subject to a specific drug or class of drugs prior to administration of the drug. By assessing the presence or quantity of one or more pharmacogenomic marker genes in a subject, a drug therapy which is most appropriate for the subject, or which is predicted to have a greater degree of success, may be selected. For example, based on the presence or quantity of RNA or protein for specific tumor marker genes in a subject, a drug or course of treatment may be selected that is optimized for the treatment of the specific tumor likely to be present in the subject. Similarly, the presence or absence of a specific sequence mutation in marker gene DNA may correlate with drug response. The use of pharmacogenomic marker genes therefore permits the application of the most appropriate treatment for each subject without having to administer the therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> VI. Electronic Apparatus Readable Media and Arrays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Electronic apparatus readable media comprising an ovarian cancer marker gene of the present invention is also provided. As used herein, &ldquo;electronic apparatus readable media&rdquo; refers to any suitable medium for storing, holding or containing data or information that can be read and accessed directly by an electronic apparatus. Such media can include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media, such as floppy discs, hard disc storage medium, and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as compact disc; electronic storage media such as RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM and the like; general hard disks and hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media. The medium is adapted or configured for having recorded thereon a marker gene of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;electronic apparatus&rdquo; is intended to include any suitable computing or processing apparatus or other device configured or adapted for storing data or information. Examples of electronic apparatus suitable for use with the present invention include stand-alone computing apparatus; networks, including a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) Internet, Intranet, and Extranet; electronic appliances such as a personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular phone, pager and the like; and local and distributed processing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; refers to a process for storing or encoding information on the electronic apparatus readable medium. Those skilled in the art can readily adopt any of the presently known methods for recording information on known media to generate manufactures comprising the marker genes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> A variety of software programs and formats can be used to store the marker gene information of the present invention on the electronic apparatus readable medium. For example, the nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the marker genes can be represented in a word processing text file, formatted in commercially-available software such as WordPerfect and MicroSoft Word, or represented in the form of an ASCII file, stored in a database application, such as DB2, Sybase, Oracle, or the like, as well as in other forms. Any number of dataprocessor structuring formats (e.g., text file or database) may be employed in order to obtain or create a medium having recorded thereon the marker genes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> By providing the marker genes of the invention in readable form, one can routinely access the marker gene sequence information for a variety of purposes. For example, one skilled in the art can use the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of the present invention in readable form to compare a target sequence or target structural motif with the sequence information stored within the data storage means. Search means are used to identify fragments or regions of the sequences of the invention which match a particular target sequence or target motif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore provides a medium for holding instructions for performing a method for determining whether a subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer, wherein the method comprises the steps of determining the presence or absence of an ovarian cancer marker gene and based on the presence or absence of the ovarian cancer marker gene, determining whether the subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer and/or recommending a particular treatment for the ovarian cancer or pre-ovarian cancer condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides in an electronic system and/or in a network, a method for determining whether a subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer associated with an ovarian cancer marker gene wherein the method comprises the steps of determining the presence or absence of the ovarian cancer marker gene, and based on the presence or absence of the ovarian cancer marker gene, determining whether the subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer, and/or recommending a particular treatment for the ovarian cancer or pre-ovarian cancer condition. The method may further comprise the step of receiving phenotypic information associated with the subject and/or acquiring from a network phenotypic information associated with the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides in a network, a method for determining whether a subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer associated with an ovarian cancer marker gene, said method comprising the steps of receiving information associated with the ovarian cancer marker gene receiving phenotypic information associated with the subject, acquiring information from the network corresponding to the ovarian cancer marker gene and/or ovarian cancer, and based on one or more of the phenotypic information, the ovarian cancer marker gene, and the acquired information, determining whether the subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer. The method may further comprise the step of recommending a particular treatment for the ovarian cancer or pre-ovarian cancer condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a business method for determining whether a subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer, said method comprising the steps of receiving information associated with the ovarian cancer marker gene, receiving phenotypic information associated with the subject, acquiring information from the network corresponding to the ovarian cancer marker gene and/or ovarian cancer, and based on one or more of the phenotypic information, the ovarian cancer marker gene, and the acquired information, determining whether the subject has ovarian cancer or a pre-disposition to ovarian cancer. The method may further comprise the step of recommending a particular treatment for the ovarian cancer or pre-ovarian cancer condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes an array comprising an ovarian cancer marker gene of the present invention. The array can be used to assay expression of one or more genes in the array. In one embodiment, the array can be used to assay gene expression in a tissue to ascertain tissue specificity of genes in the array. In this manner, up to about 7600 genes can be simultaneously assayed for expression. This allows a profile to be developed showing a battery of genes specifically expressed in one or more tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> In addition to such qualitative determination, the invention allows the quantitation of gene expression. Thus, not only tissue specificity, but also the level of expression of a battery of genes in the tissue is ascertainable. Thus, genes can be grouped on the basis of their tissue expression per se and level of expression in that tissue. This is useful, for example, in ascertaining the relationship of gene expression between or among tissues. Thus, one tissue can be perturbed and the effect on gene expression in a second tissue can be determined. In this context, the effect of one cell type on another cell type in response to a biological stimulus can be determined. Such a determination is useful, for example, to know the effect of cell-cell interaction at the level of gene expression. If an agent is administered therapeutically to treat one cell type but has an undesirable effect on another cell type, the invention provides an assay to determine the molecular basis of the undesirable effect and thus provides the opportunity to co-administer a counteracting agent or otherwise treat the undesired effect. Similarly, even within a single cell type, undesirable biological effects can be determined at the molecular level. Thus, the effects of an agent on expression of other than the target gene can be ascertained and counteracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the array can be used to monitor the time course of expression of one or more genes in the array. This can occur in various biological contexts, as disclosed herein, for example development of ovarian cancer, progression of ovarian cancer, and processes, such a cellular transformation associated with ovarian cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The array is also useful for ascertaining the effect of the expression of a gene on the expression of other genes in the same cell or in different cells. This provides, for example, for a selection of alternate molecular targets for therapeutic intervention if the ultimate or downstream target cannot be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> The array is also useful for ascertaining differential expression patterns of one or more genes in normal and abnormal cells. This provides a battery of genes that could serve as a molecular target for diagnosis or therapeutic intervention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Nylon arrays were prepared by spotting purified PCR product onto a nylon membrane using a robotic gridding system linked to a sample database. Several thousand clones were spotted on each nylon filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> RNA or DNA from clinical samples (tumor and normal), and cell lines as well as from subtracted libraries, were used for hybridization against the nylon arrays. The RNA or DNA is labeled utilizing an in vitro reverse transcription reaction that contains a radiolabeled nucleotide that is incorporated during the reaction. Hybridization experiments were carried out by combining labeled RNA or DNA samples with nylon filters in a hybridization chamber. Duplicate, independent hybridization experiments were performed to generate transcriptional profiling data. See, <highlight><italic>Nature Genetics, </italic></highlight>21 (1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> The level of expression of numerous potential marker genes (i.e. &ldquo;the marker genes of the invention&rdquo;) in cells obtained from 58 ovarian tumor samples (i.e., 43 late stage serous, 8 late stage endometroid, and 7 mixed (e.g., serous, transitional, undifferentiated cells and mixed serous and clear cells)) were compared with levels of expression of the same marker genes in four non-cancerous ovarian cell samples. Marker genes for which significant increases in the levels of expression in cancer-related samples relative non-cancerous samples were observed and listed in Table 1. </paragraph>
