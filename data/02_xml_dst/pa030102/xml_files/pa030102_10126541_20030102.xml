<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for manufacturing a film bulk acoustic wave filter, wherein a single-layer high-acoustic-impedance reflection layer is applied for the film bulk acoustic wave, for example, a diamond film with single-layer high-acoustic-impedance or a BCB film with single-layer low-acoustic-impedance is used as a reflection layer under the film bulk acoustic wave device in order to replace the cavity-reflective construction or the multi-layer reflection construction that are presently used; thus, there is no need for etching the cavity, the steadiness of the device and the yield of the device can be improved, and the FOM (figure of merit) of the film acoustic wave device is also improved; further, as there is no backside etching and front-side etching proceeded, the size of die is reduced greatly, so it is advantageous to mass production. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a film bulk acoustic wave filter, especially to a steady film bulk acoustic wave filter and the manufacturing method thereof, wherein the reflection layer under the bulk acoustic wave device is formed by single-layer high-acoustic-impedance reflection film, so that the manufacturing processes are simplified, the size of the die is reduced, and the efficiency of the device is improved. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The mobile communication is so vigorously developed that speed up the requirement of the RF (radio frequency) wireless electronic device. The mobile ability of the wireless communication product is depended on the size of device and the lifetime of battery. Also the devices manufacturers are dedicated to develop the tiny, cheaper and the more well performance devices. The finally step to microminiaturize the device is to integrate it with IC to form a system on chip (SOC). Presently, in the HF front-end of the wireless system, one of the devices that still can not be integrated with the IC, is RF front-end filter. In the future, the RF front-end filter will be the occupied space and the necessary device in the double, triple or multiple-band standards. The multiplexer obtained by associating the RF switch with RF front-end filter would be the key to decide the communication quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The ordinarily used RF front-end filter is the surface acoustic filter. In the past, the surface acoustic filter is not only to be the RF front-end filter but also to be the channel selective filter in the IF (intermediate-frequency) band. But in accompany with the development of the direct conversion technique (that is, the zero-IF or near zero-IF technique), it does not need more analog IF filter, so the application of the surface acoustic filter can only be extended to the RF filter. But the surface acoustic filter itself has the larger insertion loss and it has worse power dissipation stand. In the past, the insertion loss standard in the use of IF band selective filter is not rigorous, and the IF band belongs to the RF back-end so that it is not necessary to use a well power dissipation stand. But now, if it is used in the RF front-end, the aforementioned both standards will be the problem to the surface acoustic filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the problem, the Sumitomo Electric company in Japan disclosed the growing across finger electrode on the Zinc Oxide/Diamond/Silicon substrate. It used the high spring constant and well thermal conductivity of the Diamond, so the across finger electrode on the compound substrate could stand about 35 dBm dissipation and still could maintain the well linearity. But it is rather expensive about the Diamond substrate, and the line pitch of the across finger electrode is below micrometer, and it has the lower error tolerance and expensive in the equipment investment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The other product of RF filter is the Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC). The Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) owns the best benefit of higher stand to the RF dissipation. However, it still has other problems that have to be solved, such as: the difficulty in measurement, and not easy to get the ceramic powder from the upper company, and the ceramic happened the shrinkage phenomenon in the manufacturing processes that the deviations of products were caused and it is difficult to modify. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently, the technique about the bulk acoustic wave filter device, such as the Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) device (refer to the U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,818) developed by HP company, and the Stack Bulk Acoustic Resonator (SBAR;) device (refer to the U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,493) provided by Nokia company, which could diminish the volume of the high efficiency filter product, and it could operate in 400 MHz to 10 GHz frequency band. The diplexer using in the CDMA mobile phone is one kind of said filter product. The size of the bulk acoustic wave filter is just a part to the ceramic diplexer, and it owns better rejection, insertion loss, and power management ability than the surface acoustic filter. The combination of those properties could make the manufacturer produce high performance, up-to-date, and mini-type wireless mobile communication equipment. The bulk acoustic wave filter is a semi-conductor technique, so it could integrate the filter into the RFIC, and to form the system on chip (SOC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is necessary to form a vacant construction below the resonator in the FBAR device. In general, a developed way is to fabricate the vacant construction by backside etching or front-side etching the substrate. As the backside etching is being proceeded, the density of the devices thereof is restricted greatly. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> supporting layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode pattern <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, a piezoelectric material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode metal pattern <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed sequentially. Thereafter, rear etching is proceeded to form a cavity <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the desired resonator region. It needs more time for backside etching since the etching depth of backside etching is relatively deep; and it also needs quite a long time for front-side etching since the side etching is performed from the side of non-crystalline to excavate the substrate below the resonator. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> supporting layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a lower electrode pattern <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;, a piezoelectric material layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode metal pattern <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed sequentially onto the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, front-side etching is proceeded to form a cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the desired resonator region, and the silicon substrate residue <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is remained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing the bulk acoustic wave filter proceeded with front-side etching by using a sacrificial layer according to the U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,818 of the HP company. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bulk acoustic wave filter device can be formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. First, a cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mask defined and etched on the substrate. Then a sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is deposited onto this region. Then the sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is performed with polishing process by using the methods of chemical-mechanical milling. Afterwards, the supporting layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the lower electrode patterns <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime;, the piezoelectical material layers <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the upper electrode metal patterns <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed sequentially onto the construction. Then, front etching is being performed on the desired resonator region to remove the sacrifice layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and a cavity <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed, so that the device properties would not be influenced by the substrate. There are disadvantages that the sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> should have a specified thickness in order to form a cavity deep enough for avoiding the influence of the substrate. And the smoothening process, such as being pre-grooved on the substrate and the chemical-mechanical milling process to the sacrifice layer, is necessary for proceeding the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Besides, in general, there is a problem with the FBAR devices while front-side etching. That is, the upper electrode patterns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the lower electrode patterns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;, the piezoelectric material layers <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the supporting layers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have to be etched in order to form etching windows <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so that the etchant can pass through the etching windows <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to form the cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, it is difficult to form patterns onto the piezoelectric material layers. The conventional way is by metal mask, ion milling dry etching, or laser machining. Such methods have difficulties in cost and processes, and are very difficult to achieve large-area etching and etching uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In SBAR device, although the vacant construction is not necessary to be formed below the resonator, a multi-layer film is necessary to be grown. Such processes are rather complicated and not advantageous to integration. The selection of the materials for the Bragg reflection layer is restricted, so the device yield is relative low, but it still has an advantage of multiple selectivity of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a stack bulk acoustic resonator device developed by the Nokia Company (referring to the U.S. Pat. No. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>872</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight>). As shown in the figure, the bulk acoustic resonator device can be formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the buffer layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the high-acoustic-impedance layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the low-acoustic-impedance layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed sequentially and alternately, so that a stacked construction having a thickness of quarter wavelength is grown. Afterwards, the lower electrode metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the piezoelectric layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the upper electrode metal pattern layer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are formed sequentially onto this construction. Such method has an advantage according to the substrate properties. That is, since the acoustic wave is spreaded completely in the piezoelectric layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on the substrate, so that there is no substrate effect occurred. In addition, not as the cavity construction that there is an etching through-hole or an area occupied by the wafer for back-side etching is preset on the layout of the device, so that the area of the product can be reduced. However, in order to restrict the acoustic wave within the piezoelectric layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> effectively, a stacked construction, which is alternately grown with several high-acoustic-impedance layers and several low-acoustic-impedance layers, each has a thickness of quarter wavelength, is used as a reflection surface. As the losses of the acoustic wave between the stacked layers of the construction are rather large, and as the interfacial effect between the multi-layer films of the stacked construction is influential, the quality of the devices may be lowered greatly. Therefore, the structure with multi-layer films is disadvantageous to the quality of the devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> are the cross-sectional views of the bulk acoustic filter using rear etching and front etching according to the conventional technology and have been described already, so they are not repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5E</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views of the reflection layer of the film bulk acoustic wave device formed by single-layer high-acoustic-impedance reflection layer according to the first embodiment of the present invention. There is no need for etching the sacrificial layer or the substrate for the whole process. Since the film surface is maintained smooth, the electrode and the piezoelectric material layer are quality assured. Thus a steady device is achieved, and the yield is improved. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the bulk acoustic wave filter can be formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Firstly, a single-layer high-acoustic-impedance reflection layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is deposited onto the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Then, the lower electrode layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the piezoelectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the upper electrode metal pattern layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are formed sequentially on this construction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C through 5E</cross-reference>. Generally, since the path of the acoustic wave is also composed by the supporting layer, the quality of the device must be lowered. In this embodiment, as the bulk acoustic wave device with vacant construction is not applied, a supporting layer for supporting the film should be grown, so that the quality of the device is improved greatly. In addition, this embodiment has the advantages of the multi-layer SBAR (stack bulk acoustic resonator) devices, that is, since the acoustic wave on the substrate is spreaded completely inside the piezoelectric layer, there is no need to consider with the properties of the substrate, and there is no substrate effect completely. Meanwhile, not as the bulk acoustic wave device with cavity construction, it is no need to consider with complicated formula of the etchant, such as the etching selection rate of the substrate and the acoustic wave materials, etc., and the complication of construction thereof. The high-acoustic-impedance reflection layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of this embodiment can be a low-acoustic-impedance film such as BCB film, polymide film, or a high-acoustic-impedance hard film such as a diamond-like film or a diamond film, or other kinds of hard film and extra-hard film such as TiCN, TiN, TiAlN, CrN, ZrN. The hard film has advantages such as high hardness, extremely high acoustic impedance, low rubbing coefficient, excellent electric insulation, and shows extremely high efficiencies in thermal conductivity, acid resistance and alkaline resistance, chemical inactivity, optical permeability, bio-capacity, smoothness and abrasion resistance. Because of these superior properties, it is more extensively applied to mechanical, electrical, semiconductor industries. A plasma with a relative low temperature can be applied to assist the deposition such as PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition), ion beam evaporating, electric-arc ion depositing, non-equilibrium magnetron spilling evaporating, etc. Wherein, the diamond-like film has an excellent smoothness (Ra&lt;10 nm). It is extensively applied to the industry as protection layers for optical lenses, masks of missiles, windows of aircraft, CD-ROMs or disks for computers, the integrated circuits, molds, dicing tools, high density capacitance, and bio-medical materials. The detailed specifications of the diamond-like film are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (1) high hardness (3,000 to 6,000 kgmm-2) </paragraph>
