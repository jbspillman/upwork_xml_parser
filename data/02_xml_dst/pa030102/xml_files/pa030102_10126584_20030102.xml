<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the benefit of Application No. P1999-43252, filed in Korea on Oct. 7, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor memory, and more particularly, to nonvolatile memory, in which a flash memory cell having two floating gates is provided for storing a significant amount of information per cell, and a method for sensing data therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, there is a volatile memory which permits erasing stored information and saving new information and a nonvolatile memory which permits storing information only once. In the volatile memory, there are RAM data which are writable thereto and readable therefrom, and in the nonvolatile memory, there are ROM (Read Only Memory), EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM), and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) data. The ROM cannot be programmed again once information is stored, but the EPROM and EEPROM can be programmed again once information stored therein is erased. The EPROM and EEPROM have the same information programming operation, but different information erasing operation. The EPROM erases information stored therein using a U.V. ray, while the EEPROM erases information stored therein using electricity. Keeping pace with demands for a large-sized memory according to the development of the information industry, DRAM is the most widely used as a mass storage media. However, DRAM requires a storage capacitor above a certain size which requires periodic refreshment. Accordingly, instead of DRAM, there have been extensive studies on EEPROM which requires no refreshment. However, since EEPROM also permits writing either &lsquo;1&rsquo; or &lsquo;0&rsquo; thereon, a device packing density corresponds to a number of memory cells. Therefore, when it is intended to use EEPROM as data storage media, the greatest problem is that the cost per bit is too high. In order to solve this problem, there is active research on a multi-bit memory cell. The multi-bit memory cell permits significantly increased data storage density in the same area of a chip without reducing memory cell size by storing two or more than two data in one memory cell. The multi-bit memory cell is programmed in multiple stages of threshold voltage levels. That is, in order to program two bits of data in one cell, each of the cells should be programmed in four stages of threshold voltage levels as is known from 2<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;4. In this instance, the threshold levels in each cell correspond to logic states of 00, 01, 10, and 11. Accordingly, in order to increase a number of bits per cell by programming the cell in more levels, dispersion of each of the threshold voltage levels should be reduced by adjusting the threshold voltage levels precisely. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Next, methods for sensing cells having one bit information which have two states, and cells having two bit information, which have four states, will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, TABLE 2, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>, and TABLE 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When one bit information is stored, a case where a cell current is higher than a reference current is defined as &lsquo;0 state&rsquo; and a case where the cell current is lower than the reference current is defined as &lsquo;1 state&rsquo;, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and TABLE 2. The cell and reference currents are a result of measuring I-V characteristics of a flash memory cell where one reference threshold voltage is set. Since writing to many flash memory cells is conducted, the states show a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> that provides a read allowance (a value divided by two of a value obtained by subtracting a maximum current in the &lsquo;1 state&rsquo; from a minimum current in the &lsquo;0 state&rsquo;). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, first and second threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have a distribution of &lsquo;0&rsquo; and &lsquo;1&rsquo; states, respectively. It is preferable that the read allowance is as large as possible for maintaining information in the flash memory cell, which requires narrower dispersions &lsquo;W&rsquo; of the &lsquo;0 state&rsquo; and &lsquo;1 state&rsquo; threshold voltages, with a greater difference between the dispersions. By doing this, an allowance for setting the reference threshold voltage for reading a state of information stored in the flash memory cell becomes great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A method for reading information from a flash memory cell having two bit information stored therein will be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates cell states at threshold voltages according to a second method of the related art, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates cell states at control gate voltages and reference currents accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, in the related art two bit information sensing, a cell current is compared to first, second, and third reference currents (the first reference current being greater than the second reference current being greater than the third reference current), to represent as a &lsquo;00&rsquo; state when the cell current is greater than the first reference current, to represent as a &lsquo;01&rsquo; state when the cell current is greater than the second reference current and smaller than the first reference current, to represent as a &lsquo;10&rsquo; state when the cell current is greater than the third reference current and smaller than the second reference current, and to represent as &lsquo;11&rsquo; state when the cell current is smaller than the third reference current. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, illustrating current-voltage characteristic curves, there are first, second, third, and fourth threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and Vth<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo;, and &lsquo;11&rsquo; states, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the first, second, third and fourth threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and Vth<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo;, and &lsquo;11&rsquo; dispersion states, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the related art nonvolatile memory and the method for sensing data therefrom has the following problems. First, in implementing a multi-bit cell in a flash memory cell, a difference of threshold voltages between states should be great for maintaining a great read allowance. The great difference of threshold voltages leads a control gate voltage higher, which increases a probability of electron leakage from a floating gate, which, in turn, causes the cell state to become unstable. Second, when a high voltage is provided to a control gate in order to obtain a greater read allowance, peripheral circuits become larger and more complicated. Third, since the storage of three bit information per one flash memory cell requires a higher control gate voltage and much time and effort to reduce dispersion of the threshold voltage, the storage of information of more than three bits is difficult. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A method for sensing data using the aforementioned nonvolatile memory will be explained with reference to Table 4 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Before explaining the data sensing operation, a flash memory cell of the present invention has two states for one threshold voltage with respect to a first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The two states for one threshold voltage are defined as different color states, that is called that the two states are degenerated for one threshold voltage. In this embodiment, &lsquo;the different color states&rsquo; is defined as states when there are electrons present in a second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and when there are no electrons present in the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that can be identified by current flowing through the second channel when the voltage is provided to the second control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>For example, a case is defined as &lsquo;white&rsquo; when, after a voltage is provided to the wordline W/L, i.e., the first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for causing a current to flow to the first channel, the voltage is provided to the second control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to cause current flowing to the second channel. And, opposite to the &lsquo;white&rsquo;, is a case when there is no current flowing to the second channel and is defined as &lsquo;black&rsquo;. The &lsquo;white&rsquo; is represented as logic &lsquo;1&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;black&rsquo; is represented as logic &lsquo;0&rsquo;. By setting two threshold voltages for the flash memory, and setting &lsquo;black&rsquo; or &lsquo;white&rsquo; for each of the two threshold voltages, at least four kinds of information can be stored in the flash memory cell. According the definition above, since the floating gate is divided to the first and second floating gates <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a data state can be expressed in at least two bit data depending on states in which charges are stored or not in the first and second floating gates <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this embodiment, writing data on the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is defined as &lsquo;level writing&rsquo;, reading data is defined as &lsquo;level reading&rsquo;, and erasing data is defined as &lsquo;level erase&rsquo;. And, writing data on the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is defined as &lsquo;color writing&rsquo;, reading data is defined as &lsquo;color reading&rsquo;, and erasing data is defined as &lsquo;color erasing&rsquo;. The &lsquo;level writing&rsquo; implies injection of electrons into the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a selected flash memory cell, the &lsquo;level reading&rsquo; implies reading a threshold voltage of the flash memory cell stored in the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the selected flash memory cell, and the &lsquo;level erasing&rsquo; implies extraction of electrons from the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the flash memory cell along a drain line of the selected flash memory cell. And, the &lsquo;color writing&rsquo; implies injection of electrons to the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the selected flash memory cell, the &lsquo;color reading&rsquo; implies reading a color state of the flash memory cell formed by the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the selected flash memory cell, and the &lsquo;color erasing&rsquo; implies extraction of electrons from the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the flash memory cell along a source line of the selected flash memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned different operations in the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> selected from the nonvolatile memory of the present invention will be explained. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 6</cross-reference> and Table 4, in the &lsquo;level writing&rsquo;, a voltage of 10&tilde;12V is provided to the distinguish line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, to cause current to flow through the second channel under the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Then, after a voltage of 5&tilde;6V is provided to the bitline <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a bitline voltage is provided to the drainline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the drain selection transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A voltage of 5&tilde;10V is provided to the wordline <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to cause a current to flow through the first channel.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Two bit or three bit information may be stored in the nonvolatile memory of the present invention operative as above. As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for reading a state of a nonvolatile memory in a case where two bit information is stored in a flash memory cell will be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C illustrate a method of sensing two bit information from a nonvolatile memory according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> illustrate dispersions of threshold voltages according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Storage of two bit information in a nonvolatile memory cell having two floating gates may provide four states depending on statuses of charge storage in first and second floating gates <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>A method for sensing the four states will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A color reading operation is conducted, to detect current flowing through a second channel under the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and to read a color state. Then, a level writing operation is used in programming first and second threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In this embodiment, an adequately high voltage of 10&tilde;12V is always provided to a distinguish line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and current is kept flowing through the second channel. A reference voltage is set up between the first and the second threshold voltages. A sensed current through the cell is dependent on the programmed first and second threshold voltages. That is, upon providing a read voltage to the wordline <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having the different threshold voltages programmed thus generates currents corresponding to respective states The color state is read thus, and according to the read color state, &lsquo;level reading&rsquo; is conducted. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, when the color state is &lsquo;black&rsquo; or &lsquo;white&rsquo;, the cell current is compared to the reference current, representing as a &lsquo;0&rsquo; state when the cell current is greater than the reference current, and as a &lsquo;1&rsquo; state when the cell current is smaller than the reference current. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the &lsquo;white state&rsquo; has a higher threshold voltage provided to the control gate than the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; at which no current is in storage. When the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the &lsquo;black state&rsquo;, the flash memory cell may be in &lsquo;00&rsquo; or &lsquo;01&rsquo; state. And, when the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the &lsquo;white state&rsquo;, the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be in &lsquo;10&rsquo; or &lsquo;11&rsquo; state. As has been explained, when two bit information can be stored in one flash memory cell. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be sensed in four states of &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo;, or &lsquo;11&rsquo;. Upon finishing the level writing on the flash memory cell, the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has threshold voltage dispersions according to the states that provide read allowances. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C, the read allowance is a value obtained by subtracting a maximum current in &lsquo;1&rsquo; state from a minimum current in &lsquo;0&rsquo; state and dividing by two. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows dispersions of &lsquo;0&rsquo; state and &lsquo;1&rsquo; state in first and second threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively under the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; in which no current flows through a second channel under a second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, a first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows dispersions of &lsquo;0&rsquo; state and &lsquo;1&rsquo; state in first and second threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively under the &lsquo;white state&rsquo; in which current flows through a second channel under a second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this embodiment, a greater difference between the first and second threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or smaller dispersion widths W will provide greater read allowances Thus, the flash memory cell having two bit information stored therein may be sensed in four states of &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo;, or &lsquo;11&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A method for sensing a nonvolatile memory in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained when a flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has three bit information stored therein. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C illustrate a method of sensing three bit information from a nonvolatile memory according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> illustrate dispersions of threshold voltages according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Storage of three bit information in a nonvolatile memory cell having two floating gates may be in eight different states coming from a combination of two color states depending on presence of a charge in a second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and four states in storing two bit information in a first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Methods of sensing the eight states will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> First, color reading is conducted, and current flow in a second channel under the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is detected to read a color state. Then, level writing is used in programming first, second, third, and fourth threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and Vth<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a distinguish line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> always has an adequately high voltage of 10&tilde;12V provided thereto for causing current to flow through the second channel. First, second, and third reference voltages Vref<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vref<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and Vref<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are set between the first, second, third, and fourth threshold voltages, respectively. In this embodiment, cell current is vaned with the programmed threshold voltage. That is, upon providing a read voltage to the wordline <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a first floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has different threshold voltages programmed therein thus generating currents pertinent to the different states. Then, respective level readings are conducted according to the color states read by detecting currents flowing through the second channel. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, when the color state is &lsquo;black&rsquo; or &lsquo;white&rsquo;, respective cell currents are compared to the first, second, and third reference currents, to represent a case when the cell current is greater than the first reference current as &lsquo;00&rsquo; state, a case when the cell current is greater than the second reference current and smaller than the first reference current as &lsquo;01&rsquo; state, a case when the cell current is greater than the third reference current and smaller than the second reference current as &lsquo;10&rsquo;, and a case when the cell current is smaller than the third reference current as &lsquo;11&rsquo; state. As shown in the I-V curve in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; has a threshold voltage lower than the &lsquo;white state&rsquo;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, when the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; is represented with &lsquo;0&rsquo;, the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have four states of &lsquo;000&rsquo;, &lsquo;001&rsquo;, &lsquo;010&rsquo;, and &lsquo;011&rsquo;. And, when the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; is represented with &lsquo;1&rsquo;, the flash memory cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have four states of &lsquo;100&rsquo;, &lsquo;101&rsquo;, &lsquo;110&rsquo;, and &lsquo;111&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows four dispersions of &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo; and &lsquo;11&rsquo; states in a first, second, third, and fourth threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and Vth<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively under the &lsquo;black state&rsquo; in which no current flows through a second channel under a second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference>, the first control gate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows four dispersions of &lsquo;00&rsquo;, &lsquo;01&rsquo;, &lsquo;10&rsquo; and &lsquo;11&rsquo; states in the first, second, third, and fourth threshold voltages Vth<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Vth<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and Vth<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively under the &lsquo;white state&rsquo; in which a current flows through the second channel under the second floating gate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this embodiment, a greater difference between the first to fourth threshold voltages or smaller dispersion widths W will provide greater read allowances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned nonvolatile memory, cell array thereof, and method for sensing a data therefrom have the following advantages. First, because the read allowance for two bits in the present invention is the same with the read allowance for one bit in the related art, and the read allowance for three bits in the present invention is the same with the read allowance for two bits in the related art, the present invention can provide a greater read allowance in storing information of the same size. Second, because the present invention permits storing three bit information for one flash memory cell, which is difficult to implement in the related art, a 256 Mbit flash chip can be embodied by using a process of fabricating 64 bit flash chip which stores one bit per cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the nonvolatile memory, cell array thereof, and method for sensing data therefrom of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
