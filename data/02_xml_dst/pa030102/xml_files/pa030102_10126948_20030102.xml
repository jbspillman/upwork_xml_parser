<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a photocurable resin composition and a plastic sheet having a surface coated by cured coating of the photocurable resin composition. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, interior materials for houses, particularly ornamental panels for doors, walls, and ceilings, as well as exterior materials for furniture, are gaining value in terms of design, the function of preventing adherence of stains, high gloss, and the like. Paint or varnish has conventionally been used for preventing stains from adhering or for imparting gloss to the surface of panels and furniture However, applying paint or varnish requires solvents which not only affect the work environment and health of workers, but also decrease work efficiency. Development of an alternative technology has therefore been desired In recent years a technology of attaching plastic sheets of polyethylene terephthalate or polycarbonate as exterior materials has been used as a method of providing gloss and increasing design value with good work efficiency without using a solvent. However, although plastic sheets provide good work efficiency, excellent gloss, the plastic sheets usually lack satisfactional prevention of stain adherence, surface hardness and are easily damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More recently, a technology of applying a photo-curable resin coating to plastic sheets such as polystyrene sheets, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer sheets, polyethylene terephthalate sheets, or polycarbonate sheets to provide a lens configuration has been developed. Such plastic sheets are used as prism lens sheets to increase the luminance of a liquid crystal display or used as Frensel lens for projection TVs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One method attempted to overcome the above problem was applying a UV curable resin composition to plastic sheets and curing the composition to produce a coating which prevents the plastic sheet surface from being stained and damaged. However, conventional photocurable resin compositions produce optical interference fringes (irises) on the plastic sheets after application and curing, impairing the appearance and decreasing the design value. No satisfactory technology has as yet been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, when a plastic sheet is provided with a lens configuration using a photocurable resin composition, a decrease in luminance and change in color due to reflection may occur at the interface of the plastic sheet and the coating material if their refractive indexes greatly differ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a photocurable resin composition exhibiting stain-proof and damage-proof functions without producing optical interference fringes when coated on the surfaces of plastic sheets such as polystyrene, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, polyethylene terephthalate, and polycarbonate. Another object of the present invention is to provide a plastic sheet suitable as an exterior material for ornamental panels and furniture, and a plastic lens sheet exhibiting high luminance without change in color, using the photocurable resin composition. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have conducted extensive studies relative to the cause of interference fringes produced when a conventional photocurable resin composition is coated on a plastic sheet made from polystyrene, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, or the like. As a result, the inventors have found that the interference fringes are caused by the difference in the refractive index of the plastic sheet and that of the coating material, and that the surface of the plastic sheet can be coated without causing interference fringes if the refractive index of the coating material is between 1.56 and 1.65. The inventors have further found that such a coating can provide a plastic sheet suitable as a stain/damage proof interior construction material for houses, particularly ornamental panels for doors, walls, and ceilings, as well as exterior materials for furniture, with a target design value, or a plastic lens sheet suitable for use as a prism lens sheet or a Fresnel lens sheet with high luminance and less change in color. Such findings led to the completion of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The problems of the prior art have been solved by applying a photocurable resin composition suitable for forming a cured film on a plastic substrate, wherein the cured film obtainable by photocuring the photocurable resin composition has a refractive index between 1,56 and 1,65. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a plastic sheet having a surface coated with a cured coating of the photocurable resin composition </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in Table 1, the photocurable resin compositions in which the components (A), (B), and (C) are incorporated had a refractive index between 1.56 and 1.65 without producing interference fringes. The composition is therefore useful as a stain-proof and damage-proof surface coating material without producing interference fringes when coated on the surfaces of plastic sheets such as polystyrene, styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, polyethylene terephthalate, and polycarbonate. Because the plastic lens sheet prepared using the photocurable resin composition of the present invention exhibits high luminance without change in color, the sheet is useful as a backlight optical material for liquid display devices. </paragraph>
