<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an acetal group containing norbornene copolymer for use in a photoresist composition, a method for producing the same, and a photoresist composition containing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an acetal group containing norbornene copolymer that has improved properties and that includes norbornene or norbornene derivatives as its main chain. The invention also relates to an easy method for producing the copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lithography today has become a core technology in accomplishing large scale integrity of a memory semiconductor, DRAM. Specifically, improved lithography technology capable of forming finer patterns now is required in manufacturing VLSI (very large scale integrated circuit). In order to meet this requirement, it has become increasingly important to provide resist materials having high efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, photoresist compositions typically should exhibit transparency at an exposure wavelength, have excellent etching resistance, heat resistance and adhesion strength. In addition, photoresist compositions that are used in a lithography process with an excimer laser should be developable in a 2.38 weight % aqueous solution of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). It is very difficult, however, to synthesize a photoresist resin that satisfies all of these requirements. For example, acrylic polymers have attracted attention for their ease of synthesis and low light-absorptivity at a light wavelength of 200 or less nm, but they have poor dry etching resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the etch resistance of these acrylic polymers, alicyclic unit&apos;s have been introduced into the main chain or the side chain of acryl-based copolymers. Examples of alicyclic units introduced into the main chain of an acryl-based copolymer include norbornene, norbornene derivatives, cyclodiene and nortricyclene, and the like. Examples of alicyclic units introduced to the side chain of an acryl-based copolymer include isobornyl, menthyl, tricyclodecanyl, norbornyl, tetracyclododecyl, adamantyl and the like. Copolymers having alicyclic units introduced into its side chain usually have an acrylic polymer as its main chain, and the content of its alicyclic units typically is less than 50 weight % of the total copolymer. As a result, copolymers having alicyclic units in its side chain exhibit poor solubility in an alkaline aqueous solution, and exhibit poor adhesive strength to a substrate because alicyclic units introduced increase Tg (glass transition temperature) and hydrophobicity of the polymer. These copolymers also often suffer from problems due to fragility and poor sensitivity. On the other hand, copolymers having alicyclic units introduced into its main chain exhibit excellent dry-etching resistance and thermal properties and is advantageous because side chains having functionalities required for patterning can be introduced. Thus, many research has been conducted to obtain a matrix resin, of which the main chain is composed of an alicyclic structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, polymerization methods such as radical polymerization, cationic polymerization, addition polymerization, or ring-opening polymerization have been used to obtain the conventional multicyclic polymers such as norbornene polymers and norbornene derivative polymers. However, these methods are problematic in that the polymerization yield typically is low and their uses are restricted to monomers having polarity. Due to the complicated structures of most catalysts used for polarization, these methods may be affected by moisture during polymerization, and thus, only dry hydrocarbon solvents or dry halogenated aromatic solvents can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The description herein of certain disadvantages associated with known photoresist compositions and polymers used therein is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, the present invention may include some or all of the polymers and photoresist compositions described above, without suffering from the same disadvantages. </paragraph>
