<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Lactic acid and its salts can be used as components of food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agrichemicals. For example, lactic acid has been used in the production of confectionary products, beer, wine, dairy products, soft drinks, jams, salad dressings, and biodegradable polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Lactic acid can be produced by synthetic or fermentative methods. In synthetic methods, lactonitrile is converted to lactic acid. In fermentative methods, bacteria or other microorganisms produce lactic acid as they metabolize carbon-containing materials. For example, homofermentative bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, or Pediococcus can metabolize a carbon source, e.g., a carbohydrate, to produce lactic acid. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention provides novel, temperature-resistant strains of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae, </italic></highlight>and mutants thereof. These novel strains can be used to produce lactic acid at high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the invention features the <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>strains ADM34.31 (NRRL 30427), ADM47.26 (NRRL 30430), ADM48.6 (NRRL 30431), ADM48.80 (NRRL 30432), ADM50.48 (NRRL 30433), ADM34.34 (NRRL 30428), ADM34.89 (NRRL 30429), and ADM33.30 (NRRL 30426), as well as mutants thereof that convert a carbon source to lactic acid. Preferably, the mutant converts dextrose to lactic acid at a rate of at least 0.5 grams/Liter/hour at 40&deg; C. If desired, the strain may contain a genetically engineered vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>strains of the invention can be used in a method for producing lactic acid, the method comprising culturing the strain in a medium comprising a carbon source (e.g., a sugar or starch), and allowing the strain to metabolize the carbon source, thereby producing lactic acid. The lactic acid then can be isolated from the medium. Alternatively, the lactic acid can be converted to a lactate salt (e.g., calcium L-lactate, sodium L-lactate, potassium L-lactate, or ammonium L-lactate). The lactate salt subsequently can be isolated from the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, the strain is cultured at 38&deg; C. to 46&deg; C., e.g., at 40&deg; C. to 42&deg; C. In other embodiments, the strain is cultured at a first temperature and subsequently cultured at a second temperature, wherein the second temperature is higher than the first temperature. For example, the first temperature may be 28&deg; C. to 36&deg; C. (e.g., 32&deg; C. to 34&deg; C.), and the second temperature may be 38&deg; C. to 46&deg; C. (e.g., 40&deg; C. to 42&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the strain is cultured first under conditions that favor growth of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic></highlight>, and the strain is subsequently cultured under conditions that inhibit growth of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention also features a method for isolating colonies of Rhizopus sp., e.g., <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae. </italic></highlight>Colonies of Rhizopus can be isolated by providing a suspension of a Rhizopus strain in a solution comprising a detergent (e.g., a nonionic surfactant such as Triton X-100) or other agent that will inhibit aggregation of spores, transferring the suspension to a first LPM agar plate, incubating the strain on the plate for a time sufficient to allow the growth of Rhizopus colonies on the plate (e.g., 3 to 4 days, e.g., at a high temperature such as 38-46&deg; C. (e.g., 40&deg; C.) to slow mycelial growth), transferring at least one of the colonies to a second LPM agar plate, incubating the colony on the plate (e.g., for 2 days, e.g., at 38-46&deg; C. (e.g., 40&deg; C.)), and isolating a sector of the second LPM agar plate comprising all or a portion of the colony. For example, the sector can be isolated by using a plastic transfer pipette to pluck a section of agar from the plate. LPM agar plates include KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(about 0.6 g/L), MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (about 0.25 g/L), Zn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (about 0.005 g/L), (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(about 1 g/L), dextrose (about 5 g/L, adjusted to pH 5.5), and agar (about 15 g/L). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> If desired, the method can also include inoculating a potato-dextrose-agar (PDA) slant with the sector containing the Rhizopus. The PDA slant can be incubated for a time sufficient to allow the formation of Rhizopus spores. The method can also include isolating spores from the PDA slant and inoculating a medium with the isolated spores. If desired, the isolated spores may be suspended in a solution comprising a nonionic detergent (e.g., Triton X-100) prior to inoculating the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> If desired, the Rhizopus strain may be a strain of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic></highlight>, such as, without limitation, ADM34.31 (NRRL 30427), ADM47.26 (NRRL 30430), ADM48.6 (NRRL 30431), ADM48.80 (NRRL 30432), ADM50.48 (NRRL 30433), ADM34.34 (NRRL 30428), ADM34.89 (NRRL 30429), and ADM33.30 (NRRL 30426), or mutants thereof. Colonies of other Rhizopus stains also can be isolated, for example, by providing a suspension of Rhizopus that includes a plurality of mutant Rhizopus stains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention offers several advantages. The strains of the invention can be used at high temperatures for the production of lactic acid and/or its salts. By carrying out fermentation at a high temperature (e.g., 38&deg; C. to 46&deg; C.), the precipitation of lactate (e.g., calcium L-lactate), which can interfere with fermentation, is inhibited or prevented. Fermentation at high temperatures also provides higher titers of lactic acid production than does fermentation at conventional temperatures. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the invention, and from the claims. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention provides novel strains of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic></highlight>, which can be used, inter alia, in the production of lactic acid. Included within the invention are the novel strains: ADM34.31 (NRRL 30427), ADM47.26 (NRRL 30430), ADM48.6 (NRRL 30431), ADM48.80 (NRRL 30432), ADM50.48 (NRRL 30433), ADM34.34 (NRRL 30428), ADM34.89 (NRRL 30429), and ADM33.30 (NRRL 30426), as well as mutants thereof that convert a carbon source to lactic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The strains of the invention are temperature-resistant strains of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae. </italic></highlight>Such strains are capable of converting a carbon source (e.g. dextrose) to lactic acid when cultured at 40&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Mutant strains of the invention can be produced using conventional methods to mutagenize strain(s) ADM34.31 (NRRL 30427), ADM47.26 (NRRL 30430), ADM48.6 (NRRL 30431), ADM48.80 (NRRL 30432), ADM50.48 (NRRL 30433), ADM34.34 (NRRL 30428), ADM34.89 (NRRL 30429), and ADM33.30 (NRRL 30426). For example, mutagenesis can be carried out using N-methyl-N&prime;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), as described herein. Preferably, the mutant strains convert dextrose to lactic acid at 40&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Conventional media for growing <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>can be used in the methods of the invention. For example, to germinate mycelia, suspensions of Rhizopus spores can be cultured in a medium such as a seed medium (e.g., KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>0.6 g/L, MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.25 g/L, Zn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.088 g/L, CaCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>15 g/L, starch 25 g/L, dextrose 100 g/L, urea 2 g/L (filter sterilized separately), pH adjusted to 5.8). After the mycelia are germinated (typically in 16 to 30 hours), the mycelial seed can be transferred to a fermentation medium (e.g., MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 5 g/L, Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>0.001 g/L, Mn SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.02 g/L, KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>0.6 g/L, CaCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>67 g/L, dextrose 110 g/L, corn oil 1 mL/L, urea 1 g/L (filter sterilized separately), pH adjusted at 7.4). Other media in which <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>can grow can be used in the invention. For example, as an alternative to the use of dextrose, the medium may use an alternate carbon source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A variety of carbon-containing materials can be included in the medium as the carbon source that is metabolized by <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>into lactic acid. For example, sugars such as dextrose, glucose, or sucrose can be used. Also, carbon-containing raw materials such as barley, cassava, corn, oats, wheat, sorghum, molasses, cheese whey, milo, potato, rye, sweet potato, Jerusalem artichoke, rice or the like can be used. Other useful carbon sources include, without limitation, potato waste materials, grape juice, grape pomace, apple pomace, and raisins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> During culturing of <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic></highlight>, the pH of the medium preferably is controlled such that it remains between pH 4 and pH 6. The pH can be lowered by adding to the medium a basic substance, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide, which will neutralize the lactic acid and produce a lactate salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If desired, culturing of Rhizopus can be carried out in two or more stages. For example, the first stage of culturing may be carried out at about 28&deg; C. to 36&deg; C. (e.g., at 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35&deg; C.). Typically, this stage of culturing is carried out for about 10 to 24 hours (e.g., about 12 to 18 hours). Subsequently, the temperature of the culture is raised to about 38&deg; C. to 46&deg; C. (e.g., 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 or 45&deg; C.), and culturing is continued. Typically, the second stage of culturing also is carried out for about 10 to 60 hours (e.g., about 12 to 50 hours). Once the carbon source is metabolized into lactic acid, culturing typically is discontinued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an alternative two-stage method, the first stage utilizes culture conditions that are favorable for growth, and the second stage utilizes culture conditions that are favorable for lactic acid production and which conditions inhibit growth of the strain, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,185. In this method, the pH of the medium during the first stage is preferably kept near the optimum growth pH for <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic></highlight>, e.g., pH 4 to pH 6. An exemplary medium that is favorable for cell growth includes: glucose 80 g/L, yeast extract 48 g/L, MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 1.34 g/L, FeSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.06 g/L, MnSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.042 g/L, sodium acetate 1.23 g/L, and K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>0.062 g/L. Once the desired cell density has been reached, the fermentative production of lactic acid is conducted under conditions that inhibit growth of Rhizopus, e.g., by fermentation in a medium that lacks a nitrogen source. An exemplary medium includes 100 g/L, MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.25 g/L, KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>0.60 g/L, and FeCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>0.05 g/L. Fermentation under conditions that inhibit fungal growth are favorable for lactic acid production because the available carbon source can be used for lactic acid production rather than for cell growth. Optionally, the growth-inhibiting medium can be temporarily replaced, periodically, with a growth-supporting medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Optionally, fermentation can be carried out using Rhizopus strains of the invention that are immobilized on a solid support. For example, the solid support for immobilization of the Rhizopus strains can be made of a synthetic polymer such as a polyolefin, in admixture with an organic polymeric plant material such as corn fibers, oat hulls, starch, and/or cellulose, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,893. Preferably, the synthetic polymer is present in an amount of about 50-95 wt % and the plant material is present in an amount of about 5-50 wt %. Examples of suitable polyolefins include polyethylene and polypropylene. The plant material may be a mixture that includes a plant material which functions as a nutrient to enhance growth of the Rhizopus strain on the support. The support may be produced by combining the synthetic polymer and plant material to form a composite, dough-like thermoplastic composition (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,893). By immobilizing the Rhizopus strain on a solid support, fermentation can be carried out in a continuous process. Alternatively, batch fermentation processes can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Lactic acid produced by the strains of the invention can be converted to a salt form thereof, i.e., L-lactate, or the free lactic acid can be isolated from the fermentation medium. To produce L-lactate, lactic acid is neutralized with a basic substance such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, or ammonium carbonate. Typically, the basic substance is included in the fermentation medium in an amount sufficient to neutralize the lactic acid produced during fermentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Conventional methods can be used to isolate the lactate salt. For example, calcium L-lactate can be precipitated from solution by lowering the temperature of the solution to about 4&deg; C., e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,486. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If desired, the isolated lactate salt then can be converted into lactic acid using conventional techniques. For example, a lactate salt solution can be applied to a cation exchange column to produce lactic acid, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,455. Alternatively, conventional electrodialysis methods can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, or in addition, to producing a lactate salt, free lactic acid can be isolated from the medium using conventional techniques. For example, free lactic acid can be isolated by contacting a lactic acid-rich medium with a solid-phase polymer that contains tertiary amine groups to adsorb the free lactic acid, e.g., as described, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,185. The tertiary amine functions of the adsorbent polymer can be provided by N-heterocyclic or by N-aliphatic groups, e.g., in their free base form. For example, AMBERLYST&trade; A-21 resin (Rohm and Haas; Philadelphia, Pa.) contains aliphatic tertiary amine functions and can be used to isolate free lactic acid. In other suitable polymers, the tertiary amine functions are pyridine functions, e.g., polyvinylpyridine polymers. For example, crosslinked polymers, such as REILLEX&trade; polymers, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Typically, the fermentation medium is filtered to remove the Rhizopus prior to contacting the polymer with the fermentation medium. The filtered fermentation medium containing lactic acid then is passed through a column containing the desired polymer, and the free lactic acid is bound to the column. After the polymer is saturated, the polymer preferably is washed with water, and the adsorbed lactic acid then is recovered using a desorbing agent. Examples of suitable desorbing agents include polar organic solvents (e.g., an alcohol such as methanol) or hot water. After the lactic acid is eluted from the column, the lactic acid can be treated in a conventional matter, e.g., concentrated by evaporation or distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> If desired, a Rhizopus strain of the invention can be transformed with a genetically engineered vector to express a coding sequence in the strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Conventional methods and vectors can be used. For example, the vector can be engineered such that it will become integrated into the genome of the Rhizopus strain. An exemplary method for transforming Rhizopus with a multicopy integration vector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,776.</paragraph>

A non-temperature-resistant <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>strain developed from <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>NRRL 395 was cultivated on PDA slants (Difco) at 30&deg; C. for about 7 days to produce spores. Approximately 6 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) solution was then added to each slant to wash off spores from mycelia on the agar surface. The spores were suspended in 3 mL TM-Triton buffer (Tris.HCl 6.0 g/L, maleic acid 5.8 g/L, (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>1.0 g/L, Ca(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>5 mg/L, MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.1 g/L, FeSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O 0.25 mg/L, Triton X-100 0.1%, adjusted to pH 6.0 using KOH). </paragraph>

After 30 minutes, 10 mL TM-Triton buffer was then added to the NTG-treated spore suspension. The treated spores were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with buffer.

The cultures were grown in 7.5 L air-lift fermentors at 34&deg; C. and 1.5 vvm air. The initial pH of the media was left as is, and the pH control point during incubation was 4.8. NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH was used for pH control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Sufficient cell mass, as determined by packed cell volume, was present after 16.5 hours of incubation, and a portion of the broths, amounting to 6% of the production media volume, was transferred to the production fermentor.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The fermentations were complete in 54 to 61.5 hours, at which point all of the dextrose had been consumed. The final titers (g/L), production rates (g/L/hr) and yields of calcium L-lactate are listed in Table 3. The production rates were calculated as: the total grams of lactic acid produced divided by the starting volume of the culture divided by the number of hours of fermentation. No precipitation of calcium L-lactate was observed in any of the cultures. As compared with the parental <highlight><italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic></highlight>strain, the strains of the invention produce lactic acid at an increased titer and rate.
