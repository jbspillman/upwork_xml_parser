<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a novel olefin polymerization catalyst and a process for olefin polymerization using the olefin polymerization catalyst. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polyolefins generally have excellent mechanical properties, so that they are used in many fields such as fields of various molded products. With the diversification of property requirements for the polyolefins, polyolefins of various properties have been desired in recent years, and besides increase of productivity of the polyolefins has been also desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As catalysts for producing polyolefins, titanium catalysts comprising a titanium compound and an organoaluminum compound and vanadium catalysts comprising a vanadium compound and an organoaluminum compound have been hitherto known. in addition, Ziegler catalysts comprising a metallocene compound such as zirconocene and an organoaluminum oxy-compound (aluminoxane) are known as catalysts capable of producing polyolefins with a high polymerization activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, a transition metal compound having a ligand of diimine structure has been proposed as a novel olefin polymerization catalyst (see International Patent Publication No. 9623010). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a novel olefin polymerization catalyst, further, a transition metal compound having a salicylaldoimine ligand has been recently proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. 132706/1998. This catalyst exhibits high olefin polymerization activity at a temperature of about 25&deg; C. In the production of polyolefins using an industrial process, however, a polymerization catalyst exhibiting higher polymerization activity at high temperatures is desired because higher temperatures are advantageous in that the reaction heat can be easily removed and the viscosity of the reaction solution can be lowered to thereby enhance productivity. </paragraph>

It is another object of the invention to provide a process for olefin polymerization using the catalyst having such excellent properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The olefin polymerization catalyst according to the present invention comprises a transition metal compound which is represented by the following formula (I) and in which the net charge parameter of the central metal M is not more than 2.00:

<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> Into a 300 ml reactor thoroughly dried and purged with nitrogen, 34.04 g (200.0 mmol) of 4-phenylphenol, 3.40 g of Umberist-15E (trade name, available from Organo Co.) and 150 ml of toluene were introduced. To the reactor, a solution containing 48.20 g (200.0 mmol) of t-butyl alcohol diluted with 10 ml of a toluene was dropwise added at 105&deg; C., followed by stirring for 16 hours. After the system was cooled to room temperature, the solution was introduced into 500 ml of hexane and filtered with washing with hexane. After concentration, the resulting liquid was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain 31.15 g (yield: 69%) of 2-t-butyl-4-phenylphenol. </paragraph>

To the reactor, a solution containing 43.16 g (190.7 mmol) of 2-t-butyl-4-phenylphenol diluted with 90 ml of a THF was dropwise added at 0&deg; C. over a period of 40 minutes, then the temperature of the system was slowly raised to room temperature, and the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, 700 ml of toluene was added, and the system was heated to 100&deg; C. to distill off 52 ml of a mixed solution of ether and THF, whereby an opaque white slurry was obtained. After the slurry was cooled to &minus;20&deg; C., 13.84 g (460.9 mmol) of paraformaldehyde and 38.1 ml (273.4 mmol) of triethylamine were added, followed by stirring at 90&deg; C. for 30 minutes. After ice cooling, the reaction solution was quenched with 133 ml of 18% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was washed with 300 ml of water, </paragraph>

To the reactor, 1.97 ml of a n-hexane solution containing 3.15 mmol of n-butyllithium was slowly dropwise added, then the temperature of the system was slowly raised to room temperature, and the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours to prepare a lithium salt solution. The solution was dropwise added to 30 ml of a THF solution containing 0.57 g (1.50 mmol) of a ZrCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(THF)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>complex, said THF solution having been cooled to &minus;78&deg; C. After the dropwise addition was completed, stirring was continued with slowly raising the temperature to room temperature. Then, stirring was further performed at room temperature for 20 hours, and the solvent was distilled off from the reaction solution. To the resulting solid, 20 ml of ether was added to give a slurry, and the slurry was filtered with washing with 10 ml of methylene chloride. The filtrate was concentrated and washed again with 30 ml of ether to obtain 0.49 g (yield: 39%) of a compound (22) represented by the following formula (22) as a yellow powder. </paragraph>
