<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the authentication of an item, such as a banknote, a certificate or a mailpiece and, in particular, to authenticate the item by validating a security marking provided thereon. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is generally known to employ automated detectors which are responsive to images with high reflective contrast in the visible region of the spectrum for the machine processing of various types of information-bearing tickets, tags, labels, postage indicia and similar security markings. It is further known to employ automated detectors that are responsive to fluorescent emissions of security markings resulting from excitation at a shorter wavelength such as ultraviolet (UV) excitation. For example, in the postage meter art, mail pieces carrying postage indicia printed with fluorescent ink enhance the machine processing of the mail. In the United States and Canada, automatic equipment correctly faces or orients individual mail pieces by detecting red-fluorescence of postal indicia attached to mail pieces. Postal Service facing equipment employs a simple detector to locate the fluorescence. This detector does not verify that the fluorescence and the indicium image are physically coincident, thus limiting the ability of the detector to verify the authenticity of the security marking. As used herein, the term red-fluorescence refers not to the visible color of the ink but to fluorescence in the red region of the spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Fluorescent security marking&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to a security marking that fluoresces in a defined region of the spectrum upon exposure to a shorter wavelength excitation light such as UV light. The shift in wavelength between the incident excitation light and the fluorescent emission clearly distinguishes fluorescence from direct reflection. Fluorescent security markings are effectively applied to the detection of forged tickets, securities, identification cards, security papers, and the like. The difficulty of copying the fluorescence of security markings deters copying and provides forensic evidence of counterfeits. Among the applications of these security markings are the detection of articles, production marking, and automatic article identification. Intensity of the fluorescence is important to the success of these applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A counterfeiter without access to a printer with machine-readable fluorescent ink can produce a security mark that fluoresces and is machine-readable by printing the copied indicium over a fluorescent background, or by applying a fluorescent material over the copied indicium. In either case, the original and copied indicia are distinguishable. A forensic verifier system will make this distinction as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A manual forensic detection system can be simply a visible light source and an ultraviolet source with a switch that can switch between the two sources. An operator can view the indicium under the two light sources and verify the fluorescence of the image and the non-fluorescence of the background under ultraviolet illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When an original security marking is illuminated with visible light, the image is dark against the bright background of the paper. When the original security marking image is illuminated with the ultraviolet light source, the image is bright against the low fluorescence background of the paper. Similarly, a copied security marking illuminated with visible light appears dark against a light background. Contrary to the properties of an image of an original security marking under ultraviolet illumination, a copied security marking printed on a fluorescent background or overprinted with fluorescent material and illuminated with ultraviolet light will show a dark image against the bright fluorescent background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Rotary and other letterpress postage meters imprint the indicium on an envelope with a platen using an ink impregnated into a foam or other porous media. Red-fluorescent colored inks for letterpress meters include red, blue, green and black inks. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,681,317; 2,763,785; 3,230,221; 3,560,238; 3,928,226 and 4,015,131 disclose red-fluorescent inks for this purpose. These inks, in general, have a non-aqueous solvent-based vehicle system with a low vapor pressure, and have a high solid concentration, high viscosity, high boiling temperature and low surface tension. Letterpress technology lacks the ability of digital printing to print variable information. These letterpress inks therefore cannot be used in inkjet printers, which require stable solutions or stable dispersions with small particles, low viscosity and a specified surface tension. The viscosity of the liquid inks can vary from about 1.5 to 15 centipoise (cps) in current piezoelectric inkjet printers and from about 1 to 5 cps in thermal inkjet printers. The desirable surface tension of inkjet printer inks is between 30 to 50 dynes/cm. Examples of such red-colored, aqueous red-fluorescent inks are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,381. The disclosed inks fulfill USPS requirements for franking while being compatible with use in an inkjet printer. These inks are stable for extended periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The formulations of these inks are based on water, co-solvent and penetrant solutions of water-soluble fluorescent toners. These inks are designed to achieve the required fluorescence intensity by limiting optical absorption, resulting in an optical density lower than that normally required for machine readability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Postage indicia and franking machines have been developed to make use of digital printing and especially inkjet printing. An example is the Personal Post&trade; Postage Meter, which is manufactured by Pitney Bowes Inc. of Stamford, Conn. It is known in the art to print red colored, red-fluorescent indicia with variable data using digital printers. Digitally printed indicia provide significant advantages over letterpress indicia. Inkjet printing provides a means of printing indicia with high-density variable information. Pitney Bowes&apos; PostPerfect meter produces a red-colored, red-fluorescent indicium with variable data by thermal transfer printing, while Personal Post Office produces red-colored, red-fluorescent indicia by inkjet printing. The USPS IBIP program allows the use of a black, machine-readable indicia. The Post Office equipment typically orients mail pieces bearing IBIP indicia using a facing identification mark or by a fluorescent tag added to the indicium. Postal services employ the machine-readable variable information for value added services, for cryptographic authentication of the indicium and for obtaining marketing information. Compared to letterpress technology, digital printers can provide print quality and contrast that does not decrease with the number of prints. The images can be printed at high resolution, high quality and at high speeds by direct, non-impact print engines. These inks have additional advantages for security markings since they may include penetrating solvents that cause the selective penetration of fluorescent component into the paper. This selective penetration provides rubbing and scratch resistance to the fluorescent component of the security markings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another problem is that the use of inkjet printing for postage franking is presently restricted, to some extent, by the lack of inks functional with inkjet technology that are simultaneously suitable for franking and machine-readability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Postal services employ the information printed in the indicium for security and marketing purposes, as well as for processing the mail. In particular, the Information-Based Indicia Program (IBIP) of the USPS contains high-density, variable, cryptographically protected information in a two-dimensional bar code. To capture this information, postal scanning equipment must efficiently detect and read the information-based indicium. Postal indicia printed on various substrates have to display sufficient contrast in reflection to enable machine-readability. For example on dark substrates, such as Kraft envelopes with reflectance between 0.45 and 0.6, it is very difficult to achieve the desired contrast with red inks. Therefore, there is a strong need for printing security markings which exhibit high contrast, preferably black, and simultaneously red-fluorescence. However, red-fluorescent inks usually do not have enough contrast to be reliably read by optical character recognition (OCR) equipment, bar code readers and other types of machine vision technology. These systems often have illumination and detection systems in the red region of the spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A drawback of fluorescent security features is that there are a large variety of commercially available organic luminescent compounds. Common examples are the optical brighteners and commercially available colored-fluorescent materials and inks. Fraudulent replication of indicia would only demand substitution of the authentic material with a luminescent substance that emits light of a similar color. Thus, it is advantageous to provide luminescent inks with unique optical properties that cannot be simulated with materials that are easily available. The present invention provides inks with such unique optical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the mailpiece security system based on digital indicia, if the postage indicium is duplicated and produced on more than one mailpiece, it is very difficult for the Postal Service to tell which, among the mailpieces having identical indicium, has the original indicium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is advantageous and desirable to provide a method and a system to provide added security to the mailpiece, which can then be used to distinguish between mailpiece(s) that are legitimately paid for and those that are not. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention to authenticate an item, such as a mailpiece, using a security marking, which is difficult to duplicate. The security marking can be a postage stamp or indicium or other printed image. This object can be achieved by providing the security marking using an ink capable of absorbing visible light and producing a fluorescent emission under ultraviolet excitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An ink property which is not commonly available is the simultaneous presence of a dark color (preferably black) visually different than the color of fluorescence and fluorescence. This property belongs to the non-iridescent, photosensitive Optically Variable Device (OVD) category, which is difficult to counterfeit. The OVD categorization results from a normal black appearance when illuminated with visible light, but red-fluorescence under UV light. This difference is predictable, reversible and reproducible under well-defined conditions. The subject invention provides an ink which fluoresces in red and also has high optical density throughout the visible spectrum so that it can be read by a human operator or by a machine vision system. The high contrast provided by the dark color allows commercial scanners to image documents or indicia printed with this ink, even on dark colored envelopes such as Kraft envelopes. The absorption at all wavelengths makes the required contrast achievable under a red filter and red illumination on ubiquitous Kraft, brown envelopes. Such OVD properties can be integrated into the document because of their normal black appearance. Therefore the OVD are covert security markings, looking indistinguishable from ubiquitous black prints but hiding the fluorescent features. Control of the manufacture and supply of these Photosensitive Optically Variable inks provide a significant barrier to undetectable copying. </paragraph>

In order to determine whether the postage stamp or indicium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a valid one or an illegally produced duplicate, it is preferred that the postage stamp or indicium be printed with a special ink. In particular, the ink is capable of absorbing visible light and producing a fluorescent emission upon ultraviolet excitation. Two examples of the special ink are listed in Table I and Table II below. Because the ink is capable of absorbing visible light, it produces a visible image that can be acquired in a Post Office using an image scanner that is currently used to acquire the image of an indicium made in a regular ink. Furthermore, the USPS also uses franking machines that can detect red fluorescence. Thus, an indicium printed with an ink that includes OVD properties (referred to herein as an OVD ink) can be processed by the USPS without modification of currently available equipment. Postage indicia and franking machines have been developed to make use of digital printing and especially inkjet printing. Thus, preferably, the OVD ink can be used on digital printers including inkjet printers. </paragraph>

For example, the security marking can be provided on the non-mail item <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as one or more alphanumeric symbols <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a graphic design <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the likeness of an object <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, or a barcode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The security marking on the non-mailed item <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be verified by comparing the visible image and the fluorescent image produced from the security marking in a similar way to the security marking on a mailpiece. The term Photosensitive Optically Variable (POV) security marking as used herein refers to a printed visually black or dark gray machine-readable information-bearing marking that fluoresces in a specific wavelength range when excited with a shorter wavelength light. The POV security marking exhibits visual light absorption throughout the entire visual spectrum including the red region of the visible spectrum where red inks are invisible to typical automatic scanning systems. These inks will achieve acceptable PCS (Print Contrast Signal) on dark papers such as Kraft or Manila. </paragraph>

The image scanned in reflection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> was obtained by illuminating the marking with visible light. The low reflectance of the black ink results in dark areas of the scanned image corresponding to printed areas of the security marking. The image scanned in fluorescence <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is obtained by viewing the visible red-fluorescent emissions under ultraviolet (UV) illumination. The scanned image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shows that the security marking emits visible light when illuminated with UV light resulting in light areas in the scanned image corresponding to the printed areas. Comparison of images <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shows that the fluorescing image is a negative of the reflective image, i.e., there is a strong negative correlation between the two images. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Forensic characteristics are important to value metering applications such as postal payment and to other security applications. Other security applications of fluorescent inks include security papers and documents. Thus even after the removal of the visible dark color the remaining fluorescent image <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will provide forensic evidence of what was printed. In the present invention, the difference in penetration between the fluorescent and non-fluorescent components provides forensic evidence of the presence of the marking after the visible components have been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A security marking printed with a general purpose black ink is easily copied or modified. Verification of the authenticity of the data such as by verifying a cryptographic digital signature included in the bar code data can detect data modification, but not copying. The machine-readable fluorescent ink disclosed herein provides a barrier against undetectable copying. Frequently, fluorescence is added to colored inks to increase the brightness. There is no general commercial incentive to produce visually dark fluorescent inks for graphics purposes, so the machine-readable fluorescent ink can be a unique controlled supply item for the specific intended purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> These POV security markings may be produced by digital printing., thermal transfer or electrophotography. In particular, the markings may be produced with the water-based inks disclosed herein through ink jet printing. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> visible light source <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used to provide illuminating light <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With the reflected light <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from the security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a reflected image scanner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can acquire the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Similarly, an ultraviolet light source <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is used to provide illuminating light <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With the fluorescent emission <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from the security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the fluorescent image scanner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can acquire the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a controlling mechanism <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is used to coordinate the illumination by the illuminating sources <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the image acquisition by the image scanners <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The reflected image scanner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent image scanner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can acquire the respective images separately and sequentially. However, it is also possible to acquire the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> simultaneously when appropriate filters and optical components are used to direct the reflected light <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the fluorescent emission <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the respective image scanners. It is preferred that the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are stored in an image storage means <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, so that they can be processed and compared. As shown, a signal or image data <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> indicative of the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a signal or image data <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> indicative of the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are conveyed to an image processing and correlation device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Because the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; image of the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and these two images are in different colors, it is preferable to process the image data <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> before comparing the image data <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. For example, a software program <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can be used to compute a value <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> indicative of the correlation between the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The correlation value <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> can then be compared to a predetermined value <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for determining whether the fluorescent image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the visible image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are the results of the OVD ink used to print the security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The security marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be assumed to be legally produced using the OVD ink only if the correlation value <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is equal or greater than the predetermined value <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, for example. It should be noted that, because the fluorescent emission from the OVD ink can be limited to a certain wavelength range, it is possible to use a bandpass filter to allow only the fluorescent emission <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in that wavelength range to reach the fluorescent image scanner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As such, the fluorescent emission from an illegal duplicate can be filtered out. It should be noted that the above description, taken in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is concerned with the fluorescent image and the visible image obtained from a postage stamp or indicium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the fluorescent image and the visible image can be obtained from any security marking. Furthermore, while it is preferred to use an image scanner to obtain an image from the security marking, it is possible to use a digital camera or a video camera to obtain the image. It is also possible to use a film camera to obtain the image and a converting means to convert the film image to a digital image for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an overall system for the authentication of an item using a security marking made from an OVD ink. For example, the system can be incorporated into an existing postage authentication system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a postage meter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a print head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for printing a postage indicium and other mail or non-mail related information or images on the mailpiece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Instead of the postage meter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a printer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be connected to a personal computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to print the information or images. When the mailpiece is received by a data center <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, an encryption information verification system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be used to validate the postage indicium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the encrypted information contained therein. Additionally, a security marking verification system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be used to verify a security marking from the fluorescent image and the visible image obtained therefrom. Preferably, the print head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is an inkjet print head and the printer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is an inkjet printer so that they can use the OVD inks as shown in Table I and Table II to print a security marking.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Table II shows a heterogeneous, water-based OVD ink composition that absorbs visible light and produces a fluorescent emission under ultraviolet excitation. Basically, the ink composition comprises a blue colorant, a water-soluble organic solvent, fluorescent pigment dispersion and water. The Lumikol dispersions were obtained from United Mineral &amp; Chemical Corp. of Lynhurst, N.J., a distributor for Nippon Keiko Kagaku of Japan. The Hostafine Blue B2G (blue pigment) is manufactured by Clariant Inc. of Coventry, R.I. The heterogeneous ink in Table II produces an image on white envelopes with a fluorescence intensity of 37 PMU. The optical density of the image is 0.86 and the PCR is 64% with white illumination and 85% with red illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink absorbs visible light in the wavelength range substantially between 390 nanometers and 680 nanometers and the ink appears black, dark gray or dark blue. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graph of reflectance as a function of wavelength. The reflectance of white paper <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is high over the whole wavelength range. The reflectance of red postage meter ink <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is low up to about 550 nanometers and then makes a transition to highly reflective above 600 nanometers. An image scanner that is sensitive only in the red region of the spectrum will see very little contrast between the reflectance of the paper <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the reflectance of the red ink <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The homogeneous ink composition shown in Table I produces an image with reflectance <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> that absorbs over the preferred wavelength range substantially between 390 and 680 nanometers. The heterogeneous ink composition shown in Table II produces an image with reflectance <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> that shows good contrast with the paper up to 750 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink produces a fluorescent emission with a peak at a wavelength longer than 580 nanometers and the ink appears red or dark orange when excited by ultraviolet radiation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph of fluorescent emission of regions of an image under ultraviolet illumination. The fluorescent intensity <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of white paper is typically concentrated below 500 nanometers.

The fluorescent intensity <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> of the homogeneous OVD ink and the fluorescent intensity <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of the heterogeneous OVD ink have peaks centered above 580 nanometers with sufficient intensity to be detected by postal facing equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the item to be authenticated has one or more security markings thereon, wherein the security markings are printed with an ink capable of absorbing light in the visible wavelength range to appear visibly black and producing a red-fluorescent emission under ultraviolet excitation. It should be noted that, the security markings can be produced with any medium that is capable of absorbing light in the visible wavelength range to appear visibly black and producing a fluorescent emission under any shorter wavelength excitation. For example, the medium can be a coating. It can be an analog ink, such as the ink for offset printing, manual stamping, silkscreen and flexography. The medium can also be that for digital printing using thermal transfer technology, electrophotography and inkjet printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention is not limited to producing a red-fluorescent emission under ultraviolet excitation.
