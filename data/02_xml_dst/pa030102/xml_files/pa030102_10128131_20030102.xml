<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic and research procedure that uses high magnetic fields and radio-frequency signals to produce images. The most abundant molecular species in biological tissues is water. It is the quantum mechanical &ldquo;spin&rdquo; of the water proton nuclei that ultimately gives rise to the signal in all imaging experiments. In MRI the sample to be imaged is placed in a strong static magnetic field (1-12 Tesla) and the spins are excited with a pulse of radio frequency (RF) radiation to produce a net magnetization in the sample. Various magnetic field gradients and other RF pulses then act on the spins to code spatial information into the recorded signals. MRI is able to generate structural information in three dimensions in relatively short time spans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> MR images are typically displayed on a gray scale with black the lowest and white the highest measured intensity (I). This measured intensity I&equals;C*M, where C is the concentration of spins (in this case, water concentration) and M is a measure of the magnetization present at time of the measurement. Although variations in water concentration (C) can give rise to contrast in MR images, it is the strong dependence of the rate of change of M on local environment that is the source of image intensity variation in MRI. Two characteristic relaxation times, T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>&amp; T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, govern the rate at which the magnetization can be accurately measured. T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the exponential time constant for the spins to decay back to equilibrium after being perturbed by the RF pulse. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) a typical MR imaging scan (RF &amp; gradient pulse sequence and data acquisition) is repeated at a constant rate for a predetermined number of times and the data averaged. The signal amplitude recorded for any given scan is proportional to the number of spins that have decayed back to equilibrium since the previous scan. Thus, regions with rapidly decaying spins (i.e. short T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>values) will recover all of their signal amplitude between successive scans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The measured intensities in the final image will accurately reflect the spin density (i.e. water content). Regions with long T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>values compared to the time between scans will progressively lose signal until a steady state condition is reached and will appear as darker regions in the final image. Changes in T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(spin-spin relaxation time) result in changes in the signal linewidth (shorter T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>values) yielding larger linewidths. In extreme situations the linewidth can be so large that the signal is indistinguishable from background noise. In clinical imaging, water relaxation characteristics vary from tissue to tissue, providing the contrast which allows the discrimination of tissue types. Moreover, the MRI experiment can be setup so that regions of the sample with short T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>values and/or long T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>values are preferentially enhanced so called T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-weighted and T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-weighted imaging protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> MRI Contrast Agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a rapidly growing body of literature demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of paramagnetic contrast agents (currently 8 are in clinical trials or in use). The capacity to differentiate regions/tissues that may be magnetically similar but histologically distinct is a major impetus for the preparation of these agents. In the design of MRI contrast agents, strict attention must be given to a variety of properties that will ultimately effect the physiological outcome apart from the ability to provide contrast enhancement. Two fundamental properties that must be considered are biocompatability and proton relaxation enhancement. Biocompatability is influenced by several factors including toxicity, stability (thermodynamic and kinetic), pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Proton relaxation enhancement (or relaxivity) is chiefly governed by the choice of metal and rotational correlation times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The first feature to be considered during the design stage is the selection of the metal atom, which will dominate the measured relaxivity of the complex. Paramagnetic metal ions, as a result of their unpaired electrons, act as potent relaxation enhancement agents. They decrease the T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>relaxation times of nearby (r<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>dependence) spins. Some paramagnetic ions decrease the T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>without causing substantial linebroadening (e.g. gadolinium (III), (Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>)), while others induce drastic linebroadening (e.g. superparamagnetic iron oxide). The mechanism of T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>relaxation is generally a through space dipole-dipole interaction between the unpaired electrons of the paramagnet (the metal atom with an unpaired electron) and bulk water molecules (water molecules that are not &ldquo;bound&rdquo; to the metal atom) that are in fast exchange with water molecules in the metal&apos;s inner coordination sphere (are bound to the metal atom). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, regions associated with a Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> ion (near-by water molecules) appear bright in an MR image where the normal aqueous solution appears as dark background if the time between successive scans in the experiment is short (i.e. T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>weighted image). Localized T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>shortening caused by superparamagnetic particles is believed to be due to the local magnetic field inhomogeneities associated with the large magnetic moments of these particles. Regions associated with a superparamagnetic iron oxide particle appear dark in an MR image where the normal aqueous solution appears as high intensity background if the echo time (TE) in the spin-echo pulse sequence experiment is long (i.e. T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-weighted image). The lanthanide atom Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> is by the far the most frequently chosen metal atom for MRI contrast agents because it has a very high magnetic moment (u<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;63BM<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and a symmetric electronic ground state (S<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>). Transition metals such as high spin Mn(II) and Fe(III) are also candidates due to their high magnetic moments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Once the appropriate metal has been selected, a suitable ligand or chelate must be found to render the complex nontoxic. The term chelator is derived from the Greek word chele which means a &ldquo;crabs claw&rdquo;, an appropriate description for a material that uses its many &ldquo;arms&rdquo; to grab and hold on to a metal atom (see DTPA below). Several factors influence the stability of chelate complexes include enthalpy and entropy effects (e.g. number, charge and basicity of coordinating groups, ligand field and conformational effects). Various molecular design features of the ligand can be directly correlated with physiological results. For example, the presence of a single methyl group on a given ligand structure can have a pronounced effect on clearance rate. While the addition of a bromine group can force a given complex from a purely extracellular role to an effective agent that collects in hepatocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (DTPA) chelates and thus acts to detoxify lanthanide ions. The stability constant (K) for Gd(DTPA) <highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight> is very high (logK&equals;22.4) and is more commonly known as the formation constant (the higher the logK, the more stable the complex). This thermodynamic parameter indicates the fraction of Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions that are in the unbound state will be quite small and should not be confused with the rate (kinetic stability) at which the loss of metal occurs (k<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>/k<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>). The water soluble Gd(DTPA)<highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight> chelate is stable, nontoxic, and one of the most widely used contrast enhancement agents in experimental and clinical imaging research. It was approved for clinical use in adult patients in June of 1988. It is an extracellular agent that accumulates in tissue by perfusion dominated processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To date, a number of chelators have been used, including diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (DTPA), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane&prime;-N,N&prime;N&Prime;,N&prime;&Prime;-tetracetic acid (DOTA), and derivatives thereof. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,215, 5,087,440, 5,219,553, 5,188,816, 4,885,363, 5,358,704, 5,262,532, and Meyer et al., Invest. Radiol. 25: S53 (1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Image enhancement improvements using Gd(DTPA) are well documented in a number of applications (Runge et al., Magn, Reson. Imag. 3:85 (1991); Russell et al., AJR 152:813 (1989); Meyer et al., Invest. Radiol. 25:S53 (1990)) including visualizing blood-brain barrier disruptions caused by space occupying lesions and detection of abnormal vascularity. It has recently been applied to the functional mapping of the human visual cortex by defining regional cerebral hemodynamics (Belliveau et al., (1991) 254:719). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another chelator used in Gd contrast agents is the macrocyclic ligand 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N&prime;,N&Prime;N&prime;&Prime;-tetracetic acid (DOTA). The Gd-DOTA complex has been thoroughly studied in laboratory tests involving animals and humans. The complex is conformationally rigid, has an extremely high formation constant (logk&equals;28.5), and at physiological pH possess very slow dissociation kinetics. Recently, the GdDOTA complex was approved as an MRI set off agent for use in adults and infants in France and has been administered to over 4500 patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, another class of chelators has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,901, 5,892,029, WO 97/00245, and Cohen et al., lnorg. Chem. 39:5747 (2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, previous work has resulted in MRI contrast agents that report on physiologic or metabolic processes within a biological or other type of sample. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,605, U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,862, PCT US96/08549, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/134,072, MRI contrast agents have been constructed that allow an increase in contrast as a result of the interaction of a blocking moiety present on the agent with a target substance. That is, in the presence of the target substance, the exchange of water in one or more inner sphere coordination sites of the contrast agent is increased, leading to a brighter signal; in the absence of the target substance, the exchange of water is hindered and the image remains dark. Thus, the previous work enables imaging of physiological events rather than just structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As noted above, these MRI contrast agents have a variety of uses. However, a limitation of currently approved MRI contrast agents is their vascular or in vivo residence time. A further limitation is the ability to deliver therapeutic agents and follow the therapeutic agents via MRI after their delivery. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide imaging moieties, comprising a plurality of MRI contrast agents, that have increased in vivo residence time and allow the detection of physiological substances and delivery and detection of therapeutic agents within an animal, tissue or cell. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast moieties having increased in vivo residence time and amplified MRI signal. The imaging moieties comprise a polymer and a plurality of activatable MRI contrast agents each linked to the polymer by a cleavable linkage (see, e.g., FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). In the absence of a physiological target substance, the MRI contrast agents of the invention are relatively inactive, or have weak relaxivity, as contrast enhancement agents. However, in the presence of the physiological or target substance, the MRI contrast agents of the invention are activated and, thereby, alter the MR image. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,605 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,862, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/866,512, each expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the image moieties of the present invention is their increased in vivo residence time and amplified MRI signal. The imaging moieties comprise a polymer and a plurality of MRI contrast agents each linked to the polymer by a cleavable linkage. The cleavable linkage is cleaved in the presence of a physiological or target substance. Thus, the MRI contrast agents can be slowly removed or cleaved from the polymer backbone. The cleavable linkage includes any number of cleavage linkages or sites as outlined herein, including protease cleavage sites as well as ester linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The imaging moieties can also detect the delivery of therapeutically active agents (e.g., drugs) as a result of an interaction of a physiological target agent and the MRI contrast agents of the imaging moieties. The MRI contrast agents of the invention are relatively inactive, or have weak relaxivity, as contrast enhancement agents in the absence of the physiological target substance, and are activated, thus altering the MR image, upon the delivery of the therapeutically active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The imaging of the delivery of the target physiological substance can occur in two basic ways. In one embodiment, it is the actual interaction of the blocking moiety with its target that causes the MRI contrast agent to turn &ldquo;on&rdquo;, as described below; that is, as a result of the presence of the physiological target, the MRI contrast agent undergoes a reorganization that can include the cleavage of the blocking moiety off the remainder of MRI contrast agent, causing an increase in signal as a result of an increase in the exchange of water in an inner coordination site. Alternatively, it is the delivery event of the blocking moiety that is imaged; that is, the blocking moiety is cleaved off of the MRI contrast agent as a result of exposure to a cleavage agent such as a protease, freeing the blocking moiety to interact with its target. In general, it is the former that is discussed herein, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, either possibility can occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Viewed simplistically, this &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; mechanism, whereby the contrast agent is &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; (i.e. increases the relaxivity) is based on a dynamic equilibrium that affects the rate of exchange of water molecules in one or more coordination sites of a paramagnetic metal ion contained in the MRI contrast agents of the imaging moieties of the present invention. In turn, the rate of exchange of the water molecule is determined by the presence or absence of the therapeutic blocking moiety on the MRI contrast agent. Thus, for example, in the presence of the therapeutically active agent, the metal ion complexes of the invention which chelate the paramagnetic ion have reduced coordination sites available which can rapidly exchange with the water molecules of the local environment. Also, for example, in the absence of the target substance, the metal ion complexes of the invention which chelate the paramagnetic ion have reduced coordination sites available which can rapidly exchange with the water molecules of the local environment. In such a situation, the water coordination sites are substantially occupied or blocked by the coordination atoms of the chelator and at least one therapeutic blocking moiety. Thus, the paramagnetic ion has essentially no water molecules in its &ldquo;inner-coordination sphere&rdquo;, i.e., actually bound to the metal when the target substance is absent. It is the interaction of the paramagnetic metal ion with the protons on the inner coordination sphere water molecules and the rapid exchange of such water molecules that cause the high observed relaxivity, and thus the imaging effect, of the paramagnetic metal ion. Accordingly, if all the coordination sites of the metal ion in the metal ion complex are occupied with moieties other than water molecules, for example, when the therapeutic blocking moiety is present, there is little if any net enhancement of the imaging signal by the metal ion complexes of the invention. However, when the therapeutically active agent is removed (for example, either as a result of an interaction with its physiological target or by cleavage), this effectively frees at least one of the inner-sphere coordination sites on the metal ion complex. The water molecules of the local environment are then available to reversibly occupy the inner-sphere coordination site or sites, which will cause an increase in the rate of exchange of water and relaxivity of the metal ion complex toward water thereby producing image enhancement which is a measure of the delivery of the therapeutically active agent or measure of the presence of the target substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that even in the absence of the target substance, at any particular coordination site, there will be a dynamic equilibrium for one or more coordination sites as between a coordination atom of the blocking moiety and water molecules. That is, even when a coordination atom is tightly bound to the metal, there will be some exchange of water molecules at the site. However, in most instances, this exchange of water molecules is neither rapid nor significant, and does not result in significant image enhancement. However, upon exposure to the target substance, the blocking moiety dislodges from the coordination site and the exchange of water is increased, i.e. rapid exchange and therefore an increase in relaxivity may occur, with significant image enhancement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Generally, a 2 to 5% change in the MRI signal used to generate the image is sufficient to be detectable. Thus, it is preferred that the agents of the invention in the presence of a target substance increase the MRI signal by at least 2 to 5% as compared to the signal gain the absence of the target substance. Signal enhancement of 2 to 90% is preferred, and 10 to 50% is more preferred for each coordination site made available by the target substance interaction with the blocking moiety. That is, when the blocking moiety occupies two or more coordination sites, the release of the blocking moiety can result in double the increase in signal or more as compared to a single coordination site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition, the compounds of the invention may also utilize targeting moieties attached to these activatable MRI contrast agents. By utilizing a targeting moiety, defined below, that can direct the MRI contrast agent to a particular cell type, tissue, or location, the MRI contrast agents of the invention become more effective, discriminatory and selective. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention comprise a chelator and a blocking moiety. See for example U.S. Ser. No. 10/116,706, U.S. Ser. No. 09/866,512; U.S. Ser. No. 09/972,302; U.S. Ser. No. 09/908,436, U.S. Ser. No. 09/715,859, PCT application Ser. No. PCT/US01114665, and U.S. patent application entitled &ldquo;Novel Macrocyclic Activatible Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agents,&rdquo; by inventor Thomas J. Meade, filed Apr. 22, 2002, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the MRI contrast agents of the invention comprise a metal ion complex. The metal ion complexes of the invention comprise a paramagnetic metal ion bound to a complex comprising a chelator and a blocking moiety. By &ldquo;paramagnetic metal ion&rdquo;, &ldquo;paramagnetic ion&rdquo; or &ldquo;metal ion&rdquo; herein is meant a metal ion which is magnetized parallel or antiparallel to a magnetic field to an extent proportional to the field. Generally, these are metal ions which have unpaired electrons; this is a term understood in the art. Examples of suitable paramagnetic metal ions, include, but are not limited to, gadolinium III (Gd&plus;3 or Gd(III)), iron III (Fe&plus;3 or Fe(III)), manganese II (Mn&plus;2 or Mn(II)), yttrium III (Yt&plus;3 or Yt(III)), dysprosium (Dy&plus;3 or Dy(III)), and chromium (Cr(III) or Cr&plus;3). In a preferred embodiment the paramagnetic ion is the lanthanide atom Gd(III), due to its high magnetic moment (u<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;63BM2), a symmetric electronic ground state (S8), and its current approval for diagnostic use in humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition to the metal ion, the metal ion complexes of the invention comprise a chelator and a blocking moiety which may be covalently attached to the chelator. Due to the relatively high toxicity of many of the paramagnetic ions, the ions are rendered nontoxic in physiological systems by binding to a suitable chelator. Thus, the substitution of blocking moieties in coordination sites of the chelator, which in the presence of the target substance are capable of vacating the coordination sites in favor of water molecules, may render the metal ion complex more toxic by decreasing the half-life of dissociation for the metal ion complex. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, only a single coordination site is occupied or blocked by a blocking moiety. However, for some applications, e.g. analysis of tissue and the like, the toxicity of the metal ion complexes may not be of paramount importance. Similarly, some metal ion complexes are so stable that even the replacement of one or more additional coordination atoms with a blocking moiety does not significantly effect the half-life of dissociation. For example, DOTA, described below, when complexed with Gd(III) is extremely stable. Accordingly, when DOTA serves as the chelator, several of the coordination atoms of the chelator may be replaced with blocking moieties without a significant increase in toxicity. Additionally such an agent would potentially produce a larger signal since it has two or more coordination sites which are rapidly exchanging water with the bulk solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of factors which influence the choice and stability of the chelate metal ion complex, including enthalpy and entropy effects (e.g. number, charge and basicity of coordinating groups, ligand field and conformational effects). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In general, the chelator has a number of coordination sites containing coordination atoms which bind the metal ion. The number of coordination sites, and thus the structure of the chelator, depends on the metal ion. The chelators used in the metal ion complexes of the present invention preferably have at least one less coordination atom (n-1) than the metal ion is capable of binding (n), since at least one coordination site of the metal ion complex is occupied or blocked by a blocking moiety, as described below, to confer functionality on the metal ion complex. Thus, for example, Gd(III) may have 8 strongly associated coordination atoms or ligands and is capable of weakly binding a ninth ligand. Accordingly, suitable chelators for Gd(III) will have less than 9 coordination atoms. In a preferred embodiment, a Gd(III) chelator will have 8 coordination atoms, with a blocking moiety either occupying or blocking the remaining site in the metal ion complex. In an alternative embodiment, the chelators used in the metal ion complexes of the invention have two less coordination atoms (n-2) than the metal ion is capable of binding (n), with these coordination sites occupied by one or more blocking moieties. Thus, alternative embodiments utilize Gd(III) chelators with at least 5 coordination atoms, with at least 6 coordination atoms being preferred, at least 7 being particularly preferred, and at least 8 being especially preferred, with the blocking moiety either occupying or blocking the remaining sites. It should be appreciated that the exact structure of the chelator and blocking moiety may be difficult to determine, and thus the exact number of coordination atoms may be unclear. For example, it is possible that the chelator provide a fractional or non-integer number of coordination atoms; i.e. the chelator may provide 7.5 coordination atoms, i.e., the 8th coordination atom is on average not fully bound to the metal ion. However, the metal ion complex may still be functional, if the 8th coordination atom is sufficiently bound to prevent the rapid exchange of water at the site, and/or the blocking moiety impedes the rapid exchange of water at the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> There are a large number of known macrocyclic chelators or ligands which are used to chelate lanthanide and paramagnetic ions. See for example, Alexander, Chem. Rev. 95:273-342 (1995) and Jackels, Pharm. Med. imag, Section III, Chap. 20, p645 (1990), expressly incorporated herein by reference, which describes a large number of macrocyclic chelators and their synthesis. Similarly, there are a number of patents which describe suitable chelators for use in the invention, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,215, 5,087,440, 5,219,553, 5,188,816, 4,885,363, 5,358,704, 5,262,532, and Meyer et al., Invest. Radiol. 25: S53 (1990), all of which are also expressly incorporated by reference. Thus, as will be understood by those in the art, any of the known paramagnetic metal ion chelators or lanthanide chelators can be easily modified using the teachings herein to further comprise at least one blocking moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a number of suitable chelators for use in the imaging moieties of the present invention. Some of the chelators shown herein do not depict the chelated metal ion, although those in the art would know that the chelators may be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the metal ion is Gd(III), a preferred chelator is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N&prime;,N&Prime;, N&prime;&Prime;-tetracetic acid (DOTA) or substituted DOTA. DOTA has the structure shown below:

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Suitable R substitution groups include a wide variety of groups, as will be understood by those in the art. For example, suitable substitution groups include substitution groups disclosed for DOTA and DOTA-type compounds in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,262,532, 4,885,363, and 5,358,704.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, each position designated above may have two R groups attached (R&prime; and R&Prime;), although in a preferred embodiment only a single non-hydrogen R group is attached at any particular position; that is, preferably at least one of the R groups at each position is hydrogen. Thus, if R is an alkyl or aryl group, there is generally an additional hydrogen attached to the carbon, although not depicted herein. In a preferred embodiment, one R group is a blocking moiety and the other R groups are hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;alkyl group&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant a straight or branched chain alkyl group, with straight chain alkyl groups being preferred.

In some embodiments, two adjacent R groups may be bonded together to form ring structures together with the carbon atoms of the chelator, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,704, expressly incorporated by reference. These ring structures may be similarly substituted. </paragraph>

In addition, the alkyl amine may have other substitution groups, as outlined above for alkyl group. The amine may be primary (&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>R), secondary (&mdash;NHR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), or tertiary (&mdash;NR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). When the amine is a secondary or tertiary amine, suitable R groups are alkyl groups as defined above. A preferred alkyl amine is p-aminobenzyl. When the alkyl amine serves as the coordination site barrier, as described below, preferred embodiments utilize the nitrogen atom of the amine as a coordination atom, for example when the alkyl amine includes a pyridine or pyrrole ring. </paragraph>

That is, the alkyl and aryl groups may be substituted, with one or more substitution groups. For example, a phenyl group may be a substituted phenyl group. Suitable substitution groups include, but are not limited to, halogens such as chlorine, bromine and fluorine, amines, hydroxy groups, carboxylic acids, nitro groups, carbonyl and other alkyl and aryl groups as defined herein. Thus, arylalkyl and hydroxyalkyl groups are also suitable for use in the invention. Preferred substitution groups include alkyl amines and alkyl hydroxy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In addition to alkyl and aryl groups as outlined herein, the X moiety may be a peptide-based molecule. By &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; or &ldquo;polypeptide&rdquo; herein is meant a compound of about 2 to about 15 amino acid residues covalently linked by peptide bonds. Preferred embodiments utilize polypeptides from about 2 to about 8 amino acids, with about 2 to about 4 being the most preferred. Preferably, the amino acids are naturally occurring amino acids, although amino acid analogs and peptidomimitic structures are also useful, particularly when the peptide serves as all or part of the X moiety, or in the design of inhibitors or ligands. Under certain circumstances, the peptide may be only a single amino acid residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the X moiety is a peptidyl moiety that comprises a peptide backbone and utilizes either naturally occurring or synthetic side chains to serve as &ldquo;arms&rdquo;, e.g. the linkers and coordination moieties of the chelate structures. This may be particularly preferred for synthesis, when amino acid analogs with either complete &ldquo;arms&rdquo; or chemical functional groups that facilitate the addition of other components such as linkers and coordination moieties are used. That is, synthetic amino acid analogs can be made and then linked together to form the chelate structures of the invention using standard solid phase synthesis. In some cases, naturally occurring amino acids that already comprise chemically useful groups for the attachment of additional linker atoms and/or coordination moieties can be used; for example, lysines and arginines already contain a primary amine that can be used for subsequent attachment of additional chemistry. In some embodiments, the side chains of the peptide can serve partially as the linker moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the structures outlined herein, Y can be a linker. As for the X moieties outlined herein, the skilled artisan will appreciated that a wide variety of Y moieties are possible as well.

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Other suitable Gd(III) chelators are described in Alexander, supra, Jackels, supra, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,215, 5,087,440, 5,219,553, 5,188,816, 4,885,363, 5,358,704, 5,262,532, and Meyer et al., Invest. Radiol. 25: S53 (1990), among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When the paramagnetic ion is Fe(III), appropriate chelators will have less than 6 coordination atoms, since Fe(III) is capable of binding 6 coordination atoms. Suitable chelators for Fe(III) ions are well known in the art, see for example Lauffer et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:1622 (1987); Lauffer, Chem. Rev. 87:901-927 (1987); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,885,363, 5,358,704, and 5,262,532, all which describe chelators suitable for Fe(III). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the paramagnetic ion is Mn(II) (Mn&plus;2), appropriate chelators will have less than 5 or 6 coordination atoms, since Mn(II) is capable of binding 6 or 7 coordination atoms. Suitable chelators for Mn(II) ions are well known in the art; see for example Lauffer, Chem. Rev. 87:901-927 (1987) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,885,363, 5,358,704, and 5,262,532. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the paramagnetic ion is Yt(III), appropriate chelators will have less than 7 or 8 coordination atoms, since Yt(III) is capable of binding 8 or 9 coordination atoms. Suitable chelators forYt(III) ions include, but are not limited to, DOTA and DPTA and derivatives thereof (see Moi et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110:6266-6267 (1988)) and those chelators described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,363 and others, as outlined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the paramagnetic ion is Dy&plus;3 (Dy(III)), appropriate chelators will have less than 7 or 8 coordination atoms, since Dylll is capable of binding 8 or 9 coordination atoms. Suitable chelators are known in the art, as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the chelator and the blocking moiety are covalently linked; that is, the blocking moiety is a substitution group on the chelator. In this embodiment, the substituted chelator, with the bound metal ion, comprises the metal ion complex which in the absence of the target substance has all possible coordination sites occupied or blocked; i.e. it is coordinatively saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the chelator and the blocking moiety are not covalently attached. In this embodiment, the blocking moiety has sufficient affinity for the metal ion to prevent the rapid exchange of water molecules in the absence of the target substance. However, in this embodiment the blocking moiety has a higher affinity for the target substance than for the metal ion. Accordingly, in the presence of the target substance, the blocking moiety will have a tendency to be dislodged from the metal ion to interact with the target substance, thus freeing up a coordination site in the metal ion complex and allowing the rapid exchange of water and an increase in relaxivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> What is important is that the metal ion complex, comprising the metal ion, the chelator and the blocking moiety, is not readily able to rapidly exchange water molecules when the blocking moieties are in the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion, such that in the absence of the target substance, there is less or little substantial image enhancement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the R group is a blocking moiety. In addition, at least one of the groups associated with the chelator (either an R group or a designated BM) is a blocking moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;blocking moiety&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant a functional group associated with the chelator metal ion complexes of the invention which is capable of interacting with a target substance and which is capable, under certain circumstances, of substantially blocking the exchange of water in at least one inner coordination site of the metal ion of the metal ion complex. For example, when bound to or associated with the metal ion complexes of the invention, the blocking moiety occupies or blocks at least one coordination site of the metal ion in the absence of the target substance. Thus, the metal ion is coordinately saturated with the chelator and the blocking moiety or moieties in the absence of the target substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A blocking moiety may comprise several components. The blocking moiety has a functional moiety which is capable of interacting with a target substance, as outlined below. This functional moiety may or may not provide the coordination atom(s) of the blocking moiety. In addition, blocking moieties may comprise one or more linker groups to allow for correct spacing and attachment of the components of the blocking moiety. Furthermore, in the embodiment where the functional group of the blocking moiety does not contribute a coordination atom, the blocking moiety may comprise a coordination site barrier, which serves to either provide a coordination site atom or sterically prevent the rapid exchange of water at the coordination site; i.e. the coordination site barrier may either occupy or block the coordination site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;capable of interacting with a target substance&rdquo; herein is meant that the blocking moiety has an affinity for the target substance, such that the blocking moiety will stop blocking or occupying at least one coordination site of the metal ion complex when the target substance is present. Thus, as outlined above, the blocking moiety is blocking or occupying at least one coordination site of the metal ion in the absence of the target substance. However, in the presence of the target substance, the blocking moiety associates or interacts with the target substance and is released from its association with the metal ion, thus freeing at least one coordination site of the metal ion such that the rapid exchange of water can occur at this site, resulting in image enhancement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The nature of the interaction between the blocking moiety and the target substance will depend on the target substance to be detected or visualized via MRI. For example, suitable target substances include, but are not limited to, enzymes; proteins; peptides; nucleic acids; ions such as Ca&plus;2, Mg&plus;2, Zn&plus;2, K&plus;, Cl&minus;, and Na&plus;; cAMP; receptors such as cell-surface receptors and ligands; hormones; antigens; antibodies; ATP; NADH; NADPH; FADH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; FNNH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; coenzyme A (acyl CoA and acetyl CoA); and biotin, among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the nature of the interaction is irreversible, such that the blocking moiety does not reassociate to block or occupy the coordination site; for example, when the blocking moiety comprises an enzyme substrate which is cleaved upon exposure to the target enzyme. Alternatively, the nature of the interaction is reversible, such that the blocking moiety will reassociate with the complex to hinder the exchange of water; for example, when the blocking moiety comprises an ion ligand, or a receptor ligand, as outlined below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The corresponding blocking moieties will be enzyme substrates or inhibitors, receptor ligands, antibodies, antigens, ion binding compounds, substantially complementary nucleic acids, nucleic acid binding proteins, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the target substance is an enzyme, and the blocking moiety is an enzyme substrate. In this embodiment, the blocking moiety is cleaved from the metal ion complex of the invention, allowing the exchange of water in at least one coordination site of the metal ion complex. This embodiment allows the amplification of the image enhancement since a single molecule of the target substance is able to generate many activated metal ion complexes, i.e. metal ion complexes in which the blocking moiety is no longer occupying or blocking a coordination site of the metal ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the possible enzyme target substances are quite broad. The target substance enzyme may be chosen on the basis of a correlation to a disease condition, for example, for diagnostic purposes. Alternatively, the metal ion complexes of the present invention may be used to establish such correlations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Suitable classes of enzymes include, but are not limited to, hydrolases such as proteases, carbohydrases, lipases and nucleases; isomerases such as racemases, epimerases, tautomerases, or mutases; transferases, kinases and phophatases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the potential list of suitable enzyme targets is quite large. Enzymes associated with the generation or maintenance of arterioschlerotic plaques and lesions within the circulatory system, inflammation, wounds, immune response, tumors, may all be detected using the present invention. Enzymes such as lactase, maltase, sucrase or invertase, cellulase, &agr;-amylase, aldolases, glycogen phosphorylase, kinases such as hexokinase, proteases such as serine, cysteine, aspartyl and metalloproteases may also be detected, including, but not limited to, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and other therapeutically relevant serine proteases such as tPA and the other proteases of the thrombolytic cascade; cysteine proteases including: the cathepsins, including cathepsin B, L, S, H, J, N and O; and calpain;; metalloproteinases including MMP-1 through MMP-10, particularly MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9; and caspases, such as caspase-3, -5, -8 and other caspases of the apoptotic pathway, and, interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE). Similarly, bacterial and viral infections may be detected via characteristic bacterial and viral enzymes. As will be appreciated in the art, this list is not meant to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Once the target enzyme is identified or chosen, enzyme substrate blocking moieties can be designed using well known parameters of enzyme substrate specificities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> For example, when the enzyme target substance is a protease, the blocking moiety may be a peptide or polypeptide which is capable of being cleaved by the target protease. By &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; or &ldquo;polypeptide&rdquo; herein is meant a compound of about 2 to about 15 amino acid residues covalently linked by peptide bonds. Preferred embodiments utilize polypeptides from about 2 to about 8 amino acids, with about 2 to about 4 being the most preferred. Preferably, the amino acids are naturally occurring amino acids, although amino acid analogs and peptidomimitic structures are also useful. Under certain circumstances, the peptide may be only a single amino acid residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Preferred target substance/peptide blocking moiety pairs include, but are not limited to, cat B and GGGF; cat B and GFQGVQFAGF; cat B and GFGSVGFAGF; cat B and GLVGGAGAGF; cat B and GGFLGLGAGF; cat D and GFGSTFFAGF; caspase-3 and DEVD; MMP-7 and PELR; MMP-7 and PLGLAR; MMP-7 and PGLWA-(D-arg); MMP-7 and PMALWMR; and MMP-7 and PMGLRA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when the enzyme target substance is a carbohydrase, the blocking moiety will be a carbohydrate group which is capable of being cleaved by the target carbohydrase. For example, when the enzyme target is lactase or &bgr;-galactosidase, the enzyme substrate blocking moiety is lactose or galactose. Similar enzyme/blocking moiety pairs include sucrase/sucrose, maltase/maltose, and &agr;-amylase/amylose. In addition, the addition of carbohydrate moieties such as galactose, outlined herein, can alter the biodistribution of the agents; for example, the galactose blocking moieties outlined herein cause concentration in liver, kidneys and spleen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the blocking moiety may be an enzyme inhibitor, such that in the presence of the enzyme, the inhibitor blocking moiety disassociates from the metal ion complex to interact or bind to the enzyme, thus freeing an inner coordination sphere site of the metal ion for interaction with water. As above, the enzyme inhibitors are chosen on the basis of the enzyme target substance and the corresponding known characteristics of the enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the blocking moiety is a phosphorus moiety, as defined above, such as &mdash;OPO(OR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>))<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 10, with from 1 to 5 being preferred and, to 3 being particularly preferred. Each R is independently hydrogen or a substitution group as defined herein, with hydrogen being preferred. This embodiment is particularly useful when the target molecule is alkaline phosphatase or a phosphodiesterase, or other enzymes known to cleave phosphorus containing moieties such as these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the blocking moiety is a nucleic acid. The nucleic acid may be single-stranded or double stranded, and includes nucleic acid analogs such as peptide nucleic acids and other well-known modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone, such as phosphorthioates, phosphoramidates, morpholino structures, etc. The target molecule can be a substantially complementary nucleic acid or a nulceic acid binding moiety, such as a protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the target substance is a physiological agent. As for the enzyme/substrate embodiment, the physiological agent interacts with the blocking moiety of the metal ion complex, such that in the presence of the physiological agent, there is rapid exchange of water in at least one inner sphere coordination site of the metal ion complex. Thus, the target substance may be a physiologically active ion, and the blocking moiety is an ion binding ligand. For example, as shown in the Examples, the target substance may be the Ca&plus;2 ion, and the blocking moiety may be a calcium binding ligand such as is known in the art (see Grynkiewicz et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260(6):3440-3450 (1985); Haugland, R. P., Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals (1989-1991)). Other suitable target ions include Mn&plus;2, Mg&plus;2, Zn&plus;2, Na&plus;, and Cl&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When Ca&plus;2 is the target substance, preferred blocking moieties include, but are not limited to, the acetic acid groups of bis(o-amino-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), ethylene glycol bis(&bgr;-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetraacetic acid (EGTA); ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA); and derivatives thereof, such as disclosed in Tsien, Biochem. 19:2396-2404 (1980). Other known chelators of Ca&plus;2 and other divalent ions, such as quin2 (2-&lsqb;&lsqb;2-&lsqb;bis(carboxymethyl)amino&rsqb;-5-methylphenoxy&rsqb;methyl-6-methoxy-8-&lsqb;bis(carboxymethyl)amino&rsqb;quinoline; fura-1, fura-2, fura-3, stil-1, stil-2 and indo-1 (see Grynkiewicz et al., supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As for the enzyme/substrate embodiments, the metabolite may be associated with a particular disease or condition within an animal. For example, as outlined below, BAPTA-DOTA derivatives may be used to diagnose Alzeheimer&apos;s disease and other neurological disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the blocking moiety is a ligand for a cell-surface receptor or is a ligand which has affinity for a extracellular component. In this embodiment, as for the physiological agent embodiment, the ligand has sufficient affinity for the metal ion to prevent the rapid exchange of water molecules in the absence of the target substance. Alternatively, there may be R groups &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the ligand into place, as described herein, resulting in either the contribution of a coordination atom or that the ligand serves as a coordination site barrier. In this embodiment the ligand blocking moiety has a higher affinity for the target substance than for the metal ion. Accordingly, in the presence of the target substance, the ligand blocking moiety will interact with the target substance, thus freeing up at least one coordination site in the metal ion complex and allowing the rapid exchange of water and an increase in relaxivity. Additionally, in this embodiment, this may result in the accumulation of the MRI contrast agent at the location of the target, for example at the cell surface. This may be similar to the situation where the blocking moiety is an enzyme inhibitor, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the blocking moiety is a photocleavable moiety. That is, upon exposure to a certain wavelength of light, the blocking moiety is cleaved, allowing an increase in the exchange rate of water in at least one coordination site of the complex. This embodiment has particular use in developmental biology fields (cell lineage, neuronal development, etc.), where the ability to follow the fates of particular cells is desirable. Suitable photocleavable moieties are similar to &ldquo;caged&rdquo; reagents which are cleaved upon exposure to light. A particularly preferred class of photocleavable moieties are the O-nitrobenzylic compounds, which can be synthetically incorporated into a blocking moiety via an ether, thioether, ester (including phosphate esters), amine or similar linkage to a heteroatom (particularly oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur). Also of use are benzoin-based photocleavable moieties. A wide variety of suitable photocleavable moieties is outlined in the Molecular Probes Catalog, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compounds have a structure depicted below in Structure 18, which depicts a nitrobenzyl photocleavable group, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide variety of other moieties may be used:

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Structure 18 depicts a DOTA-type chelator, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, other chelators may be used as well. R<highlight><subscript>26 </subscript></highlight>is a linker as defined below. Similarly, the X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>group may be as defined above, although additional structures may be used, for example a coordination site barrier as outlined herein. Similarly, there may be substitutent groups on the aromatic ring, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Included within the definition of &ldquo;blocking moiety&rdquo; is the therapeutic blocking moiety. By &ldquo;therapeutic blocking moiety&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant a moiety with several essential functions. First, some component of the therapeutic blocking moiety must be capable of substantially inhibiting the exchange of water in at least one inner coordination site of the metal ion of the metal ion complex. Second, some component of the therapeutic blocking moiety must be capable of effecting a therapeutic effect, i.e. altering the function of its physiological target substance. In addition, a further requirement is that as a result of either the interaction of the therapeutic blocking moiety with the physiological target substance or as a result of the action of a separate enzyme such as a protease on a cleavage site present in the therapeutic blocking moiety, the exchange of water in at least one inner coordination site of the metal ion is increased. As is more fully described below, this is generally done as a result of a cleavage of some or all of the therapeutic blocking moiety off the chelator, although other types of interactions can be utilized as well. As is more fully described below, each of these functions may be accomplished by a single component, or multiple components are used, together forming the therapeutic blocking moiety. That is, for example, the therapeutically active agent may provide the coordination atom(s). Furthermore, as is more fully described below, the therapeutic blocking moiety may comprise a targeting moiety to allow targeting of the drug moiety to a particular target. Finally, therapeutic blocking moieties may comprise one or more linker groups to allow for correct spacing and attachment of the components of the therapeutic blocking moiety as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a therapeutic blocking moiety can comprise one or more several components, as described herein. At a minimum, a therapeutic blocking moiety comprises a &ldquo;therapeutically active agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;drug moiety&rdquo; capable of causing a therapeutic effect, that is, it alters a biological function of a physiological target substance. As described below, this drug moiety may or may not provide the coordination atom(s) of the therapeutic blocking moiety. By &ldquo;causing a therapeutic effect&rdquo; or &ldquo;therapeutically effective&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant that the drug alters the biological function of its intended physiological target in a manner sufficient to cause a therapeutic and phenotypic effect. By &ldquo;alters&rdquo; or &ldquo;modulates the biological function&rdquo; herein is meant that the physiological target undergoes a change in either the quality or quantity of its biological activity; this includes increases or decreases in activity. Thus, therapeutically active agents include a wide variety of drugs, including antagonists, for example enzyme inhibitors, and agonists, for example a transcription factor which results in an increase in the expression of a desirable gene product (although as will be appreciated by those in the art, antagonistic transcription factors may also be used), are all included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutically active agent is cleaved from the MRI contrast agent, as is more fully described below. In this embodiment, as a result of cleavage of the therapeutic blocking moiety and the release of the therapeutically active agent, a coordination site of the MRI contrast agent is no longer occupied by a coordination atom and water is free to exchange in this site, leading to signal enhancement. Furthermore, the drug is now free to interact with its target, which may or may not be the same molecule which does the cleavage; for example, the cleavage site may comprise an enzyme substrate, for example of an HIV protease, and the drug may comprise an inhibitor of the same enzyme. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the nature of the interaction is irreversible; the coordination atom released from the MRI contrast agent does not reassociate to block or occupy the coordination site. This embodiment allows the amplification of the image enhancement since a single cleavage agent leads to the generation of many activated metal ion complexes, i.e. metal ion complexes in which the therapeutic blocking moiety is no longer occupying or blocking a coordination site of the metal ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the therapeutically active agent need not be cleaved from the MRI contrast agent to be active. Thus, for example, as is more fully described below, some agents can remain associated with the MRI contrast agent; what is important in this instance is that the association of the drug with its target causes a conformational alteration that results in a coordination site, originally occupied by a coordination atom from the therapeutic blocking moiety, to become vacated, allowing an increase in the exchange of water and thus image enhancement. That is, the affinity of the drug for its target is greater than the affinity of the therapeutic blocking moiety for the MRI contrast agent. Depending on the nature of the interaction of the drug with its physiological target, this may or may not be a reversible interaction. That is, in some cases, for example in the case of certain enzyme inhibitors, the interaction is effectively irreversible, leading to an enzyme active site being occupied with a drug attached to an MRI contrast agent. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the interaction is reversible, and an equilibrium is established between having the drug associated with its target (leading to image enhancement) and having the therapeutic blocking moiety associated with the MRI contrast agent (hindering the exchange of water and thus a loss of signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The nature of the therapeutic effect between the therapeutically active moiety and the physiological target substance will depend on the both the physiological target substance and the nature of the effect. In general, suitable physiological target substances include, but are not limited to, proteins (including peptides and oligopeptides) including ion channels and enzymes; nucleic acids; ions such as Ca&plus;2, Mg&plus;2, Zn&plus;2, K&plus;, Cl&minus;, Na&plus;, and toxic Eins including those of Fe, Pb, Hg and Se; cAMP; receptors including G-protein coupled receptors and cell-surface receptors and ligands; hormones; antigens; antibodies; ATP; NADH; NADPH; FADH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; FNNH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; coenzyme A (acyl CoA and acetyl CoA); and biotin, among others. Physiological target substances include enzymes and proteins associated with a wide variety of viruses including orthomyxoviruses, (e.g. influenza virus), paramyxoviruses (e.g respiratory syncytial virus, mumps virus, measles virus), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses, togaviruses (e.g. rubella virus), parvoviruses, poxviruses (e.g. variola virus, vaccinia virus), enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus), hepatitis viruses (including A, B and C), herpesviruses (e.g. Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus), rotaviruses, Norwalk viruses, hantavirus, arenavirus, rhabdovirus (e.g. rabies virus), retroviruses (including HIV, HTLV-I and -II), papovaviruses (e.g. papillomavirus), polyomaviruses, and picornaviruses, and the like. Similarly, bacterial targets can come from a wide variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic prokaryotes of interest including Bacillus; Vibrio, e.g. <highlight><italic>V. cholerae; </italic></highlight>Escherichia, e.g. Enterotoxigenic <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, Shigella, e.g. <highlight><italic>S. dysenteriae; </italic></highlight>Salmonella, e.g. <highlight><italic>S. typhi; </italic></highlight>Mycobacterium e.g. <highlight><italic>M. tuberculosis, M. leprae; </italic></highlight>Clostridium, e.g. <highlight><italic>C. botulinum, C. tetani, C. difficile, C.perfringens</italic></highlight>; Cornyebacterium, e.g. <highlight><italic>C. diphtherae; </italic></highlight>Streptococcus, <highlight><italic>S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae; </italic></highlight>Staphylococcus, e.g. <highlight><italic>S. aureus; </italic></highlight>Haemophilus, e.g. <highlight><italic>H. influenzae; </italic></highlight>Neisseria, e.g. <highlight><italic>N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae</italic></highlight>; Yersinia, e.g. <highlight><italic>G. lamblia Y. pestis, </italic></highlight>Pseudomonas, e.g. <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa, P. putida; </italic></highlight>Chlamydia, e.g. <highlight><italic>C. trachomatis; </italic></highlight>Bordetella, e.g. <highlight><italic>B. pertussis; </italic></highlight>Treponema, e.g. <highlight><italic>T. palladium; </italic></highlight>and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Once the physiological target substance has been identified, a corresponding therapeutically active agent is chosen.

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutically active compound is a radio-sensitizer drug. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutically active compound is an anti-inflammatory drug (either steroidal or non-steroidal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutically active compound is involved in angiogenesis. Suitable guarding moieties include, but are not limited to, endostatin, angiostatin, interferons, platelet factor 4 (PF4), thrombospondin, transforming growth factor beta, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1, -2 and -3 (TIMP-1, -2 and -3), TNP-470, Marimastat, Neovastat, BMS-275291, COL-3, AG3340, Thalidomide, Squalamine, Combrestastatin, SU5416, SU6668, IFN-&agr;, EMD121974, CAI, IL-12 abnd IM862. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The blocking moiety itself may block or occupy at least one coordination site of the metal ion. That is, one or more atoms of the blocking moiety (i.e. the enzyme substrate, ligand, moiety which interacts with a physiological agent, photocleavable moiety, etc.) itself serves as a coordination atom, or otherwise blocks access to the metal ion by steric hinderance. For example, it appears that one or more of the atoms of the galactose blocking moiety outlined in the Examples may be direct coordination atoms for the Gd(III) metal ion. Similarly, peptide based blocking moieties for protease targets may contribute coordination atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the blocking moiety further comprises a &ldquo;coordination site barrier&rdquo; which is covalently tethered to the complex in such a manner as to allow disassociation upon interaction with a target substance. For example, it may be tethered by one or more enzyme substrate blocking moieties. In this embodiment, the coordination site barrier blocks or occupies at least one of the coordination sites of the metal ion in the absence of the target enzyme substance. Coordination site barriers are used when coordination atoms are not provided by the functional portion of the blocking moiety, i.e. the component of the blocking moiety which interacts with the target substance. The blocking moiety or moieties such as an enzyme substrate serves as the tether, covalently linking the coordination site barrier to the metal ion complex. In the presence of the enzyme target, the enzyme cleaves one or more of the enzyme substrates, either within the substrate or at the point of attachment to the metal ion complex, thus freeing the coordination site barrier. The coordination site or sites are no longer blocked and the bulk water is free to rapidly exchange at the coordination site of the metal ion, thus enhancing the image. As will be appreciated by those in the art, a similar result can be accomplished with other types of blocking moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the coordination site barrier is attached to the metal ion complex at one end. When the enzyme target cleaves the substrate blocking moiety, the coordination site barrier is released. In another embodiment, the coordination site barrier is attached to the metal ion complex with more than one substrate blocking moiety for two attachments. The enzyme target may cleave only one side, thus removing the coordination site barrier and allowing the exchange of water at the coordination site, but leaving the coordination site barrier attached to the metal ion complex. Alternatively, the enzyme may cleave the coordination site barrier completely from the metal ion complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the coordination site barrier occupies at least one of the coordination sites of the metal ion. That is, the coordination site barrier contains at least one atom which serves as at least one coordination atom for the metal ion. In this embodiment, the coordination site barrier may be a heteroalkyl group, such as an alkyl amine group, as defined above, including alkyl pyridine, alkyl pyrroline, alkyl pyrrolidine, and alkyl pyrole, or a carboxylic or carbonyl group. The portion of the coordination site barrier which does not contribute the coordination atom may also be consider a linker group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the coordination site barrier does not directly occupy a coordination site, but instead blocks the site sterically. In this embodiment, the coordination site barrier may be an alkyl or substituted group, as defined above, or other groups such as peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the coordination site barrier is preferably linked via two enzyme substrates to opposite sides of the metal ion complex, effectively &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; the coordination site barrier over the coordination site or sites of the metal ion complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the coordination site barrier may be &ldquo;stretched&rdquo; via an enzyme substrate on one side, covalently attached to the metal ion complex, and a linker moeity, as defined below, on the other. In an alternative embodiment, the coordination site barrier is linked via a single enzyme substrate on one side; that is, the affinity of the coordination site barrier for the metal ion is higher than that of water, and thus the blocking moiety, comprising the coordination site barrier and the enzyme substrate, will block or occupy the available coordination sites in the absence of the target enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the metal ion complexes of the invention have a single associated or bound blocking moiety. In such embodiments, the single blocking moiety impedes the exchange of water molecules in at least one coordination site. Alternatively, as is outlined below, a single blocking moiety may hinder the exchange of water molecules in more than one coordination site, or coordination sites on different chelators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, two or more blocking moieties are associated with a single metal ion complex, to implede the exchange of water in at least one or more coordination sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the blocking moieties of the present invention may further comprise a linker group as well as a functional blocking moiety. That is, blocking moieties may comprise functional blocking moieties in combination with a linker group and/or a coordination site barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Linker groups (sometimes depicted herein as R<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>) will be used to optimize the steric considerations of the metal ion complex. That is, in order to optimize the interaction of the blocking moiety with the metal ion, linkers may be introduced to allow the functional blocking moiety to block or occupy the coordination site. In general, the linker group is chosen to allow a degree of structural flexibility. For example, when a blocking moiety interacts with a physiological agent which does not result in the blocking moiety being cleaved from the complex, the linker must allow some movement of the blocking moiety away from the complex, such that the exchange of water at at least one coordination site is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Generally, suitable linker groups include, but are not limited to, alkyl and aryl groups, including substituted alkyl and aryl groups and heteroalkyl (particularly oxo groups) and heteroaryl groups, including alkyl amine groups, as defined above. Preferred linker groups include p-aminobenzyl, substituted p-aminobenzyl, diphenyl and substituted diphenyl, alkyl furan such as benzylfuran, carboxy, and straight chain alkyl groups of 1 to 10 carbons in length. Particularly preferred linkers include p-aminobenzyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, acetic acid, propionic acid, aminobutyl, p-alkyl phenols, 4-alkylimidazole. The selection of the linker group is generally done using well known molecular modeling techniques, to optimize the obstruction of the coordination site or sites of the metal ion. The length of the linker, i.e., the spacer between the chelator and the coordination atom(s) of the blocking moiety, may contribute to the steric conformation and association of the coordination atoms with the metal ion, thus allowing blocking of the metal ion by the blocking moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a coordination site barrier can be attached by a cleavable linker as outlined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment esterase linkages are used. Esterase linkages are particularly preferred when the blocking moiety is attached via an &ldquo;arm&rdquo; of the chelate, as the product of an esterase reaction is a carboxylic acid, which thus allows the regeneration of a stable chelate (and, in the case of DOTA and DPTA, chelates that are approved for human use). Alternatively, cleavable peptide linkers can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The blocking moiety is attached to the metal ion complex in a variety of ways. In a preferred embodiment, as noted above, the blocking moiety is attached to the metal ion complex via a linker group. Alternatively, the blocking moiety is attached directly to the metal ion complex; for example, as outlined below, the blocking moiety may be a substituent group on the chelator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment at least one of the R groups attached to the &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of the chelator, for example R<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>or R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>of the DOTA structures, or R<highlight><subscript>13</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>17</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>or R<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>of the comprises an alkyl (including substituted and heteroalkyl groups), or aryl (including substituted and heteroaryl groups), i.e. is a group sterically bulkier than hydrogen. This is particular useful to drive the equilibrium towards &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the coordination atom of the arm into place to prevent water exchange, as is known for standard MRI contrast agents. Preferred groups include the C1 through C6 alkyl groups with methyl being particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> This is particularly preferred when the blocking moiety is attached via one of the &ldquo;arms&rdquo;, for example when a blocking moiety is at position X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to X<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(Structure 6), position S, T, U or V (Structure 8) or position H, I, J or K of Structure 16. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> However the inclusion of too many groups may drive the equilibrium in the other direction effectively locking the coordination atom out of position, as is shown in Example 3. Therefore in a preferred embodiment only 1 or 2 of these positions is a non-hydrogen group, unless other methods are used to drive the equilibrium towards binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The blocking moieties are chosen and designed using a variety of parameters. In the embodiment which uses a coordination site barrier, i.e. when the functional group of the blocking moiety does not provide a coordination atom, and the coordination site barrier is fastened or secured on two sides, the affinity of the coordination site barrier of the blocking moiety for the metal ion complex need not be great, since it is tethered in place. That is, in this embodiment, the complex is &ldquo;off&rdquo; in the absence of the target substance. However, in the embodiment where the blocking moiety is linked to the complex in such a manner as to allow some rotation or flexibility of the blocking moiety, for example, it is linked on one side only, such as the galactose embodiment of the examples, the blocking moiety should be designed such that it occupies the coordination site a majority of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> When the blocking moiety is not covalently tethered on two sides, it should be understood that blocking moieties and coordination site barriers are chosen to maximize three basic interactions that allow the blocking moiety to be sufficiently associated with the complex to hinder the rapid exchange of water in at least one coordination site of the complex. First, there may be electrostatic interactions between the blocking moiety and the metal ion, to allow the blocking moiety to associate with the complex. Secondly, there may be Van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions. Thirdly, there may be ligand interactions, that is, one or more functionalities of the blocking moiety may serve as coordination atoms for the metal. In addition, linker groups may be chosen to force or favor certain conformations, to drive the equilibrium towards an associated blocking moiety. Similarly, removing degrees of fredom in the molecule may force a particular conformation to prevail. Thus, for example, the addition of alkyl groups, and particularly methyl groups, at positions equivalent to the R<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>to R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>positions of Structure 7 when the blocking moiety is attached at W, X, Y or Z, can lead the blocking moiety to favor the blocking position. Similar restrictions can be made in the other embodiments, as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, effective &ldquo;tethering&rdquo; of the blocking moiety down over the metal ion may also be done by engineering in other non-covalent interactions that will serve to increase the affinity of the blocking moiety to the chelator complex, as is depicted below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Potential blocking moieties may be easily tested to see if they are functional; that is, if they sufficiently occupy or block the appropriate coordination site or sites of the complex to prevent rapid exchange of water. Thus, for example, complexes are made with potential blocking moieties and then compared with the chelator without the blocking moiety in imaging experiments. Once it is shown that the blocking moiety is a sufficient &ldquo;blocker&rdquo;, the target substance is added and the experiments repeated, to show that interaction with the target substance increases the exchange of water and thus enhances the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Thus, as outlined above, the metal ion complexes of the present invention comprise a paramagnetic metal ion bound to a chelator and at least one blocking moiety. In a preferrred embodiment, the metal ion complexes have the formula shown in Structure 6:

Alternatively, the coordination sites are either filled by coordination atoms provided by the S, T, U or V groups, or blocked by the S, T, U or V structure, or both.

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As applied to DOTA, the four nitrogens of the DOTA ring, and the (generally) three S, T and U groups provide 7 of the coordination atoms for the Gd(III) paramagnetic metal ion. The eigth and ninth coordination atoms are provided by a blocking moiety which is substituted at one of the S, T, U and V positions.

It is to be understood that when one or more of these bonds are double bonds, there may be only a single substitutent group attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, when A is a double bond, there may be only a single R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a single R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>group attached to the respective carbons; in a preferred embodiment, as described below, the R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups are hydrogen.

Without being bound by theory, it appears that one of the carboxy groups of the BAPTA moiety serves to provide a coordination atom in the absence of Ca&plus;2. However, in the presence of Ca&plus;2, the carboxy group chelates Ca&plus;2, and thus is unavailable as a coordination group, thus allowing the rapid exchange of water. Preferably, the metal ion is Gd(III), the R groups are all hydrogen, and the W, X, Y and Z groups are carboxy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the blocking moiety comprises two linkers, two carbohydrates, and a coordination site barrier. The carbohydrates are attached to the complex via a linkage which will be recognized by a carbohydrase such as a &bgr;(1, 4) linkage such as is recognized by lactose or &bgr;-galactosidase. The R<highlight><subscript>22 </subscript></highlight>group provides a coordination atom in the absence of the carbohydrase such there is no rapid exchange of water in the complex. Upon exposure to the carbohydrase, such as &bgr;-galactosidase, one or both of the carbohydrate blocking moieties are cleaved off, removing the coordination atom and allowing the rapid exchange of water. Preferably, the R groups are hydrogen, and the W, X, Y and Z groups are carboxy. Alternatively, the blocking moiety could comprise peptides for a protease target substance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> b) at least one R comprises a BM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the chelators are linked together directly, using at least one functional group on each chelator. This may be accomplished using any number of stable bifunctional groups well known in the art, including homobifunctional and heterobifunctional linkers (see Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994, pages T155-T200, hereby expressly incorporated by reference). This may result in direct linkage, for example when one chelator comprises a primary amine as a functional group and the second comprises a carboxy group as the functional group, and carbodiimide is used as an agent to activate the carboxy for attach by the nucleophilic amine (see Torchilin et al., <highlight><italic>Critical Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, </italic></highlight>7(4):275-308 (1991). Alternatively, as will be appreciated by those in the art, the use of some bifunctional linkers results in a short coupling moiety being present in the structure. A &ldquo;coupling moiety&rdquo; is capable of covalently linking two or more entities. In this embodiment, one end or part of the coupling moiety is attached to the first MRI contrast agent, and the other is attached to the second MRI contrast agent. The functional group(s) of the coupling moiety are generally attached to additional atoms, such as alkyl or aryl groups (including hetero alkyl and aryl, and substituted derivatives), to form the coupling moiety. Oxo linkers are also preferred. As will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide range of coupling moieties are possible, and are generally only limited by the ability to synthesize the molecule and the reactivity of the functional group. Generally, the coupling moiety comprises at least one carbon atom, due to synthetic requirements; however, in some embodiments, the coupling moiety may comprise just the functional group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the coupling moiety comprises additional atoms as a spacer. As will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide variety of groups may be used. For example, a coupling moiety may comprise an alkyl or aryl group substituted with one or more functional groups. Thus, in one embodiment, a coupling moiety containing a multiplicity of functional groups for attachment of multiple MRI contrast agents may be used, similar to the polymer embodiment described below. For example, branched alkyl groups containing multiple functional groups may be desirable in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The imaging moieties of the present invention comprise a polymer and a plurality of MRI contrast agents each linked to the polymer by a cleavable linkage. As will be appreciated by those in the art, these MRI contrast agents may be monomeric (i.e. one metal ion, one chelator, one blocking moiety) or a duplex, as is generally described below (i.e. two metal ions, two chelators, one blocking moiety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments utilize a plurality of MRI contrast agents per polymer. The number of MRI contrast agents per polymer will depend on the density of MRI contrast agents per unit length and the length of the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The character of the polymer will vary, but what is important is that the polymer either contain or can be modified to contain functional groups for the the attachment of the MRI contrast agents and, optionally, one or more target moieties. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, functionalized dextrans, styrene polymers, polyethylene and derivatives, polyanions including, but not limited to, polymers of heparin, polygalacturonic acid, mucin, nucleic acids and their analogs including those with modified ribose-phosphate backbones, the polypeptides polyglutamate and polyaspartate, as well as carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfonic acid derivatives of synthetic polymers; and polycations, including but not limited to, synthetic polycations based on acrylamide and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanetrimethylamine, poly(N-ethyl-4-vinylpyridine) or similar quarternized polypyridine, diethylaminoethyl polymers and dextran conjugates, polymyxin B sulfate, lipopolyamines, poly(allylamines) such as the strong polycation poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride), polyethyleneimine, polybrene, spermine, spermidine and polypeptides such as protamine, the histone polypeptides, polylysine, polyarginine and polyornithine; and mixtures and derivatives of these. Particularly preferred polycations are polylysine and spermidine, with the former being especially preferred. Both optical isomers of polylysine can be used. The D isomer has the advantage of having long-term resistance to cellular proteases. The L isomer has the advantage of being more rapidly cleared from the subject. As will be appreciated by those in the art, linear and branched polymers may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> A preferred polymer is polylysine, as the &mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups of the lysine side chains at high pH serve as strong nucleophiles for multiple attachment of activated chelating agents. At high pH the lysine monomers are coupled to the MRI contrast agents under conditions that yield on average 5-20% monomer substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, particularly when charged polymers are used, there may be a second polymer of opposite charge to the first that is electrostatically associated with the first polymer, to reduce the overall charge of polymer-MRI contrast agent complex. This second polymer may or may not contain MRI contrast agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The size of the polymer may vary substantially. For example, it is known that some nucleic acid vectors can deliver genes up to 100 kilobases in length, and artificial chromosomes (megabases) have been delivered to yeast. Therefore, there is no general size limit to the polymer. However, a preferred size for the polymer is from about 10 to about 50,000 monomer units, with from about 2000 to about 5000 being particularly preferred, and from about 3 to about 25 being especially preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the multimeric MRI contrast agents of the invention may be made in a variety of ways, including those described herein. What is important is that the manner of attachment does not significantly alter the functionality of the agents; that is, the agents must still be &ldquo;off&rdquo; in the absence of the target substance and &ldquo;on&rdquo; in its presence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Similarly, it should be understood that the target moieties of the invention may be made in a variety of ways, including those described herein. What is important is that the manner of attachment does not significantly alter the functionality of the target moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the MRI contrast agents of the invention are &ldquo;duplexes&rdquo;. In this embodiment, the MRI duplex comprises two chelators, each with a paramagnetic metal ion, and at least one blocking moiety that restricts the exchange of water in at least one coordination site of each chelator. In this way, a sort of signal amplification occurs, with two metal ions increasing the signal with a single target molecule. While &ldquo;duplex&rdquo; implies two chelators, it is intended to refer to complexes comprising a single blocking moiety donating coordination atoms to more than 1 metal ion/chelator complex. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the MRI contrast agents of this embodiment may have a number of different conformations. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the R<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>27 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>28 </subscript></highlight>groups can be attached to any of the positions described herein, to any R groups or X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> As outlined above, the MRI duplex moieties may also be combined into higher multimers, either by direct linkage or via attachment to a polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the chelator and the blocking moiety are covalently linked; that is, the blocking moiety is a substitution group on the chelator. In this embodiment, the substituted chelator, with the bound metal ion, comprises the metal ion complex which in the absence of the target substance has all possible coordination sites occupied or blocked; i.e. it is coordinatively saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the chelator and the blocking moiety are not covalently attached. In this embodiment, the blocking moiety has sufficient affinity for the metal ion to prevent the rapid exchange of water molecules in the absence of the target substance. However, in this embodiment the blocking moiety has a higher affinity for the target substance than for the metal ion. Accordingly, in the presence of the target substance, the blocking moiety will have a tendency to be dislodged from the metal ion to interact with the target substance, thus freeing up a coordination site in the metal ion complex and allowing the rapid exchange of water and an increase in relaxivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> What is important is that the metal ion complex, comprising the metal ion, the chelator and the blocking moiety, is not readily able to rapidly exchange water molecules when the blocking moeities are in the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion, such that in the absence of the target substance, there is less or little substantial image enhancement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention are generally synthesized using well known techniques. See, for example, Moi et al., supra; Tsien et al., supra; Borch et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., p2987 (1971); </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The contrast agents of the invention are complexed with the appropriate metal ion as is known in the art. while the structures depicted herein all comprise metal ion, it is to be understood that the contrast agents of the invention need not have a metal ion present initially. Metal ions can be added to water in the form of an oxide or in the form of a halide and treated with an equimolar amount of a contrast agent composition. The contrast agent may be added as an aqueous solution or suspension. Dilute acid or base can be added if there is a need to maintain a neutral pH. Heating at temperatures as high as 100&deg; C. may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the blocking moiety is BAPTA, as is generally depicted below in Structure 17, with propyl linking groups between the chelators and the BAPTA derivative:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the carboxylic acids of the BAPTA molecule may also be protected using acetate protecting groups, to render a neutral molecule for entry into cells, that then can be reactivated via cleavage by intracellular esterases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In addition, although Structures 17 and 19 have ethylene groups between the oxygens of the bridge of BAPTA, methylene and propylene may also be used, as well as substituted derivatives of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, A, B, C and D are single bonds, R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>are hydrogen, and each R<highlight><subscript>26 </subscript></highlight>is &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&mdash;, with the CH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>group being attached to the macrocycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The imaging moieties of the present invention can further comprise one or more targeting moieties. In a preferred embodiment, one or more targeting moieties are attached to the MRI contrast agent and/or the polymer. By the term &ldquo;targeting moiety&rdquo; herein is meant a functional group that serves to target or direct the complex to a particular location (e.g., cell type, or diseased tissue), or association (e.g., a specific binding event). In general, the targeting moiety is directed against a target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those in the art, the imaging moieties of the invention are generally injected intravenously. Thus, preferred targeting moieties are those that allow concentration of the imaging moieties or MRI contrast agents in a particular localization. Thus, for example, a targeting moiety may be used to target a molecule to a specific target protein or enzyme, or to a particular cellular location, or to a particular cell type. Suitable targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, peptides, amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, hormones including proteinaceous and steroid hormones, growth factors, receptor ligands, antigens, antibodies, sugars, dextrans, alcohols, bile acids, fatty acids, and the like. The targeting moieties may be attached o the ipolymer or MRI contrast agent in order to localize or target it to a particular site. For example, as is more fully outlined below, a therapeutically active agent such as the cobalt compounds outlined below may include a targeting moiety to specifically bind a particular protein. Alternatively, as is more fully outlined below, the imaging moieties of the invention may include a targeting moiety to target the agents to a specific cell type such as tumor cells, such as a transferrin moiety, since many tumor cells have significant transferrin receptors on their surfaces. Similarly, a targeting moiety may include components useful in targeting the imaging moieties or MRI contrast agents or the therapeutically active agents to a particular subcellular location. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the localization of proteins within a cell is a simple method for increasing effective concentration. For example, shuttling a drug into the nucleus confines them to a smaller space thereby increasing concentration. Finally, the physiological target may simply be localized to a specific compartment, and the drugs must be localized appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Thus, suitable targeting sequences include, but are not limited to, binding sequences capable of causing binding of the moiety to a predetermined molecule or class of molecules while retaining bioactivity of the expression product, (for example by using enzyme inhibitor or substrate sequences to target a class of relevant enzymes); sequences signaling selective degradation, of itself or co-bound proteins; and signal sequences capable of constitutively localizing the candidate expression products to a predetermined cellular locale, including a) subcellular locations such as the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, nucleoli, nuclear membrane, mitochondria, chloroplast, secretory vesicles, lysosome, and cellular membrane; and b) extracellular locations via a secretory signal. Particularly preferred is localization to either subcellular locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The targeting moiety may be attached, for example, at any of the R positions of the chelator, to the polymer, to a linker (including a polymer that is a linker), or to a blocking moiety. Although in a preferred embodiment the targeting moiety does not replace a coordination atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety allows targeting of the imaging moiety of the invention to a particular tissue or the surface of a cell. That is, in a preferred embodiment the MRI contrast agents of the imaging moieties of the invention need not be taken up into the cytoplasm of a cell to be activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those in the art, the targeting moieties can be attached to the imaging moiety of the present invention, particularly the polymer or MRI contrast agent, in a large number of different ways, and in a variety of configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is a peptide. For example, chemotactic peptides have been used to image tissue injury and inflammation, particularly by bacterial infection; see WO 97/14443, hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is an antibody. The term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; includes antibody fragments, as are known in the art, including Fab Fab<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the antibody targeting moieties of the invention are humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&prime;, F(ab&prime;)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin &lsqb;Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &ldquo;import&rdquo; residues, which are typically taken from an &ldquo;import&rdquo; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers &lsqb;Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988)&rsqb;, by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries &lsqb;Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 20, 222:581 (1991)&rsqb;. The techniques of Cole et al. and Boerner et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., J. Immunol. 147(1):86-95 (1991)&rsqb;. Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing of human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368:812-13 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology 14:845-51 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnology, 14:826 (1996); Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93 (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for a first target molecule and the other one is for a second target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities &lsqb;Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305:537-539 (1983)&rsqb;. Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can 10ii be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CHl) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispeciflc antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121:210 (1 986). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells &lsqb;U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980&rsqb;, and for treatment of HIV infection &lsqb;WO 91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089&rsqb;. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is directed against a cell-surface marker on a cancer cell; that is, the target molecule is a cell surface molecule. As is known in the art, there are a wide variety of antibodies known to be differentially expressed on tumor cells, including, but not limited to, HER2, VEGF, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, antibodies against virus or bacteria can be used as targeting moieties.

<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> In addition, antibodies against physiologically relevant carbohydrates may be used, including, but not limited to, antibodies against markers for breast cancer (CA15-3, CA 549, CA 27.29), mucin-like carcinoma associated antigen (MCA), ovarian cancer (CA125), pancreatic cancer (DE-PAN-2), and colorectal and pancreatic cancer (CA 19, CA 50, CA242). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is all or a portion (e.g. a binding portion) of a ligand for a cell surface receptor. Suitable ligands include, but are not limited to, all or a functional portion of the ligands that bind to a cell surface receptor selected from the group consisting of insulin receptor (insulin), insulin-like growth factor receptor (including both IGF-1 and IGF-2), growth hormone receptor, glucose transporters (particularly GLUT 4 receptor), transferrin receptor (transferrin), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF), low density lipoprotein receptor, high density lipoprotein receptor, leptin receptor, estrogen receptor (estrogen); interleukin receptors including IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-17 receptors, human growth hormone receptor, VEGF receptor (VEGF), PDGF receptor (PDGF), transforming growth factor receptor (including TGF-&agr; and TGF-&bgr;), EPO receptor (EPO), TPO receptor (TPO), ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor, prolactin receptor, and T-cell receptors. In particular, hormone ligands are preferred. Hormones include both steroid hormones and proteinaceous hormones, including, but not limited to, epinephrine, thyroxine, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, calcitonin, chorionic gonadotropin, cortictropin, follicle-stimulating hormone, glucagon, leuteinizing hormone, lipotropin, melanocyte-stimutating hormone, norepinephrine, parathryroid hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vasopressin, enkephalins, seratonin, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, cortisone, and 35 glucocorticoids and the hormones listed above. Receptor ligands include ligands that bind to receptors such as cell surface receptors, which include hormones, lipids, proteins, glycoproteins, signal transducers, growth factors, cytokines, and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is a carbohydrate. By &ldquo;carbohydrate&rdquo; herein is meant a compound with the general formula Cx(H2O)y. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and oligo- or polysaccharides are all included within the definition and comprise polymers of various sugar molecules linked via glycosidic linkages. Particularly preferred carbohydrates are those that comprise all or part of the carbohydrate component of glycosylated proteins, including monomers and oligomers of galactose, mannose, fucose, galactosamine, (particularly N-acetylglucosamine), glucosamine, glucose and sialic acid, and in particular the glycosylation component that allows binding to certain receptors such as cell surface receptors. Other carbohydrates comprise monomers and polymers of glucose, ribose, lactose, raffinose, fructose, and other biologically significant carbohydrates. In particular, polysaccharides (including, but not limited to, arabinogalactan, gum arabic, mannan, etc.) have been used to deliver MR&lsqb; contrast agents into cells; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,386, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is a lipid. &ldquo;Lipid&rdquo; as used herein includes fats, fatty oils, waxes, phospholipids, glycolipids, terpenes, fatty acids, and glycerides, particularly the triglycerides. Also included within the definition of lipids are the eicosanoids, steroids and sterols, some of which are also hormones, such as prostaglandins, opiates, and cholesterol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In addition, as will be appreciated by those in the art, any moiety which may be utilized as a blocking moiety can be used as a targeting moiety. Particularly preferred in this regard are enzyme inhibitors, as they will not be cleaved off and will serve to localize the MRI contrast agent in the location of the enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety may be used to either allow the internalization of the MRI contrast agent to the cell cytoplasm or localize it to a particular cellular compartment, such as the nucleus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is all or a portion of the HIV-1 Tat protein, and analogs and related proteins, which allows very high uptake into target cells. See for example, Fawell et al., PNAS USA 91:664 (1994); Frankel et al., Cell 55:1189 (1988); Savion et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256:1149 (1981); Derossi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:10444 (1994); and Baldin et al., EMBO J. 9:1511 (1990), all of which are incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is a nuclear localization signal (NLS). NLSs are generally short, positively charged (basic) domains that serve to direct the moiety to which they are attached to the cell&apos;s nucleus. Numerous NLS amino acid sequences have been reported including single basic NLS&apos;s such as that of the SV40 (monkey virus) large T Antigen (Pro Lys Lys Lys Arg Lys Val), Kalderon (1984), et al., Cell, 39:499-509; the human retinoic acid receptor-&bgr; nuclear localization signal (ARRRRP); NF<highlight><subscript>K</subscript></highlight>B p50 (EEVQRKRQKL; Ghosh et al., Cell 62:1019 (1990); NF<highlight><subscript>K</subscript></highlight>B p65 (EEKRKRTYE; Nolan et al., Cell 64:961 (1991); and others (see for example Boulikas, J. Cell. Biochem. 55(1):32-58 (1994), hereby incorporated by reference) and double basic NLS&apos;s exemplified by that of the Xenopus (African clawed toad) protein, nucleoplasmin (Ala Val Lys Arg Pro Ala Ala Thr Lys Lys Ala Gly Gln Ala Lys Lys Lys Lys Leu Asp), Dingwall, et al., Cell, 30:449-458, 1982 and Dingwall, et al., J. Cell Biol., 107:641-849; 1988). Numerous localization studies have demonstrated that NLSs incorporated in synthetic peptides or grafted onto reporter proteins not normally targeted to the cell nucleus cause these peptides and reporter proteins to be concentrated in the nucleus. See, for example, Dingwall, and Laskey, Ann, Rev. Cell Biol., 2:367-390, 1986; Bonnerot, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:6795-6799, 1987; Galileo, et al., Proc. Nat&rsqb;. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:458-462, 1990. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, targeting moieties for the hepatobiliary system are used; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,573,752 and 5,582,814, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Another class of suitable substitution groups are chemical functional groups that are used to add the components of the invention together, as is more fully outlined below. Thus, in general, the components of the invention are attached through the use of functional groups on each that can then be used for attachment. Preferred functional groups for attachment are amino groups, carboxy groups, oxo groups and thiol groups. These functional groups can then be attached, either directly or indirectly through the use of a linker. Linkers are well known in the art; for example, homo-or hetero-bifunctional linkers as are well known (see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog, technical section on cross-linkers, pages 155-200, incorporated herein by reference). Preferred linkers include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups (including substituted alkyl groups and alkyl groups containing heteroatom moieties), with short alkyl groups, esters, amide, amine, epoxy groups, nucleic acids, peptides and ethylene glycol and derivatives being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The substitution group may also be hydrogen or a therapeutic blocking moiety, as is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> What is important is that the metal ion complex, comprising the metal ion, the chelator and the therapeutic blocking moiety, is not readily able to rapidly exchange water molecules when the therapeutic moeities are in the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion, such that in the presence of the therapeutic blocking moiety, there is less or little substantial image enhancement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the physiological target protein is an enzyme. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the possible enzyme target substances are quite broad. Suitable classes of enzymes include, but are not limited to, hydrolases such as proteases, carbohydrases, lipases and nucleases; isomerases such as racemases, epimerases, tautomerases, or mutases; transferases, kinases and phophatases. Enzymes associated with the generation or maintenance of arterioschlerotic plaques and lesions within the circulatory system, inflammation, wounds, immune response, tumors, apoptosis, exocytosis, etc. may all be treated using the present invention. Enzymes such as lactase, maltase, sucrase or invertase, cellulase, &agr;-amylase, aldolases, glycogen phosphorylase, kinases such as hexokinase, proteases such as serine, cysteine, aspartyl and metalloproteases may also be detected, including, but not limited to, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and other therapeutically relevant serine proteases such as tPA and the other proteases of the thrombolytic cascade; cysteine proteases including: the cathepsins, including cathepsin B, L, S, H, J, N and O; and calpain; and caspases, such as caspase-3, -5, -8 and other caspases of the apoptotic pathway, such as interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE). Similarly, bacterial and viral infections may be detected via characteristic bacterial and viral enzymes. As will be appreciated in the art, this list is not meant to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Once the target enzyme is identified or chosen, enzyme inhibitor therapeutically active agents can be designed using well known parameters of enzyme substrate specificities. As described above, the inhibitor may be another metal ion complex such as the cobalt complexes described above. Other suitable enzyme inhibitors include, but are not limited to, the cysteine protease inhibitors described in PCT US95/02252, PCT/US96/03844 and PCT/US96/08559, and known protease inhibitors that are used as drugs such as inhibitors of HIV proteases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the therapeutically active agent is a nucleic acid, for example to do gene therapy or antisense therapy. By &ldquo;nucleic acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;oligonucleotide&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. A nucleic acid of the present invention will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, as described below, nucleic acid analogs are included that may have alternate backbones, comprising, for example, phosphoramide (Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron 49(10):1925 (1993) and references therein; Letsinger, J. Org. Chem. 35:3800 (1970); Sprinzl et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 81:579 (1977); Letsinger et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 14:3487 (1986); Sawai et al, Chem. Lett. 805 (1984), Letsingeret al., J. Am. Chem.

No. 5,644,048), phosphorodithioate (Briu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:2321 (1989), O-methylphophoroamidite linkages (see Eckstein, Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press), and peptide nucleic acid backbones and linkages (see Egholm, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:1895 (1992); Meier et al., Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 31:1008 (1992); Nielsen, Nature, 365:566 (1993); Carlsson et al., Nature 380:207 (1996), all of which are incorporated by reference). Other analog nucleic acids include those with positive backbones (Denpcy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:6097 (1995); non-ionic backbones (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,386,023, 5,637,684, 5,602,240, 5,216,141 and 4,469,863; Kiedrowshi et al., Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. English 30:423 (1991); Letsinger et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110:4470 (1988); Letsinger et al., Nucleoside &amp; Nucleotide 13:1597 (1994); Chapters 2 and 3, ASC Symposium Series 580, &ldquo;Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research&rdquo;, Ed. Y. S. Sanghui and P. Dan Cook; Mesmaeker et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chem. Lett. 4:395 (1994); Jeffs et al., J. Biomolecular NMR 34:17 (1994); Tetrahedron Lett. 37:743 (1996)) and non-ribose backbones, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,235,033 and 5,034,506, and Chapters 6 and 7, ASC Symposium Series 580, &ldquo;Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research&rdquo;, Ed. Y. S. Sanghui and P. Dan Cook. Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins et al., Chem. Soc. Rev. (1995) pp 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C &amp; E News Jun. 2, 1997 page 35. All of these references are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments; for example, PNA antisense embodiments are particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those in the art, all of these nucleic acid analogs may find use in the present invention. In addition, mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made or mixtures of different nucleic acid analogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid may be single-stranded or double stranded. The physiological target molecule can be a substantially complementary nucleic acid or a nucleic acid binding moiety, such as a protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the physiological target substance is a physiologically active ion, and the therapeutically active agent is an ion binding ligand or chelate. For example, toxic metal ions could be chelated to decrease toxicity, using a wide variety of known chelators including, for example, crown ethers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In addition to the therapeutically active agents and coordination site barriers, a therapeutic blocking moiety may also comprise a cleavage site or cleavable linkage. As described herein, one way of delivering the therapeutically active agent is to cleave it off the MRI contrast agent. It is also possible to configure the MRI contrast agents of the invention such that a coordination site barrier is cleaved off, leaving the therapeutically active agent attached to the MRI contrast agent, but in a conformation wherein the drug is now able to interact with its target in a way it was not able to prior to cleavage. In some embodiments, the coordination atom(s) that hinder the rapid exchange of water at a coordination site may be contributed by the cleavage site. Thus for example, when a proteolytic cleavage site is used, coordination atoms may be provided by an atom of the peptide chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the physiological target is an enzyme and the cleavage site corresponds to that enzyme. Alternatively, the cleavage site is unrelated to the physiological target. In this embodiment, the cleavage site may be either specific to a disease condition, for example the cleavage site may be an HIV protease site and the therapeutically active agent is chosen to interfere with a different viral function (for example viral replication), or it may be non-specific, relying instead on a different mechanism for specificity, if desired. For example, the cleavage site may be a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; intracellular protease site, and specificity can be provided by a targeting moiety attached to the MRI contrast agent; for example, a cell-specific ligand could be used to target a specific set of cells such as tumor cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, a proteolytic cleavage site may be used for cleavage by proteases. The cleavage site thus comprises a peptide or polypeptide that is capable of being cleaved by a defined protease. By &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; or &ldquo;polypeptide&rdquo; herein is meant a compound of about 2 to about 15 amino acid residues covalently linked by peptide bonds. Preferred embodiments utilize polypeptides from about 2 to about 8 amino acids, with about 2 to about 4 being the most preferred. Preferably, the amino acids are naturally occurring amino acids, although amino acid analogs and peptidomimitic structures are also useful. Under certain circumstances, the peptide may be only a single amino acid residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Preferred protease cleavage sites and cognate proteases include, but are not limited to, prosequences of retroviral proteases including human immunodeficiency virus protease, and sequences recognized and cleaved by trypsin (EP 578472), Takasuga, A. et al. (1992) J. Biochem. 112: 652-57), proteases encoded by Picornaviruses (Ryan, M. D. et al. (1997) J. Gen. Virol. 78: 699-723), factor X<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>(Gardella, T.

<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when the enzyme is a carbohydrase, the cleavage site will be a carbohydrate group which is capable of being cleaved by the target carbohydrase. For example, when the enzyme is lactase or &bgr;-galactosidase, the cleavage site is lactose or galactose. Similar pairs include sucrase/sucrose, maltase/maltose, and &agr;-amylase/amylose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the cleavage site is a phosphorus moiety, as defined above, such as &mdash;(OPO(OR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>))<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 10, with from 1 to 5 being preferred and 1 to 3 being particularly preferred. Each R is independently hydrogen or a substitution group as defined herein, with hydrogen being preferred. This embodiment is particularly useful when the cleavage enzyme is alkaline phosphatase or a phosphodiesterase, or other enzymes known to cleave phosphorus containing moieties such as these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In addition to the components described above, it should be appreciated that the therapeutic blocking moieties of the present invention may further comprise a linker group as well as a functional therapeutic blocking moiety. Again, as described herein for the therapeutically active agents and the cleavage sites, a coordination atom may actually be provided by the linker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the therapeutic blocking moieties of the invention include a therapeutically active agent and optional cleavage sites, coordination site barriers, and linkers, if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the metal ion complexes of the invention have a single associated or bound therapeutic blocking moiety. In such embodiments, the single therapeutic blocking moiety impedes the exchange of water molecules in at least one coordination site. Alternatively, as is described below, a single therapeutic blocking moiety may hinder the exchange of water molecules in more than one coordination site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, two or more therapeutic blocking moieties are associated with a single metal ion complex, to implede the exchange of water in at least one or more coordination sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The therapeutic blocking moiety is attached to the metal ion complex in a variety of ways. In a preferred embodiment, as noted above, the therapeutic blocking moiety is attached to the metal ion complex via a linker group. Alternatively, the therapeutic blocking moiety is attached directly to the metal ion complex; for example, as described below, the therapeutic blocking moiety may be a substituent group on the chelator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment at least one of the R groups attached to the &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of the chelator, for example R<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, or R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>of the DOTA structures, or R<highlight><subscript>13</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>17</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>or R<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>of the DTPA structures, comprises an alkyl (including substituted and heteroalkyl groups), or aryl (including substituted and heteroaryl groups), i.e. is a group sterically bulkier than hydrogen. This is particular useful to drive the equilibrium towards &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the coordination atom of the arm into place to prevent water exchange, as is known for standard MRI contrast agents. Preferred groups include the C1 through C6 alkyl groups with methyl being particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> This is particularly preferred when the therapeutic blocking moiety is attached via one of the &ldquo;arms&rdquo;, for example when a therapeutic blocking moiety is at position X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to X<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(Structure 20), or position H, I, J or K of Structure 21. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> However the inclusion of too many groups may drive the equilibrium in the other direction effectively locking the coordination atom out of position. Therefore in a preferred embodiment only 1 or 2 of these positions is a non-hydrogen group, unless other methods are used to drive the equilibrium towards binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The therapeutic blocking moieties are chosen and designed using a variety of parameters. In the embodiment which uses a coordination site barrier and the coordination site barrier is fastened or secured on two sides, the affinity of the coordination site barrier of the therapeutic blocking moiety for the metal ion complex need not be great, since it is tethered in place. That is, in this embodiment, the complex is &ldquo;off&rdquo; in the absence of the cleavage agent. However, in the embodiment where the therapeutic blocking moiety is linked to the complex in such a manner as to allow some rotation or flexibility of the therapeutic blocking moiety, for example, it is linked on one side only, the therapeutic blocking moiety should be designed such that it occupies the coordination site a majority of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> When the therapeutic blocking moiety is not covalently tethered on two sides, it should be understood that the components of the therapeutic blocking moieties are chosen to maximize three basic interactions that allow the therapeutic blocking moiety to be sufficiently associated with the complex to hinder the rapid exchange of water in at least one coordination site of the complex. First, there may be electrostatic interactions between the therapeutic blocking moiety and the metal ion, to allow the therapeutic blocking moiety to associate with the complex. Secondly, there may be Van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions. Thirdly, there may be ligand interactions, that is, one or more functionalities of the therapeutic blocking moiety may serve as coordination atoms for the metal. In addition, linker groups may be chosen to force or favor certain conformations, to drive the equilibrium towards an associated therapeutic blocking moiety. Similarly, removing degrees of freedom in the molecule may force a particular conformation to prevail. Thus, for example, the addition of alkyl groups, and particularly methyl groups, at positions equivalent to the R<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>to R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>positions of structure 20 when the therapeutic blocking moiety is attached at an &ldquo;X&rdquo; position can lead the therapeutic blocking moiety to favor the blocking position. Similar restrictions can be made in the other embodiments, as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, effective &ldquo;tethering&rdquo; of the therapeutic blocking moiety down over the metal ion may also be done by engineering in other non-covalent interactions that will serve to increase the affinity of the therapeutic blocking moiety to the chelator complex, as is depicted below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Potential therapeutic blocking moieties may be easily tested to see if they are functional; that is, if they sufficiently occupy or block the appropriate coordination site or sites of the complex to prevent rapid exchange of water. Thus, for example, complexes are made with potential therapeutic blocking moieties and then compared with the chelator without the therapeutic blocking moiety in imaging experiments. Once it is shown that the therapeutic blocking moiety is a sufficient &ldquo;blocker&rdquo;, the experiments are repeated in the presence of either the physiological target (when it is the interaction of the target and the drug which causes either cleavage or a conformational change resulting in opening up of a coordination site) or the cleavage agent, to show an increase in the exchange of water and thus enhancement of the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Thus, as described above, the metal ion complexes of the present invention comprise a paramagnetic metal ion bound to a chelator and at least one therapeutic blocking moiety. In a preferrred embodiment, the metal ion complexes have the formula shown in Structure 20:

<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In Structure 20, M is a paramagnetic metal ion selected from the group consisting of Gd(III), Fe(III), Mn(II), Yt(III), and Dy(III). A, B, C and D are each either single or double bonds. The R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>groups are substitution groups as defined above, including therapeutic blocking moieties and targeting moieties. X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through X<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are &mdash;OH, &mdash;COO&mdash;, &mdash;(CH2)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>OH (with &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OH being preferred), &mdash;(CH2)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>COO&mdash;(with CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>COO&mdash; being preferred), or a substitution group, including therapeutic blocking moieties and targeting moieties. n is from 1 to 10, with from 1 to 5 being preferred.

<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In the Structures depicted herein, any or all of A, B, C or D may be a single bond or a double bond. It is to be understood that when one or more of these bonds are double bonds, there may be only a single substitutent group attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, when A is a double bond, there may be only a single R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a single R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>group attached to the respective carbons; in a preferred embodiment, as described below, the R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups are hydrogen. In a preferred embodiment, A is a single bond, and it is possible to have two R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>groups and two R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups on the respective carbons. In a preferred embodiment, these groups are all hydrogen with the exception of a single therapeutic blocking moiety, but alternate embodiments utilize two R groups which may be the same or different. That is, there may be a hydrogen and a therapeutic group attached in the R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>position, and two hydrogens, two alkyl groups, or a hydrogen and an alkyl group in the R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the exact composition of the X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-X<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>groups will depend on the presence of the metal ion. That is, in the absence of the metal ion, the groups may be &mdash;OH, &mdash;COOH, &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>OH, or (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>COOH; however, when the metal is present, the groups may be &mdash;OH, &mdash;COO&mdash;, &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>O&mdash;, or (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>COO&mdash;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that, as above, the exact composition of the H, I, J, K and L groups will depend on the presence of the metal ion. That is, in the absence of the metal ion, H, I, J, K and L are &mdash;OH, &mdash;COOH, &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>OH, or (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>COOH; however, when the metal is present, the groups are &mdash;OH, &mdash;COO&mdash;, &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>OH, or (CH2)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>COO&mdash;. </paragraph>

In a preferred embodiment, R<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>to R<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>are hydrogen. At least one of R<highlight><subscript>13</subscript></highlight>-R<highlight><subscript>21</subscript></highlight>, H, I, J, K or L is a therapeutic blocking moiety, as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In addition, the complexes and metal ion complexes of the invention may further comprise one or more targeting moieties. That is, a targeting moiety may be attached at any of the R positions (or to a linker or therapeutic blocking moiety, etc.), although in a preferred embodiment the targeting moiety does not replace a coordination atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the metal ion complexes of the present invention are water soluble or soluble in aqueous solution. By &ldquo;soluble in aqueous solution&rdquo; herein is meant that the MRI contrast agent has appreciable solubility in aqueous solution and other physiological buffers and solutions. Solubility may be measured in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, solubility is measured using the United States Pharmacopeia solubility classifications, with the metal ion complex being either very soluble (requiring less than one part of solvent for 1 part of solute), freely soluble (requiring one to ten parts solvent per 1 part solute), soluble (requiring ten to thirty parts solvent per 1 part solute), sparingly soluble (requiring 30 to 100 parts solvent per 1 part solute), or slightly soluble (requiring 100-1000 parts solvent per 1 part solute). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Testing whether a particular metal ion complex is soluble in aqueous solution is routine, as will be appreciated by those in the art. For example, the parts of solvent required to solubilize a single part of MRI contrast agent may be measured, or solubility in gm/mi may be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention are generally synthesized using well known techniques. See, for example, Moi et al., supra; Tsien et al., supra; Borch et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., p2987 (1971); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Alexander, (1995), supra; Jackels (1990), supra, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,215, 5,087,440, 5,219,553, 5,188,816, 4,885,363, 5,358,704, 5,262,532; Meyer et al., (1990), supra, Moi et al., (1988), and McMurray et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 3(2):108-117 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> For DOTA derivatives, the synthesis depends on whether nitrogen substitution or carbon substitution of the cyclen ring backbone is desired. For nitrogen substitution, such as is exemplified by the galactose-DOTA structures of the examples, the synthesis begins with cyclen or cyclen derivatives, as is well known in the art; see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,885,363 and 5,358,704. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> For carbon substitution, such as is exemplified by the BAPTA-DOTA structures of the examples, well known techniques are used. See for example Moi et al., supra, and Gansow, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> The contrast agents of the invention are complexed with the appropriate metal ion as is known in the art. While the structures depicted herein all comprise a metal ion, it is to be understood that the contrast agents of the invention need not have a metal ion present initially. Metal ions can be added to water in the form of an oxide or in the form of a halide and treated with an equimolar amount of a contrast agent composition. The contrast agent may be added as an aqueous solution or suspension. Dilute acid or base can be added if need to maintain a neutral pH. Heating at temperatures as high as 100&deg; C. may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention can be isolated and purified, for example using HPLC systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions comprising pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the contrast agents can also be prepared by using a base to neutralize the complexes while they are still in solution. Some of the complexes are formally uncharged and do not need counterions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In addition, the MRI contrast agents of the invention can be added to polymers, using techniques generally described in PCT US95/14621 and U.S. Ser. No. 08/690,612 (allowed), both of which are expressly incorporated by reference. Briefly, chemical functional groups are added to the MRI contrast agents to allow the chemical attachment of a plurality of MRI contrast agents to polymers. A &ldquo;polymer&rdquo; comprises at least two or three subunits, which are covalently attached. At least some portion of the monomeric subunits contain functional groups for the covalent attachment of the MRI contrast agents. In some embodiments coupling moieties are used to covalently link the subunits with the MRI contrast agents. As will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide variety of polymers are possible. Suitable polymers include functionalized styrenes, such as amino styrene, functionalized dextrans, and polyamino acids. Preferred polymers are polyamino acids (both poly-D-amino acids and poly-L-amino acids), such as polylysine, and polymers containing lysine and other amino acids being particularly preferred. Other suitable polyamino acids are polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers of lysine and glutamic or aspartic acid, co-polymers of lysine with alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, serine, tryptophan, and/or proline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Similarly, it is also possible to create &ldquo;multimers&rdquo; of MRI contrast agents, by either direct attachment or through the use of linkers as is generally described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/690,612 (allowed), incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Once synthesized, the metal ion complexes of the invention have use as magnetic resonance imaging contrast or enhancement agents. Specifically, the functional MRI contrast agents of the invention have several important uses. First, they may be used to diagnose disease states of the brain, as is described below. Second, they may be used in real-time detection and differentiation of myocardial infraction versus ischemia. Third, they may be used in in vivo, i.e. whole organism, investigation of antigens and immunocytochemistry for the location of tumors. Fourth, they may be used in the identification and localization of toxin and drug binding sites. In addition, they may be used to perform rapid screens of the physiological response to drug therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> The metal ion complexes of the invention may be used in a similar manner to the known gadolinium MRI contrast agents. See for example, Meyer et al., supra; U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,215; U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,440; Margerstadt et al., Magn. Reson. Med. 3:808 (1986); Runge et al., Radiology 166:835 (1988); and Bousquet et al., Radiology 166:693 (1988). The metal ion complexes are administered to a cell, tissue or patient as is known in the art. A &ldquo;patient&rdquo; for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals and organisms, such as experimental animals. Thus the methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In addition, the metal ion complexes of the invention may be used to image tissues or cells; for example, see Aguayo et al., Nature 322:190 (1986). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Generally, sterile aqueous solutions of the contrast agent complexes of the invention are administered to a patient in a variety of ways, including orally, intrathecally and especially intraveneously in concentrations of 0.003 to 1.0 molar, with dosages from 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 millimoles per kilogram of body weight being preferred. Dosages may depend on the structures to be imaged. Suitable dosage levels for similar complexes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,885,363 and 5,358,704. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> In addition, the contrast agents of the invention may be delivered via specialized delivery systems, for example, within liposomes (see Navon, Magn. Reson. Med. 3:876-880 (1986)) or microspheres, which may be selectively taken up by different organs (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,215). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the blood clearance times (or half-life) of the MRI contrast agents of the invention. This has been done, for example, by adding carbohydrate polymers to the chelator (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,215). Thus, one embodiment utilizes polysaccharides as substitution R groups on the compositions of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment utilizes complexes which cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, as is known in the art, a DOTA derivative which has one of the carboxylic acids replaced by an alcohol to form a neutral DOTA derivative has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, for example, neutral complexes are designed that cross the blood-brain barrier with blocking moieties which detect Ca&plus;2 ions. These compounds are used in MRI of a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzeheimer&apos;s disease. Currently it is difficult to correctly diagnosis Alzeheimer&apos;s disease, and it would be useful to be able to have a physiological basis to distinguish Alzeheimer&apos;s disease from depression, or other treatable clinical symptoms for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic moiety is attached to the chelate using a photocleavable moiety as defined on the next page. Also included in the photocleavable moieties are guinone derivatives. Also included are WO99/25389, PCT US/9822743, hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> In the imaging moieties of the present invention, the cleavable linkage that links an MRI contrast agent to the polymer can be any of the cleavage linkages, cleavable linkers, or cleavable sites described herein, for example, an enzyme cleavage site. In preferred embodiments, the cleavable linkage is a protease cleavage site or an ester linkage as described herein. The cleavable linkage may be attached to the MRI contrast agent and polymer using methods described herein or known in the art. </paragraph>
