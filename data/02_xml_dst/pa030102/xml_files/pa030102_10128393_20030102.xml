<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor memory devices and, in particular, to semiconductor memory devices and a method for testing the same. The method can optimize operation conditions by detecting a test cell that may easily fail in a test among memory cells passing a burn-in test, and detecting the worst operation conditions by performing the test on the test cell, thereby reducing power consumption in a refresh or active operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, semiconductor device tests may be classified as either product tests or as a proof tests. The product test detects a defect generated in a fabrication process such as a wafer process and an assembly process. Through the product test, it is possible to screen out the defective products to select the good products. For this reason, the product test is performed in a shipping (fabrication) process in great quantity, and requires a high throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The proof test confirms whether functionality and performance of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) satisfies requisite specifications. In research and development, the proof test is precisely executed to improve the quality of the products and to reduce a development period. During the proof test, when a fabrication defect is detected, or when the function of the products do not satisfy relevant specifications, an analysis, or failure analysis, is executed to examine failure causes. It is especially important to locate a position in the DRAM in which a defect is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The DRAM test measures characteristics such as direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) parameters and functionality, using a memory tester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To detect an initial DRAM defects at an early stage, a burn-in test, which is performed as a function test, applies a higher voltage and temperature than the DRAM will experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The defect cells detected in the product and proof tests are repaired using redundancy cells to perform a normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The DRAM is operated using the passed cells under the operation conditions considered requisite for normal DRAM operation, which are selected on the basis of experimental data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described above, the DRAM should be designed to have a sufficient operation margin, so that it can be operated in the worst conditions. If the sufficient operation margin is not obtained, a number of defect cells can be detected, and thus a usable chip may be detected as a defect chip, which results in low production yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, to solve the foregoing problem, a method of shortening a refresh period has been suggested to obtain a sufficient margin. However, according to this method, power consumption is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the margin is sufficiently set up in the operation conditions, operation speed of the DRAM decreases. In order to prevent reduction of the operation speed of the DRAM, a high voltage can be applied. However, the use of high voltage also causes high power consumption. For example, the operation speed of a DRAM is increased merely by setting up a sense amplifier driving voltage as a high voltage, which results in increased power consumption. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The disclosed semiconductor memory device may include a memory cell array, a test unit and a driving unit. The memory cell array may comprise a test cell determined to be a worst cell one among memory cells passing a first test. The test unit performs a second test on the test cell under predetermined operation conditions, repeatedly performing the second test after adjusting the operation conditions of the test cell according to the result of the second test and finally outputting the final operation conditions. The driving unit drives the memory cell array using the final operation conditions obtained from the test unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, a method for testing a semiconductor memory device is disclosed. The method may include detecting a test cell that may easily fail among the cells passing a first test, repairing the test cell, and memorizing an address of the test cell. The method may also include a test step for performing a second test on the test cell in predetermined operation conditions by using the address of the test cell and returning to the test step after adjusting the operation conditions, when the test cell passes the second test. The method may also include providing the operating conditions used in the test step as driving conditions of a memory cell array, when the test cell fails in the second test.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor memory device includes a memory cell array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including a test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is determined as a worst one among the cells passing a burn-in test. The semiconductor memory device also includes a test unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for testing the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputting the operation conditions as a testing product, as well as a driving unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for driving the memory cell array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the operation conditions from the test unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The test unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for delaying the data DOUT stored in the test cell for a predetermined time and a data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for comparing the delayed data DOUTD with a test data TD, and outputting the comparing result signal PFD. The test unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> also includes an operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for controlling the operation conditions according to the comparing result signal PFD and a test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for controlling a test operation for storing and reading the test data TD in/from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using the operation conditions from the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the worst cell among the cells passing in the burn-in test. For a normal operation, the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is repaired by a synchronous RAM-type repair cell by using an anti-fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Here, an address of the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is marked so that a succeeding test can be executed not on the repaired cell, but on the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the address of the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored in the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> stores the test data TD into the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> reads the data from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> executes the test in response to the test command TCMD. However, when the current test condition is a test for controlling a refresh period, the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can automatically execute the test without regard for the test command TCMD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The operation of the disclosed semiconductor memory device is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The burn-in test is performed, and the failed cells are repaired by using the anti-fuse (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which may easily fail among the passed cells in the burn-in test, is detected and repaired by using the anti-fuse (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Here, the address of the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is marked (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The reason the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is marked is so that a succeeding test may be performed on the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, not the repair cell corresponding to the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An input of the test command TCMD is confirmed (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). If the test command TCMD is inputted, the test is executed on the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the current operation conditions (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the test result is confirmed (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes the test, the operation conditions are adjusted (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). The test is then performed again under the adjusted operation conditions (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The test result is confirmed (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fails in the test, the final operation conditions are outputted, and the normal operation is performed according to the final operation conditions (S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a detailed circuit diagram illustrating the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the test circuit of the semiconductor memory device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of NAND gates ND<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-NDN, each having one input terminals connected to receive control signals D<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-DN, and each having the other input terminals connected to receive the data (DOUT) read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The NAND gates control a delay rate according to the control signals D<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-DN. The delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of unit delays DE<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-DEN, which are controlled according to output signals from the NAND gates ND<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-NDN, for delaying output signals from the preceding unit delays for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The unit delay DEi includes a NAND gate NDDi having one input terminal connected to receive an output signal from the preceding unit delay DEi-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the other input terminal connected to receive an output signal from a NAND gate NDi. The unit delay DEi also includes an inverter INVi for inverting an output signal from the NAND gate NDDi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delayed using the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When a failure occurs because the data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not identical to the test data TD, the test conditions are applied to the other cells connected to the identical word line of the test cell. As a result, in order to generate a non-failure state due to the failure, the data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delayed for a predetermined time, thereby obtaining a margin of failure generation conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a detailed block diagram illustrating the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor memory device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes a latch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for latching the data DOUTD delayed by the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and outputting a data TSTD latched according to a clock signal CLKT, a latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for latching the test data TD and outputting a data REFD latched according to a clock signal CLKW and an exclusive OR gate XOR for comparing the data TSTD and REFD from the latches <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and outputting the comparison result signal PFD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In detail, the latch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> latches the data DOUTD obtained by delaying the data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and outputs the latched data TSTD synchronized with the clock signal CLKT pursuant to the test operation period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> latches the test data TD stored in the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and outputs the latched data REFD in synchronization with the clock signal CLKW in accordance with a time of enabling the word line connected to the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to write the test data TD in the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The exclusive OR gate XOR compares the data TSTD and REFD from the two latches <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the data are identical, the exclusive OR gate has a pass result, and outputs a low level comparison result signal PFD. When the data are different, the exclusive OR gate has a failure result, and outputs a high level comparison result signal PFD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the current test condition is a refresh period test, when the test result is passed by the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> controls a parameter tREF so that the refresh period can be increased longer than the refresh period of the test. When the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates that the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> does not control the refresh period, but outputs the refresh period of the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the current test condition is a test for controlling an enable speed of a sense amplifier, and the test result is passed by the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> delays the enable speed of the sense amplifier so that the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can perform the test again. When the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates that the test result is failed, the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> does not control the enable speed of the sense amplifier, but outputs the enable speed of the sense amplifier of the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the current test condition is a test for controlling the refresh period and the enable speed of the sense amplifier. When the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates that the test result is passed, the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> adjusts a refresh-related parameter to control the refresh period, controls the enable speed of the sense amplifier, and executes the test again. When the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> indicates that the test result is failed, the operation condition controller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> outputs the refresh period and the enable speed of the sense amplifier of the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although the comparison result signal PFD of the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shows failure, the data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delayed by the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and thus the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is passed in the current test conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the latch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> latches the data DOUTD delayed by the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and outputs the data TSTD latched according to the clock signal CLKT. The latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> latches the test data TD, and compares the test data TD with the latched data REFD outputted according to the clock signal CLKW. The data REFD latched by the latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a high level, and the data TSTD latched by the latch <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has a low level, thus generating failure. However, since the data DOUT read from the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a high level, it is passed in the current operation conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Here, a delay rate D of the delay <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is optionally set up by adjusting the control signals D<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-DN. Although the test cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is actually passed in the data comparator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it has a margin detected as failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one example of the semiconductor memory device, when the operation condition relates to the refresh period, the test is executed regardless of the test command TCMD (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). When the test result is &lsquo;pass,&rsquo; the test is re-performed with a reduced refresh period (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). When the test result is &lsquo;failure,&rsquo; the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> does not perform the test, but outputs the refresh period of the test to the driving unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). The driving unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> performs the refresh operation by employing the inputted refresh period from the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In another example of the semiconductor memory device, when the operation condition relates to the enable speed of the sense amplifier, the test is executed according to input of the test command TCMD (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). When the test result is &lsquo;pass,&rsquo; the test is re-performed by delaying the enable speed of the sense amplifier (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). When the test result is &lsquo;failure,&rsquo; the test controller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> does not perform the test, but outputs the enable speed of the sense amplifier of the test to the driving unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Then, the driving unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> performs the normal operation such as a read or write operation employing the inputted enable speed of the sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In addition, in a situation in which the operation conditions is to control the refresh speed and the enable speed of the sense amplifier, the test is executed (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). When the test result is &lsquo;pass,&rsquo; the test is performed by reducing the refresh period (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), and the test is performed by delaying the enable speed of the sense amplifier (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), thereby optimizing the refresh period and the enable speed of the sense amplifier.
