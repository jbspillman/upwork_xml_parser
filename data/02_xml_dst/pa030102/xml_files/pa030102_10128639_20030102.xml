</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The MPEG4 standard is notably described in the document ISO/IEC 14496-1, entitled &ldquo;Information Technology&mdash;Very Low Bit Rate Audiovisual Coding&mdash;part 1: Systems&rdquo; published by ISO in 1999. This standard particularly describes a binary scene format BIFS having for its object to describe spatiotemporal relations between various graphic objects of a scene. Information which is necessary for composing a scene constitutes a scene description. A concept of a scene description is given in section 9 of this standard. A scene description has a tree structure composed of nodes, each node corresponding to an object and comprising a set of fields. Routes are used to assign the value of one field to another field. A data stream in BIFS format comprises two types of data, scene descriptions and commands. The commands may be of two types: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> commands for replacing the scene, comprising a whole scene description, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> commands for modifying the scene, comprising modifications to be applied to a scene description, like a replacement of one node by another, an addition or a suppression of a node, a modification of a field or of a route. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A scene description is generally written by an author by using a user-friendly format, for example, a text format. The commands are generally written in the same format. This format will hereinafter be referred to as BIFS text format. However, for a transport of a data stream in the BIFS format, it is necessary to convert the BIFS text format into a binary format, which will hereinafter be referred to as BIFS binary format. Such a conversion allows simultaneous transportation of a very large quantity of information. The BIFS binary format as well as the conversion from the BIFS text format into the BIFS binary format has been described in the above-cited standard. This standard describes how the scene descriptions must be converted and how the commands must be converted from the BIFS text format into the BIFS binary format. However, the above-cited standard does not describe any device for converting the BIFS text format into the BIFS binary format. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide a device with which a BIFS text format can be converted into a BIFS binary format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a data-processing device as defined in the opening paragraph is characterized in that it comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> a scene transcoder for converting the scene description from the first format into the second format, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a command transcoder for converting the command from the first format into the second format and having access to information comprised in the scene transcoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a data-processing method as defined in the opening paragraph is characterized in that it comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> transcoding the scene for converting the scene description from the first format into the second format, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> transcoding commands for converting the command from the first format into the second format by means of information elaborated during the scene transcoding step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a BIFS text data stream is converted into a BIFS binary data stream in the following manner. The data relating to the scene description are converted by the scene transcoder as described in the above-cited standard, and the data relating to the commands are separately converted by the command transcoder as described in the above-cited standard. However, to be able to convert the data relating to the commands, the command transcoder must have access to information which is present in the scene transcoder, such as names and identifiers of nodes. Indeed, each node of the scene description has a name and an identifier. The name is a text which allows identification of a node in a user-friendly manner. The identifier is a number which indicates a location of a node in the scene description. Only the identifier of a node is converted into the BIFS binary format. The commands in the BIFS text format only comprise the names of the nodes. Consequently, the command transcoder needs a table of correspondence between the names and the identifiers of the nodes, which table is comprised in the scene transcoder. Consequently, when a command modifies the scene description, it is not necessary to again convert the whole scene description from the BIFS text format into the BIFS binary format, but only the command. The conversion is thus more rapid, which may be advantageous in applications that are subject to real-time constraints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, a data-processing device as described above is characterized in that it comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a graphic interface; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> a compositor suitable for supplying an audiovisual representation of the scene description on the graphic interface; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> modification means connected to said graphic interface and being suitable for effecting at least a modification of said audiovisual representation, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> editing means suitable for generating at least a command in the first format, said command being representative of the modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This embodiment allows an author to modify a scene description in a user-friendly manner. Indeed, by virtue of the compositor and the graphic interface, the author has at any instant an audiovisual representation of the scene description which he wishes to modify. Using a mouse, a keyboard or any other modification means connected to the graphic interface, he modifies this audiovisual representation as he wishes. Editing means allow commands in the BIFS text format to be generated on the basis of the modifications effected by the author. Such editing means are known to those skilled in the art by the term of authoring tool. Moreover, this embodiment allows use of dynamic commands, i.e. commands generating a modification of the scene description which does not take immediate effect, while conserving its user-friendly aspect. For example, it is possible to carry out a command intended to generate the modification of a node at a given future instant. When one is satisfied with converting the scene description into the BIFS binary format at the instant when the command is carried out, this command would not be taken into account because the modification would only take effect at a future instant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In so far as the steps described above can be performed by means of software, the invention also provides a program comprising program code instructions for performing the steps of the method described above when said program is executed on a processor. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates characteristic features of the invention. A data-processing device according to the invention comprises a scene transcoder <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprising a decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and an encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a multiplexer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Data in a first format <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> contain a scene description <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and commands <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>; they are converted into data of a second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> by means of the data-processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the example under consideration, the first format is a BIFS text format and the second format is a BIFS binary format. The scene description in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which constructs a scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in the sense of the standard described above. This scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> notably comprises a tree structure having nodes. The decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> allocates an identifier to each node stored in a node coding table for each node. Based on the information comprised in all the node coding tables, the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> establishes a table of correspondence <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> between the names and the identifiers of the nodes. The encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> converts this scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so as to generate a scene description in the BIFS binary format <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The commands in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are converted into commands in the BIFS binary format <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> by the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As a command may consist of, for example, a modification of a node of the scene description <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has access to the table of correspondence <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> between the names and the identifiers of the nodes. This correspondence table <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is stored, for example, in the form of a file in the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>; the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> opens this file in order to access the required information. Indeed, the above-cited standard indicates that only the identifier of a node must be converted into the BIFS binary format. As the commands in the BIFS text format only comprise the names of the nodes to be modified, it is necessary for the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to have access to the identifiers of the corresponding nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The multiplexer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> regroups the scene description in the BIFS binary format <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the commands in the BIFS binary format <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for generating the data in the BIFS binary format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. An example of the scene description in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> will be given below:

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This scene description in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> describes a white circle (referred to as circle G1) having a radius of 20 pixels. An example of a command in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> will be given below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> AT 10000 REPLACE NODE G1 BY Rectangle &lcub;size 10 20&rcub;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This command in the BIFS text format <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> signifies that, at a certain instant, the circle G1 is replaced by a rectangle having dimensions of 10 by 20 pixels. In this example, this instant occurs 10 seconds after the start of visualizing an audiovisual representation of the scene description <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A user can effect such a visualization on a graphic interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate two examples of data-processing devices in accordance with the prior art, allowing a conversion of data from a first format into a second format. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the data in the first format <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are converted into data in the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> by means of a transcoder <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The transcoder <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> converts the scene descriptions as well as the commands from the first format into the second format. Such a transcoder <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is described in the document &ldquo;ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11&mdash;title: BIFS/OD Encoder version 4.0&mdash;author: Zvi Lifshitz&rdquo; published in November 1999. A drawback of such a data-processing device is that it is not user-friendly. Indeed, such a device does not allow visualization of an audiovisual representation described by the data in the first format <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. With such a device it is thus difficult for an author to modify the scene description with the aid of a mouse or a keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the data in the first format <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which constructs the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be connected to a compositor and a graphic interface (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), allowing an audiovisual representation of the scene description comprised in the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The graphic interface may also be connected to means for modifying and means for editing commands (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), allowing an author to modify the audiovisual representation with the aid of, for example, a mouse or a keyboard. The scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is then modified. This scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is subsequently converted into the second format by the encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which generates the data in the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. Such a device is described in a document published by CSELT on Dec. 20, 1999, entitled &ldquo;IM-1 Two-Dimensional Compositor&rdquo;. A drawback of such a data-processing device is that dynamic commands cannot be effected. Indeed, as the encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> converts the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, only the information present in this scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during such a conversion will be taken into account. If one reverts to the preceding example of the circle G1 which is transformed into a rectangle at a certain instant, when the conversion effected by the encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> precedes the instant at which the modification generated by the command <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> takes effect, it is the circle which is taken into account, and when this conversion follows this instant, it is the rectangle which is taken into account. In order that a modification of the audiovisual representation described by the data in the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> effectively takes place at the instant when it must take place, it is necessary to convert the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> immediately after this instant. This generates a larger quantity of data to be transmitted, hence a relatively low data-transmission speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The invention mitigates these drawbacks as is shown in a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a data-processing device in accordance with a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention. In addition to the elements described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, such a data-processing device comprises a compositor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a graphic interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, modification means <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and editing means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> suitable for generating modification commands in the first format <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With the aid of the compositor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, an audiovisual representation of the scene description comprised in the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can be visualized by an author on the graphic interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Using the modification means <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, for example, a mouse or a keyboard, the author can modify this audiovisual representation. The editing means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> provide the possibility of generating modification commands <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> corresponding to the modifications effected by the author. Authoring tools known to those skilled in the art have the functionalities of the compositor <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the modification means <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the editing means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Software such as Photoshop and Adobe Premiere are examples of such authoring tools. The modification commands <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are sent to the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and to the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. With the aid of the modification commands <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the decoder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> updates the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the modifications which the author has effected can be visualized on the graphic interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Such an update of the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on the basis of a command is described in the above-cited standard. This data-processing device allows, on the one hand, modification of a scene graph in a user-friendly manner without having to convert the whole scene graph when a modification is effected, because in this case only the modification command <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> must be converted from the first format into the second format. The quantity of data of the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> transmitted per unit of time is therefore relatively small, which allows relatively high data-transmission speeds. On the other hand, the author may effect dynamic commands with the aid of the modification means <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Indeed, the command transcoder <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may take such dynamic commands into account, which is not the case with the encoder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which just converts the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into the second format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a graphic interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The graphic interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> comprises a visualization zone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, action buttons <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a dynamic command zone <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and a cursor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The visualization zone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> enables an author to obtain an audiovisual representation of the scene graph <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The cursor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> commanded by the modification means <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> allows, for example, selection of an object in the visualization zone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> so as to displace this object. Subsequent to such a modification of the audiovisual representation, the editing means <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> generate a command which is intended to modify placement parameters of the node of the scene description corresponding to this object. The action buttons <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> allow, for example, modification of a color of an object selected with the cursor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The dynamic command zone <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> enables the author to define at which instant a modification generated by a command must take effect. The author may define such an instant, for example, by means of a keyboard and then change dimensions of an object of the visualization zone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Such a change of dimensions will only take effect at the instant defined by the author. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a telecommunication network using at least one data-processing device according to the invention. Such a telecommunication network comprises a data-processing device <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> transmission medium <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and a reception terminal <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The data in the first format <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may be stored, for example, on a data carrier. As has been described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, they may be modified by an author with the aid of the data-processing device <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> which generates the data in the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. These data <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are transported by the transmission medium <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to the reception terminal <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The transmission medium <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be a transmission medium used for a telecommunication network, such as Internet, for example, Ethernet. The reception terminal <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example, a central computer unit and a computer screen or a set top box and a television screen. It comprises means for visualizing the data in the second format <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, for example, a compositor. Such a reception terminal is known to those skilled in the art. Such a telecommunication network thus particularly enables an author to send audiovisual data to a user having a reception terminal <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and to modify these data in a user-friendly manner and in real time. For example, in a scene description, one of the nodes may correspond to audiovisual information issued from a camera filming a sports event, and another node may correspond to a score. As a function of the evolution of the sports event, the author may modify the score by modifying the contents of the corresponding node. The user will thus be permanently informed of the score of the event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The above description with reference to the Figures illustrates rather than limits the invention. In this respect, several remarks will be made below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The description of the Figures applies to the example of the BIFS format. It should be noted that the invention is also applicable to other formats, which may be more advanced than the BIFS format in so far as these formats apply to scene descriptions and commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> only shows several functionalities of a graphic interface. Such a graphic interface may comprise a large number of functionalities, particularly functionalities corresponding to the commands defined by the format used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In principle, it is possible to implement the method according to the invention by means of a suitably programmed integrated circuit. A set of instructions comprised in a programming memory may cause the integrated circuit to perform the different steps described hereinbefore. The set of instructions may be loaded into the programming memory by reading a data carrier such as, for example, a disc on which the set of instructions has been encoded. Reading may be effected by means of a communication network such as, for example, the Internet. In this case, a service provider puts the set of instructions at the disposal of those interested. </paragraph>
