<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The photosensitive composition of the present invention comprises a photocurable component containing a urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group; a thermosetting resin (C); a photopolymerization initiator (D); and a thermopolymerization catalyst (E); and the above-mentioned photocurable component further contains at least one of (B) a compound having an ethylenically unsaturated group, excluding the component (A), and an epoxy (meth)acrylate compound (F) having a carboxyl group. Therefore, the photosensitive composition is suitable for use as an insulating protective coating film for printed circuit boards. Since the cured film made of the photosensitive composition of the present invention is particularly superior in pliability, curling does not occur even when used for a thin circuit board. Therefore, the cured film is best suited for use in an FPC board. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a photosensitive composition used in insulating protective coating films for printed circuit boards and the like, and cured articles thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A protective film made of polyimide or polyester has widely been used as insulating protective coating films for circuit boards. When this protective film is formed on a circuit board, an adhesive is applied on one surface of the protective film. After perforating the portion which corresponds to a terminal connection when the protective film is formed on the circuit board by means of punching, the protective film and the circuit board are laid one upon the other by hand while positioning them and then are bonded to each other at high temperature under high pressure using a heat plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Polyimide and polyester are suited for protection of wiring because they are pliable to some extent. However, a film must be perforated in advance by means of punching to lead a wiring terminal on the circuit board described above. Therefore, complicated wiring makes it difficult to execute positioning of the film with wiring on the board. Since the cost of the equipment such as a heat plate is high and an adhesive must be used, the cost becomes higher. Also, there was such a problem in that smearing occurs during the punching and oozing of the adhesive occurs during the pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Even if a protective film having excellent heat resistance and electrical insulating properties is used as the insulating protective coating film in such a manner, the performance of the adhesive sometimes exerts an adverse effect on the insulating protective coating film, thus lowering the heat resistance and electrical insulating properties of the insulating protective coating film when the circuit board and the protective film are bonded via the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a method of forming the insulating protective coating film on the circuit board by means of a printing method using cover lay ink (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;cover lay ink method&rdquo;) has recently been studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As an example of cover lay ink, for example, Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 55-145717 discloses a composition comprising an epoxy (meth)acrylate resin and a melamine resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 50-4395 and Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 53-10636 disclose acrylic resin compositions such as sulfomethylene acrylate or phosphoric acid ethylene acrylate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-221172 discloses a composition containing polyaminobismaleimide and an epoxy resin as a principal component, Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 1-121364 discloses a composition containing polyimide as a principal component, and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 1-256515 discloses a composition containing polyparabanic acid and an epoxy resin as a principal component, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, the insulating protective coating film obtained by using the cover lay ink method has poor pliability, heat resistance, and electrical insulating properties, and sometimes has poor adhesion to the circuit board. Therefore, when using the insulating protective coating film in a thin circuit board such as an flexible printed circuit board (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;FPC board&rdquo;), there is a problem in that warp (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;curling&rdquo; sometimes) of the FPC board is caused by a difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the circuit board and the insulating protective coating film and curing shrinkage during the formation of the insulating protective coating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, a coating film made of a composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 55-145717 has the drawback that it has poor pliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Coating films made of compositions disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 50-4395 and Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 53-10636 were noticeably inferior in heat resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Since all compositions disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-221172, Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 1-121364 and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 1-256515 exhibit a large shrinkage factor during curing, severe curling occurs when a cover lay ink coating film is formed on an FPC board by using such a composition, or when the board on which the coating film was formed is subjected to high heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> No material has ever been found which has a beautiful appearance and pliability, is superior in photosensitivity and developability, and also satisfies performance requirements such as heat resistance, electrical insulating properties, and adhesion to the circuit board, and which does not cause curling even when used in a thin circuit board such as an FPC board. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive composition of the present invention contains a photocurable component containing a urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group is a compound containing a unit originating from a (meth)acrylate (a) having a hydroxyl group, a unit originating from a polyol (b) and a unit originating from a polyisocyanate (c) as a constituent unit. In this compound (A), both terminals are composed of the unit originating from the (meth)acrylate (a) having a hydroxyl group, while the moiety between both terminals is composed of the unit originating from a polyol (b) and the unit originating from a polyisocyanate (c). The unit originating from a polyol (b) and the unit originating from a polyisocyanate (c) are bonded through a urethane bond. A repeating unit bonded through this urethane bond has a structure in which a carboxyl group exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> That is, the repeating unit of the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group is represented by &mdash;(OR<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>O&mdash;OCNHR<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>NHCO)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash; &lsqb;wherein OR<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>O represents a dehydration residue of the polyol (b) and R<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>represents a deiocyanate residue of the polyisocyanate (c)&rsqb;. In addition, at least one of R<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>contain a carboxyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group can be prepared by reacting at least a (meth)acrylate (a) having a hydroxyl group, a polyol (b) and a polyisocyanate (c). It is necessary to use a compound having a carboxyl group as the polyol (b) and/or the polyisocyanate. Preferably, a polyol (b) having a carboxyl group is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By using a compound having a carboxyl group as the polyol (b) and/or the polyisocyanate (c), it is made possible to prepare a urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) wherein a carboxyl group exists in R<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>or R<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the above formula, n is preferably from about 1 to 200, and more preferably from 2 to 30. When n is within such a range, the pliability of the cured film made of the photosensitive composition is more superior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When using two or more kinds of at least one of the polyol (b) and/or the polyisocyanate (c), the repeating unit represents plural kinds and the regularity of plural units can be appropriately selected according to the purposes such as completely random repetition, block repetition or localized repetition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Examples of the (meth)acrylate (a) having a hydroxyl group include 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, caprolactone or alkylene oxide adducts of (meth)acrylates described above, glycerin mono(meth)acrylate, glycerin di(meth)acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate-acrylic acid adduct, trimethylolpropane mono(meth)acrylate, trimethylol di(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol penta(meth)acrylate, ditrimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, and trimethylolpropane-alkylene oxide adduct-di(meth)acrylate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> These (meth)acrylates (a) having a hydroxyl group can be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Among these (meth)acrylates (a) having a hydroxyl group, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate are preferred, and 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate is more preferred. When using 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group is synthesized more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The polyol (b) is a compound which constitutes a repeating unit of the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group, along with the polyisocyanate (c). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As the polyol (b), for example, a polymer polyol (b1) and/or a dihydroxyl compound (b2) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Examples of the polymer polyol (b1) used in the present invention include polyether-based diols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polytetramethylene glycol; polyester-based polyols obtained from an ester of a polyhydric alcohol and a polybasic acid; polycarbonate-based diols containing an unit originating from hexamethylene carbonate or pentamethylene carbonate as a constituent unit; and polylactone-based diols such as polycaprolactonediol or polybutyrolactonediol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When using the polymer polyol (b1) having a carboxyl group, it is possible to use a compound synthesized so that a trivalent polybasic acid or a polybasic acid of higher valance such as trimellitic acid (anhydride) is added in the synthesis of the polymer polyol (b1), thus leaving a carboxyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> These polymerpolyols (b1) can be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. When using those having a number-average molecular weight of 200 to 2000 as the polymerpolyl (b1), the pliability of the cured film made of the photosensitive composition is more superior and, therefore, it is preferred. When using polycarbonate-based diols among these polymerpolyols (b1), the cured film made of the photosensitive composition has excellent heat resistance and is also superior in resistance to pressure cooker, and therefore, it is preferred. Furthermore, when the constituent unit of the polymer polyol (b1) is not composed of a single constituent unit, but is composed of plural constituent units, the pliability of the cured film made of the photosensitive composition is more superior and therefore, it is more preferred. Examples of the polymer polyol (b1) composed of plural constituent units include polyether-based diols containing a unit originating from ethylene glycol and propylene glycol; and polycarbonate-based diols containing a unit originating from hexamethylene carbonate and pentamethylene carboante. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As the dihydroxyl compound (b2), a branched or straight-chain compound having two alcoholic hydroxyl groups can be used and an aliphatic dihydroxycarboxylic acid having a carboxyl group is used particularly preferably. Examples of the dihydroxyl compound (b2) include dimethylolpropionic acid and dimethylolbutanoic acid. A carboxyl group can be easily introduced into the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) by using the aliphatic dihydroxycarboxylic acid having a carboxyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> These dihydroxyl compounds (b2) can be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof, and may be used in combination with the polymer polyol (b1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the polymer polyol (b1) having a carboxyl group is used in combination or those having a carboxyl group are used as the polyisocyante (c) described below, a dihydroxyl compound (b2) having no carboxyl group, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, neopentyl glycol, 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol or hydroquinone may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of the polyisocyanate (c) used in the present invention include diisocyanates such as 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethylene diisocyanate, (o, m, or p)-xylene diisocyanate, methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate), trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,3-dimethylene diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4-dimethylene diisocyanate, and 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate. These polyisocyanates can be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A polyisocyanate (c) having a carboxyl group can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group used in the present invention preferably has a number-average molecular weight of 1000 to 40000 and an acid value of 5 to 150 mg KOH/g. The measurement of the acid value was based on JIS K5407. As used herein, the number-average molecular weight is a value in terms of polystyrene as measured by gel permeation chromatography. More preferably, the number-average molecular weight is from 8000 to 30000 and the acid value is from 30 to 120 mg KOH/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When the number-average molecular weight of the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group is less than 1000, the elongation and strength of the cured film made of the photosensitive composition are sometimes impaired. On the other hand, when the number-average molecular weight exceeds 40000, the pliability is likely to be lowered because the cured film becomes too hard. When the acid value is less than 5 mg KOH/g, the alkali solubility of the photosensitive composition may become inferior. On the other hand, when the acid value exceeds 150 mg KOH/g, the alkali resistance and electrical characteristics of the cured film may become inferior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The acid value of the urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A) having a carboxyl group is, as mentioned above, preferably within the range of 5 to 150 mg KOH/g. However, even within such a range, if the acid value is increased, there is a tendency for the developability to be improved, while the pliability of the cured film is degraded. On the other hand, if the acid value is decreased, there is a tendency for the pliability of the cured film to be improved, while the developability is degraded and developer remnant occurs readily. However, if a combination of at least two urethane (meth)acrylate compounds (A) having carboxyl groups and having different acid values are used, it is possible to easily obtain a photosensitive composition with which it is possible to form a cured film having superior pliability and which has excellent developability. In particular, it is preferable to use at least one of each of a urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A-1) having a carboxyl group having an acid value of 5 mg KOH/g or greater and less than 60 mg KOH/g, and a urethane (meth)acrylate compound (A-2) having a carboxyl group having an acid value of 60 mg KOH/g or greater and 150 mg KOH/g or less.

The particle diameter of the epoxy resin is preferably a particle diameter which does not exert an adverse influence on screen printing. For example, the entire photosensitive composition before curing is not uniformly transparent, and at least portion thereof is opaque. The pot life of the photosensitive composition is prolonged when the photosensitive composition before curing is a heterogeneous system containing the phase of the epoxy resin and, therefore, it is preferred. </paragraph>

When the amount of the thermopolymerization catalyst (E) is smaller than 0.5 parts by mass, the curing reaction does not proceed sufficiently, thereby lowering the heat resistance. Since it becomes necessary to cure at high temperature for a long time, the working efficiency is lowered.

Particularly, the photosensitive composition is suited for use as an insulating protective coating film of a printed circuit board because the photosensitive composition is superior in photosensitivity and developability and a thin film obtained by curing the photosensitive composition is superior in adhesion with the board, insulation properties, heat resistance, warp resistance, pliability, hardness and appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The insulating protective coating film is formed by the method of applying a photosensitive composition or ink on a board, on which a circuit is formed, in a thickness of 10 to 100 &mgr;m, subjecting to a heat treatment at a temperature ranging from 60 to 100&deg; C. for about 5 to 30 minutes, thereby drying the photosensitive composition or ink and forming a coating film having a thickness of 5 to 70 &mgr;m, exposing to light via a negative mask provided with a desired exposure pattern, removing the non-exposed portion with a developer, thereby developing the exposed portion, and heat-curing at a temperature ranging from 100 to 180&deg; C. for about 10 to 40 minutes. This photosensitive composition is particularly suited for use as an insulating protective coating film of an FPC board because the cured article thereof is particularly superior in pliability and flexibility, thus making it possible to form an FPC board which is less likely to cause curling and is superior in handling properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> For example, it can also be used as an insulating resin layer between layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The activating light used in the exposure may be activating light generated from a known activating light source such as carbon arc, mercury vapor arc, or xenon arc lamps. The photopolymerization initiator (D) contained in the photosensitive layer usually has a maximum sensitivity in the ultraviolet range and in this case, the activating light source is preferably one which effectively emits ultraviolet rays. In the case in which the photopolymerization initiator (D) is sensitive to visible rays, e.g., 9, 10-phenanthrenequinione, visible rays are used as activating light. As the light source, for example, photographic electric bulbs and sun lamps can be used, in addition to the activating light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As the developer, for example, aqueous alkali solutions of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium silicate, ammonia, and amines can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive composition of the present invention can be used in a photosensitive layer of a photosensitive dry film. The photosensitive dry film comprises a support made of a polymer film and a photosensitive layer made of a photosensitive composition formed on the support. The thickness of the photosensitive layer is preferably from 10 to 70 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Examples of the polymer film used as the support include films made of a polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate or aliphatic polyester, or a polyolefin resins such as polypropylene or low-density polyethylene. Among these polymer films, films made of polyester and low-density polyethylene are preferred, a film made of polyester is more preffered. It is preferred that these polymer films be easily removable from the photosensitive layer because they must be removed from the photosensitive layer later. The thickness of the polymer film is usually from 5 to 100 &mgr;m, and preferably from 10 to 30 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive dry film can be produced by the method having the step of applying a photosensitive composition on a support and drying the photosensitive composition to form a photosensitive layer. By forming a cover film on the photosensitive layer formed, the support, the photosensitive layer and the cover film are laminated in order, thus making it possible to produce a photosensitive dry film having a film on both surfaces of the photosensitive layer. Although the cover film is peeled off immediately before use of the photosensitive dry film, the photosensitive layer can be protected by forming the cover film on the photosensitive layer before use, thus obtaining a photosensitive dry film having excellent pot life. As the cover film, the same polymer film as that used in the support described above can be used. The cover film and the support may be made of the same or different material, and the thickness may be the same or different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> To form an insulating protective coating film on a printed circuit board by using the photosensitive dry film, a laminating step of laminating a photosensitive layer of the photosensitive film and a board is carried out, first. When using the photosensitive dry film provided with a cover film, the photosensitive layer is brought into contact with the board after the cover film is peeled off to expose the photosensitive layer. Then, the photosensitive layer and the board are thermo compression bonded at about 40 to 120&deg; C. using a pressure roller and the like, thereby laminating the photosensitive layer on the board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Then, an exposure step of exposing the photosensitive layer to light via a negative mask provided with a desired exposure pattern, a step of peeling off the support from the photosensitive layer, a developing step of removing the non-exposed portion with a developer, thereby developing the exposed portion, and a heat-curing step of heat-curing the photosensitive layer are carried out, thereby making it possible to produce a printed- circuit board comprising a board and an insulating protective coating film formed on the surface of the board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> An insulating resin layer may be formed between layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board by using such a photosensitive dry film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As the activating light used in the exposure and developer, the same active light and developer as those described above can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When using such a photosensitive composition, it is made possible to form a cured film which has a beautiful appearance, pliability, warp resistance and hardness, and is superior in photosensitivity and developability, and also satisfies performance requirements such as heat resistance, electrical insulating properties, and adhesion to the circuit board. This cured film is particularly superior in pliability, electrical insulating properties and appearance. Therefore, the photosensitive composition does not cause curing even when used in a thin circuit board such as an FPC board and is capable of forming an insulating protective coating film having excellent electrical performance and handling properties as well as good pliability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> As described above, the photosensitive composition of the present invention can simultaneously satisfy performance requirements with respect to formation of the photosensitive coating film (e.g. photosensitivity, developability, etc.) and performance requirements for the insulating protective coating film (e.g., heat resistance, electrical insulating properties, adhesion to the circuit board, etc.), and which is capable of forming a cured film having pliability, hardness, warp resistance and good appearance. Therefore, the photosensitive composition is suitable for use as an insulating protective coating film for printed circuit boards. Since the cured film made of the photosensitive composition of the present invention is particularly superior in pliability, curling does not occur even when used for a thin circuit board. Therefore, the cured film is best suited for use in an FPC board. </paragraph>
