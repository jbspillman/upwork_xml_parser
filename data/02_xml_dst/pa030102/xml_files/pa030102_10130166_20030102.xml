<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to integrated optical switching devices, and particularly to such devices for use in high-speed data communication applications, such as in packet switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The rapid growth in transmission bandwidths of fiber-optic networks is enabled by, among several critical factors, enhanced switching performance with respect to both switching speed and signal routing. High speed and large port-count switch arrays are becoming progressively important for high-speed data transmissions applications, in particular those supporting packet switching. Various array architectures have been developed as described for example in; R. Y. Awdeh, H. T. Mouftah: <highlight><italic>Survey of ATM Switch Architectures&rdquo;, </italic></highlight>Communications Networks and ISDN systems, Vol. 27, pp. 1567-1613, November 1995 (Elvesier Science); L. Thylen, <highlight><italic>Integrated Optics in LiNbO</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>: Recent Developments in Devices for Telecommunications, </italic></highlight>Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 6, No. 6, June 1988 (pages 847-861); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,618,210; 4,787,693; and International Publication No. WO 99/60434, published November 25, 1999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However those optical switching devices that support minimum level of route-control processing complexity are more suitable for high-speed switch response. Reduced routing procedures are provided by a family of array architectures, in particular the crossbar and its derivative&mdash;the double-crossbar; see for example the R. A. Spanke publication cited above. Other designs are known as the DC, PILOSS, TREE. Recently an SNB (strictly-non-blocking) 16&times;16 switch-array based on the TREE architecture and implemented in Z-cut LN, was reported &lsqb;S. Thaniyavarn, Proceedings OFC-97, TuC1&rsqb;. The TREE based device consists of three parts: fan-out, fan-in, and a mid-section consisting of a large silica/Si substrate, housing the connections between the 256 ports in both the input and output mid-planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The above-cited International Publication No. WO 99/60434 reported a recent study of a DC (Deliver and Couple) type array architecture, based on radial layout implemented Z-cut LN and TM guidance, which was shown to support a 16&times;16 port-count with &lt;10 nSec reconfiguration time. The short switching-speed was aided by the fact that in only 2N switches (out of 2N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>switches) are activated at each of the possible N&excl; route options, and the path setting is achieved merely by straightforward selection of the input-output ports. LN Z-cut substrate accommodates operation in the TM mode, independently of the propagation angle on the substrate, due to the invariance of the refractive indexes at the propagation plane (which is not possible with X or Y cut LN). Since the major electro-optic effect operates perpendicularly to the substrate surface in this case, the switches may be oriented at any angle. In particular, the switches may be designed with curvatures. While the routing procedure is much the same as that of the crossbar architecture (or the double-crossbar), the design has the disadvantage of route-dependent switch paths (i.e. paths having 2 to N&plus;1 switches), which becomes a significant issue when the individual switch losses exceed a certain level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The double-crossbar architecture, on the other hand, supports a similar path control procedure, and has the advantage of equal switch-paths (always N&plus;1). However, implementation of the double-crossbar by conventional waveguide elements is entirely impractical due to the very large number of waveguide intersections at shallow angles, which induce high losses and cross-talk levels, and in consequence lead to excessive array length. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an integrated optical switching device having advantages in the above respects, and particularly to provide such a device which enables high packing density of waveguide elements on a single substrate. A further object of the invention is to provide an integrated optical switching device which can be implemented in a double-crossbar switching network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an integrated optical switching device comprising a substrate formed with a plurality of optical input waveguides, a plurality of optical output waveguides, and a plurality of optical switching elements for selectively connecting the optical input waveguides to the optical output waveguides; characterized in that at least some of the waveguides include tight bends having a radius of curvature of less than 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to further features in the described preferred embodiments, at least some of the tight bends define an angle of approximately 90&deg; and have a radius of curvature of 20-60 &mgr;m. Such a construction permits very close spacing of less than 150 &mgr;m, preferably about 75 &mgr;m between waveguides. In addition, the 90&deg; crossings generate very low scattering losses and cross-talk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to further features in the described preferred embodiments, the tight bends, or at least some of them, are total internal reflection trench mirrors formed in the substrate, for example as described in H. Han et al, <highlight><italic>Self-Aligned High-Quality Total Internal Reflection Mirrors, </italic></highlight>IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 7, No. 8, August 1995 (pages 899-901), which publication is hereby incorporated by reference. The tight bends, or at least some of them, may also be tight ridge bends formed in the waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an integrated optical switching device, comprising: a circular wafer substrate formed with a plurality of optical input waveguides, a plurality of optical output waveguides, and a plurality of optical switching elements for selectively connecting the optical input waveguides to the optical output waveguides; the waveguides and switching elements defining a double-crossbar switching network arrayed according to a circular geometry; at least some of the waveguides including tight bends having a radius of curvature of less than 100 &mgr;m and spaced from adjacent waveguides by a space of less than 150 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to further features in the described preferred embodiments, the double-crossbar switching network includes a first circular array of input switch columns defining optical switches interconnected according to a first crossbar architecture, and a second circular array of output switch columns defining optical switches interconnected according to a second crossbar architecture; the second circular array of output switch columns being coaxial with, and connected to outputs of, the first array of input switch columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the described preferred embodiments, the second circular array of output switch columns is located on the substrate outwardly of the first circular array of input switch columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The foregoing features enable integrated optical switching devices to be constructed having a number of important advantages over the prior art constructions briefly described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A particularly important advantage is that these features enable optical switching devices to be constructed according to the DCB (double-crossbar) architecture. Thus, by employing either 90&deg; reflecting 3D mirrors, or tight ridge-waveguides bends, and also by implementing a radial geometry, the DCB architecture yields a superior packing-factor (i.e. number of switches or array dimensions) compared to the DC (delivery and couple) architecture. The 3D mirrors may be fabricated by the high precision &ldquo;RIE&rdquo; (reactive ion etching) process to provide high facet quality. Such 3D mirrors have previously been incorporated in commercial processing of laser diodes based on III-V materials (Oliver Graydon, Opto-Laser Europe, October 97, p. 11), but not in optical switch-arrays. Etched surfaces are employed for 90&deg; reflection in optical switch-arrays. The 45&deg; facet-angle provides for total-internal-reflection (TIR) if the two materials index-ratio &gt;1.4 (in the LN case the ratio is 2.14 and in the case of silica waveguides it is 1.45). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, tight ridge-waveguide bends may also be employed. In such case a similar effect is obtained and also the fabrication is easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The proposed layout is optimal in most aspects of connection path efficiency, except for the different number of crossings in the different paths. However, in this case, this is a relatively minor matter since waveguides intersecting at &tilde;90&deg; have practically negligible losses (when &Dgr;N&lt;&lt;N, as is the case in LN substrates, where &Dgr;N is the waveguide index-perturbation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition to providing for better area utilization, and thereby higher packing density, as compared to the DC architecture, the foregoing features permit improved processing uniformity, as compared to other designs, thereby also improving the pattern accuracy as well as the uniformity of the switching voltages (between the array&apos;s switches). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to still further features in one preferred embodiment described below, the input waveguides include a plurality of input rows, with each input row including a splitter for splitting the respective input row into a plurality of branches (preferably two); and the output waveguide includes a combiner for each plurality of the branches for combining them into their respective output waveguides. In this setup the &ldquo;maximum cross-talk figure&rdquo; of any of the array&apos;s outputs is reduced markedly (from a maximum of &tilde;&lsqb;N&minus;2&rsqb;X<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to &tilde;&lsqb;N/2&minus;1&rsqb;X<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, where X is the fractional cross-talk of the switch, and N is the number of the array columns/rows). As an example, the maximum cross-talk figure of the switch array will be the same when the switch cross-talk is &minus;20dB in the former design and 13.5dB in the design discussed here. This allows the relaxation of the critical design parameters of the individual switch, while the overall performance improves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the invention is particularly useful in applications wherein the switching elements define a DCB (double-crossbar) switching network. In one described embodiment, the substrate is a three-inch circular LN wafer, and the DCB switching network includes an array of 16&times;16 to 20&times;20 switching elements arrayed according to a circular geometry; in a second described embodiment, the substrate is a four-inch circular LN wafer, and the DCB switching network includes an array of 16&times;16 to 24&times;24 switching elements arrayed according to a circular geometry; in a third described embodiment, the substrate is a five-inch circular LN wafer, and the waveguides and switching elements define a DCB switching network of up to 32&times;32 switching elements. Such packing densities have heretofore not being obtainable insofar as the inventor is presently aware (on a single substrate, and while supporting the strictly-non-blocking property). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the substrate is a Z-cut lithium niobate (LN) substrate. However, the invention could be implemented as well with other substrate materials. A most attractive option is the electro-optic polymer (EO-polymer) waveguide patterned on a silicon substrate (or other substrates such as quartz). A particularly attractive option is the silica/electro-optic polymer (EO-polymer waveguide composite (or similarly silicon oxy-nitride instead of silica), patterned on a silicon substrate. By this method, as an example, the EO polymer is patterned between the silica waveguides at the switch zone. The silica waveguides presently have the lowest propagation losses. With adequate switch design, light propagates predominantly in the low loss silica waveguides at the straight through state, and permeates the higher loss EO polymer medium when at the cross state. Since the refractive indexes of silica and EO-polymer are nearly the same, the transition between the two mediums is virtually without loss. Silica waveguides are easily designed for tight bends or alternatively can be easily etched to provide high quality 45&deg; TIR mirrors. Silica or polymer waveguide technologies can be patterned on substrates with diameters as large as 6 or 8 inches, potentially supporting array designs with port counts higher than 32&times;32 on a single substrate. However, in practice, the choice of the substrate materials depends on the propagation loss, electrical power consumption, and finally pattern uniformity, according to the processing technology available at the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still further features in another preferred embodiment described below, the substrate is of a rectangular shape and the waveguides in the arrays are patterned accordingly, in a rectangular loop. This embodiment may be particularly useful with silica or polymer waveguide technologies, and provides improved utilization of the substrate area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description below.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates a plurality of waveguides and switching elements defining a double-crossbar (DCB) switching network. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first group of waveguides and switching elements are arranged to define a first crossbar (CB) indicated by box CB<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>serving as an input array IA, and another group of waveguides and switch elements are arranged to define a second crossbar, indicated by box CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>connected to the output ends of the crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, of the input array, IA, and serving as an output array OA. The waveguides of the input array IA are connected by tight bends TB to the waveguides of the output array OA. Each tight bend TB may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>to define an angle of approximately 90&deg; and to have a radius of curvature of less than 100 &mgr;m, preferably of 20-60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of the electro-optical switches EOS in the input array IA is of the 1&times;2 type, wherein a signal appearing in an input waveguide may be selectively passed through the interaction zone to appear in the same waveguide at the output, or crossed in the interaction zone to appear in an adjacent waveguide. On the other hand, each of the electro-optical switches EOS in the output array OA is of the 2&times;1 type, wherein the signal on either of two input waveguides is controlled to pass through the interaction zone into the output waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The switching array illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is of a SNB (Strictly Non-Blocking) architecture, and includes a 4&times;4 array, requiring 2&times;4&times;4, or 32, electro-optical switches EOS. That is, each path requires the activation of two switches, such that for any routing configuration, 2&times;N switches are to be activated out of the 2&times;N&times;N. Such an array prevents the occurrence of conflicting paths, and supports broadcast and multicast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further details of the operation of such DCB (double-crossbar) switching networks are described in the literature, for example in the above-cited 1987 publication of R. A. Spanke, incorporated herein by reference. However, as described earlier, the double-crossbar switching network diagrammatically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was, as a practical matter, heretofore impossible to be implemented on an integrated optical wafer because of the very large number of waveguide intersections at shallow angles, which induce high losses and cross talk noise, and in consequence, lead to excessive array lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, such a DCB switching network is implemented by providing the waveguides, or at least some of them, with the tight bends shown at TB in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Each of the tight bends TB has a radius of curvature of less than 100 &mgr;m, preferably in the order of 20-60 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate two manners of producing such tight bends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates the tight bend TB between the two waveguides in the form of a 90&deg; waveguide knee bend with a total internal reflection (TIR) trench mirror TRM formed in the substrate. The above-cited publication of 1995 by H. Han et al, incorporated herein by reference, describes one manner of fabricating such a TIR mirror using a reactive ion etching (RIE) technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates another manner of forming such a tight bend TB, wherein the waveguide is formed as a tight ridge bend in the substrate, by etching the regions ER surrounding the bend. The bend radius could be in the order of tens of &mgr;m. Preferably, a substantially 90&deg; bend is formed with a radius of 20-60 &mgr;m. The bend losses due to radiation decrease with increased confinement degree. In LN waveguides, the confinement degree is very high because of the large index difference of the substrate and the air (2.15 vs 1). This is to be distinguished from other waveguides wherein the index contrast is very small, in which case typical low loss radii are larger by several orders of magnitude, e.g., radii of millimeters or tens of millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As described more particularly below, providing such tight bends TB produces a number of important advantages in integrated-optical switching devices in general, which advantages are particularly significant in DCB (double-crossbar) switching networks arrayed according to a circular geometry. Thus, such tight bends enable the spacings between the matrix rows to be extremely small, in the order of 75-150 &mgr;m, thereby permitting extremely high-packing density of optical switches on a single substrate. In addition, implementing the network in a circular format on a Z-cut LN substrate is permitted due to the non-limited angular orientation of the waveguides and switches when operating with the TM polarized optical mode. The resulting combined advantages are optimum radial symmetry, which also improves processing uniformity and therefore fabrication yield, and a high level of uniformity in the switching voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the invention implemented in a three-inch circular wafer formed with a DCB (double-crossbar) switching network including a 2&times;20&times;20 array according to a circular geometry. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each of the 20 switch columns in the input array IA includes an input crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>at the periphery of the circular wafer, and an output crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>also at the periphery of the wafer but outwardly of the input array crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Crossbars CB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, are interconnected to define a circular input array IA, and crossbars CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are interconnected to define a circular output array OA coaxially with, and outwardly of, the input array IA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substrate further includes an inner array of electrical pads IEP arranged in a rectangular matrix on top of the substrate. Each pad is connected by a lead (not shown) to one particular switch in the array. The pads form the electrical contact points to the external control circuit, serving for selectively actuating the optical switches defined by the waveguides in the crossbars CB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the input and output arrays IA, OA, respectively. Pads IEP are connected to the external control-circuit by conventional wire bonds or alternatively by an overlying PCB (not shown). The illustrated substrate further includes a rectangular array of outer electrical pads OEP, outwardly of the waveguide crossbars CB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, CB<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, these pads being accessed as well either by conventional bonding technology or by an overlying PCB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an enlarged fragmentary view of region &ldquo;A&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, more particularly illustrating the electrical and optical connections between the input array crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and output array crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in two adjacent switch columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>particularly illustrates a waveguide WC with two 90&deg; bends, connecting between the crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the input array IA, and the crossbar CB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the output array OA, as well as the electrical connections EC from the electro-optical switches EOS to the pads (of the indicated switched path). The entire path from input to output, traverses four 90&deg; tight bends (e.g., reflections or tight ridge bends), and the total propagation path is approximately 200 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Considering accepted values with the present technology processing techniques of 1.5 dB loss per tight bend by reflection, 0.1 dB/cm propagation loss, 0.5 dB coupling loss at the substrate interface, and negligible switch losses, the expected insertion losses would amount to approximately 9 dB. Even this would be acceptable in this application, but it is expected that improved processing techniques will even further reduce the insertion losses to about 6 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus, a Z-cut LN three-inch wafer, with 100 &mgr;m spacing between the array rows, and with 4 mm spacing between the wafer perimeter and the external array row, can support an array of 16&times;16 to 20&times;20 switches, with the individual switch length of 6 mm. A properly designed 6-mm long switch can be switched with an amplitude of less than 15V. Electrodes at this length, with typical capacity range of &tilde;5 pF, can alternate between switch states at &lt;10 nSec by employing state-of-art electronics. Based on the above parameters, as an example in a 20&times;20 array of switches, the waveguide-array would be 4 mm in width, occupying a radial zone between R&equals;29 mm and R&equals;33 mm, and would have curvatures that have been proved previously to support sufficiently low propagation losses &lsqb;E. Voges et. Al, <highlight><italic>True time delay integrated optical RF phase shifters in lithium niobate, </italic></highlight>Elec. Lett., Vol. 33, No. 23, pp.1950-51, November 97&rsqb;. Both factors, i.e. the array-pattern confinement in a narrow radial width, as well as the radial layout in itself, contribute to the fabrication uniformity, and therefore to the enhancement of the lithographic yield factors, in terms of both overall registration accuracy, and low fault probability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Whereas the described construction can be implemented on a three-inch wafer to support an array of 16&times;16 to 20&times;20 switching elements, particularly a 2&times;20&times;20 array, this same construction can be implemented on a four inch Z-LN substrate to support an array of 16&times;16 to 24&times;24 switching elements, particularly a 2&times;24&times;24 array, with individual switch lengths of 7 mm. In addition, a considerably larger port count can be supported by the same substrate by splitting each annular array into two concentric ribbon of row bundles to form an array band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the invention implemented in a four-inch wafer formed with a double-crossbar switching network including a 2&times;32&times;32 array in two concentric ribbons or bands. As an example, a 2&times;32&times;32 array could be split into outer and inner interconnected annular bands (or row bundles) of 18 and 14 columns, respectively, with each column including 32 switches, and with an individual switch length of 7 mm. The innermost row in the inner ribbon (or row bundle) would have a diameter of 64 mm, thereby supporting very low curvature losses. The insertion loss is estimated to be of the order of 10-14 dB. The electrodes of the inner annular ribbon (or row bundle) are accessed electrically from the substrate&apos;s center zone, IEP, while those of the outer ribbons would be accessed electrically from the outer electrical pads OEP or by an overlying PCB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates a technique using splitters S and combiners C particularly for switching networks having a large matrix of switching elements to occupy a relatively small-diameter wafer. Such a technique is particularly useful for providing a matrix of 2&times;32&times;32 switching elements arrayed in concentric circles on a four-inch wafer, as compared to a maximum of 2&times;24&times;24 using the design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Briefly, this technique involves: (1) splitting each of the input rows to a plurality (two) of branches at the input access; (2) combining the output rows in reversed fashion; and (3) increasing the number of electrical and optical connections to accommodate the above modification. This technique enables obtaining a 2&times;32&times;32 array on a four inch or five-inch Z-cut LN substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates four input rows 41-44 coupled to four output rows 51-54, respectively. The coupling is accomplished with only two switch columns, instead of the four in the conventional DCB (double-crossbar) scheme, and with eight rows, which are actually four split rows. An N&times;N switch will require 2&times;N&times;N switches as previously, but also an additional 2&times;N switches for splitting at splitters S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-S<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and combining at combiners C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4, </subscript></highlight>respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By thus doubling the number of the rows, the number of the columns is halved, and therefore the effective switch column number is increased per given array length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates an implementation of the splitting/combining technique of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> applied to form, on a four-inch (or a five-inch) circular wafer, a DCB (double-crossbar) switching network including a 2&times;32&times;32 array. Preferably, the splitting and combining switch columns (SA and CA) are located at the central zone of the wafer, so that all the circular section is available for the switching columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The splitting/combining technique of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has the additional advantage of providing for reduced average crosstalk: Half of the possible paths in the switch array include the combining and splitting switches set at OFF state. The optical-power leakage from this half into the selected paths is reduced by a factor of X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, where X is the fractional crosstalk of the switch. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates an implementation of the same DCB architectures described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on a rectangular substrate. More particularly, it illustrates a 2&times;32&times;32 DCB array with rectangular geometry. This layout may be preferred when employing silica or polymer waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The described switch-array concept may be implemented, in general, with all known substrate materials that support TIR trench mirrors of adequate quality, or tight ridge waveguide bends. Fabrication may be done by a routine fabrication sequence, e.g., as follows: (1) pattern the waveguides; (2) apply the waveguide cladding; (3) pattern the electrodes; (4) fabricate the knee-bends/ridge-bends; (5) package in a box; (6) make the electrical connections (by conventional wire-bonding and/or flip-chip contacting); and (7) make the fiber ribbon connections (&ldquo;pigtailing&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The electrical leads from the electrodes to the pads, in the particular radial switch design, extend either into the substrate&apos;s center or to the substrate&apos;s perimeter (likely to both zones). Alternatively, the pads could be designed to share the electrode zones adjacent to the waveguides, and the electrical interfacing is achieved by employing the &ldquo;flip chip&rdquo; technology. By the latter option, spacing between the switch-columns otherwise occupied by the leads, according to the first option, can be used for increased switch lengths (and therefore for improved switch performance). The later method is also more efficient for interfacing large number of electrical ports with the PC (printed circuit) board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the examples referred to array dimensions of N&times;N. However, the Double-Crossbar architecture applies as well to array dimensions of N&times;M, where M&ne;N, N and M are the number of input and output ports, respectively. </paragraph>
