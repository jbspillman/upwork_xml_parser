<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to aqueous solutions of amino group-containing silanol compounds, glass substrates and glass fibers which are surface-treated with the solutions, and processes for the preparation of aqueous solutions of amino-containing silanol compounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Hydrolyzable silanes which have been extensively used as silane coupling agents and surface treating agents for various substrates are utilized after a hydrolyzable group in the silanes has been hydrolyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent No. 2508554 discloses, as an example of such hydrolyzable silanes, aqueous solutions of amino group-containing silanol compounds prepared by hydrolyzing aminoalkoxysilanes and removing by-producing alcohols. The amino group-containing silanol compounds, which have undergone the hydrolysis and removal of the by-producing alcohols, are materials wherein a volatile organic compound such as an alcohol is relatively difficult to generate when used in the surface treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the aqueous solutions of amino group-containing silanol compounds disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2508554 might lack storage stability, depending on storage conditions. Moreover, when the aqueous solutions of amino group-containing silanol compounds were allowed to stand in contact with air, ethyl alcohol exceeding 1000 ppm (0.1 MPa, 25&deg; C.) which is an allowable concentration advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) might be emitted into air, depending on the conditions under which they are allowed to stand. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention is described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the formula (I) of the invention, n is an integer of 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 4, and more preferably 3. A hydrolyzable silane containing an aminopropyl group wherein n is 3 has good water-solubility. The aminoalkyl silanes represented by the formula (1) according to the invention may be commercially available ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the invention, R in the formula (1) is not particularly limited, so long as it is a hydrolyzable group. Preferably, R is an alkylalkoxy group of not more than 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such a hydrolyzable group include methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy and the like. If R is an alkylalkoxy group of not more than 4 carbon atoms, a volatile organic compound producing by the hydrolysis has a relatively low boiling point, and is easily removed from the reaction solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the reaction of the aminoalkoxysilane of the formula (1) with water (hydrolysis reaction), if the proportion of water used in the reaction is less than 1.5 moles per one mole of the aminoalkoxysilane, the reaction may not proceed sufficiently and the hydrolyzable group may remain unreacted. If the proportion exceeds 10 moles per one mole of the aminoalkoxysilane, the efficiency in the distillation of the volatile organic compound subsequent to the hydrolysis reaction may deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the temperature for the hydrolysis is not particularly limited, but it is preferably in the range of 0 to 150&deg; C., more preferably 40 to 120&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A method for distilling off the volatile organic compound by-producing in the hydrolysis reaction is not particularly limited, but the distillation is carried out preferably under the pressure of 1 Pa to 0.1 MPa. The temperature is preferably in the range of 0 to 150&deg; C., more preferably 40 to 120&deg; C., but not limited thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the by-producing volatile organic compound is distilled off until its content becomes less than 4% by weight relative to the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound. The content of the organic compound is less than 4% by weight, but it is preferably 2% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The temperature for the hydrolysis and the temperature for distilling off the by-producing volatile organic compound are as described above. The hydrolysis and the distilling off are preferably carried out in the range of 0 to 150&deg; C. in view of good efficiency and no deterioration of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the distillation of the by-producing volatile organic compound according to the invention, it is preferable to add to a reaction solution water of the same weight as the volatile organic compound to be removed from the reaction solution by distillation. This addition can prevent condensation of the reaction solution and the resultant increase in the viscosity and reduction in the efficiency of distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the proportion of silicon contained in the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound is preferably in the range of 7.5 to 17% by weight, based on the weight of the aqueous solution. If it is more than 17% by weight, the viscosity of the aqueous solution tends to exceedingly increase, thereby lowering the flowability, which leads to the difficulty in keeping the quality constant. If it is less than 7.5% by weight, the storage stability of the aqueous solution may decrease, resulting in the occurrence of coloration or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The proportion of silicon contained in the aqueous solutions of an amino group-containing silanol compound can be controlled in such a manner that the concentration of an amino group-containing silanol compound is determined as a nonvolatile matter and adjusted to 30-67% by weight by dilution with water or by distillation operation. The proportion of silicon contained can be confirmed by a known method for measuring the content of silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound according to the invention is clear and colorless or slightly yellowish. Since the content of the volatile organic compound upon the production is less than 4% by weight, the emission of a volatile organic compound into air at ordinary temperature and pressure can be controlled below the allowable concentration advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Since the by-producing volatile organic compound is removed after complete hydrolysis of the hydrolyzable group, the content of the by-producing volatile organic compound does not increase more than the level contained upon the production, even if said aqueous solution is diluted further with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> After completion of the removal of the by-producing volatile organic compound by distillation, the concentration of the amino group-containing silanol compounds in the reaction solution may be measured and, if necessary, adjusted to any level within the range not impairing the effects of the invention by dilution with water or by concentration with re-distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As the concentration of the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound is lower, the content of a silanetriol form having a monomer structure more increases. However, the aqueous solution also contains an oligomer compound which is considered to improve the film-forming properties of the solution when used as a surface treating agent. In addition, the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound are very stable, and no alteration is observed in the content of a volatile organic compound, the average composition and appearance even after the storage test was carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The aqueous solutions of-an amino group-containing silanol compound are useful as silane coupling agents or surface treating agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The composition and physical properties of the surface treating agents of the invention are not particularly limited, so long as those agents comprise the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound of the invention. The surface treating agents may contain pigments, antifoaming agents, lubricants, preservatives, pH adjustors, film-forming agents, antistatic agents, antibacterial agents, surface active agents, dyestuffs or the like, within the range not impairing the effects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The proportion of the aqueous solution of an amino group-containing silanol compound contained in the surface treating agent of the invention is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 50% by weight based on the treating agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The uses of the aqueous solutions of an amino group-containing silanol compound and the surface treating agents comprising the same can include, but not limited to, treatment of glass fibers, liquid sealing agents, casting molds, resin concrete, surface modification of resins, additives for water-based coatings or the like. When they are used in the surface treatment of glass fibers and glass substrates such as glass plates, especially desirable effects are obtained due to good wetting and good adherence to the surface of glass substrates, which are characteristics of aminosilane. </paragraph>
