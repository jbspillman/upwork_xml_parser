<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;allergic and inflammatory condition of the skin or airway passages&rdquo; as used herein means those allergic and inflammatory conditions and symptoms found on the skin and in the upper and lower airway passages from the nose to the lungs. Typical allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin or upper and lower airway passages include seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, asthma including allergic and non-allergic asthma, sinusitis, colds (in combination with a NSAID, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen or APAP) and/or a decongestant e.g. pseudoephedrine), dermatitis, especially allergic and atopic dermatitis, and urticaria and symptomatic dermographism as well as retinophathy, and small vessel diseases, associated with diabetes mellitus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The amount of desloratadine effective for treating or preventing allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin or airway passages will vary with the age, sex, body weight, growth and developmental changes as well as the severity of the allergic and inflammatory condition of the pediatric patient. Typically, the amount of desloratadine effective for treating or preventing such allergic and inflammatory conditions is in the range of about 2.5 mg/day for pediatric patients, ages 6 to less than 12 years, about 1.25 mg/day for pediatric patients, ages 2 to less than 6 years, and about 0.60 to about 0.70 mg/day, preferably about 0.63 mg/day, more preferably about 0.625 mg/day for pediatric patients, ages 6 months to less than 2 years, in single or divided doses, preferably a single daily dose in the form of a syrup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Desloratadine is a non-sedating long acting histamine antagonist with potent selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Following oral administration, loratadine is rapidly metabolized to descarboethoxyloratadine or desloratadine, a pharmacologically active metabolite. In vitro and in vivo animal pharmacology studies have been conducted to assess various pharmacodynamic effects of desloratadine and loratadine. In assessing antihistamine activity in mice (comparison of ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value), desloratadine was relatively free of producing alterations in behavior alterations in behavior, neurologic or autonomic function. The potential for desloratadine or loratadine to occupy brain H1-receptors was assessed in guinea pigs following i.p. administration and results suggest poor access to central histamine receptors for desloratadine or loratadine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In vivo studies also suggest that an inhibitory effect of desloratadine on allergic bronchospasm and cough can also be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine has been documented in over 3,200 seasonal allergic rhinitis patients in 4 double-blinded, randomized clinical trials. The results of these clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of desloratadine in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal rhinitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Efficacy endpoints in all the studies were Total Symptom Score, Total Nasal Symptom Score, Total Non-nasal Symptom Score, and Health Quality of Life (HQOL) analysis in efficacy trials. Desloratadine (5 mg once daily) significantly reduced the total symptom scores (the sum of individual scores for rhinorrhea, sneezing, congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, itchy/burning eyes, tearing, ocular redness, and itchy ears/palate). Desloratadine (5 mg) was significantly (p&lt;0.01) more effective than placebo in reducing nasal symptoms. An important efficacy endpoint analyzed in the desloratadine studies is the AM NOW total symptom score. This parameter measures the total symptom relief by the patient after 24 hours before taking the next day dose. Statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) reductions were maintained for the full 24 hour dosing interval over the entire dosage range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine (over the entire dosage range) across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race. Desloratadine is particularly useful for the treatment and prevention of the nasal (stuffiness/congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) and non-nasal (itchy/burning eyes, tearing/watery eyes, redness of the eyes, itching of the ears/palate) symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, in patients in need of such treating and/or preventing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Clinical Study Designs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Study Treatments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Subjects were confined to the study site at least 12 hours prior to each treatment administration. In the morning of Day 1 following a 10 hour overnight fast, each subject received one of the following treatments based on his/her subject number and the study period: fasting (Treatment A) or did not eat again (Treatment B) until the 4-hour study procedures were completed, at which time lunch was served. Water was permitted throughout the fasting period except for 2 hours following treatment administration. The subjects remained awake and seated upright/ambulatory for 4 hours post-dose. A physician was present at the time of dosing and remained on site until at least 4 hours post-dose. Subjects were under medical supervision throughout their confinement at the study site. Each treatment administration was separated by at least a 7 day washout period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Pharmacokinetics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Blood samples were collected for determination of the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine. Fifteen milliliters (15 mL) of blood were collected just prior to drug administration (0 hour) and at pre-specified times after dosing in both periods. All blood samples were collected into heparin-containing tubes at the specified times. The blood samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes after collection for 20 minutes at approximately 4&deg; C. and at approximately 3000 rpm. The plasma was separated and transferred into two separate appropriately labeled tubes, frozen to at least &minus;20&deg; C. and maintained in the frozen state until assayed for desloratadine content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The plasma concentration data for desloratadine were used to estimate the following pharmacokinetic parameters using standard methodologies well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The major pharmacokinetic variables of interest were the plasma AUC and Cmax. All plasma samples were assayed for desloratadine concentrations using a validated method such as gas/liquid chromatography with a NP detector(GLC/NPD). The validation of the assay methods included documentation of its selectivity, limit of quantitation, linearity, precision and accuracy. The lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the assay was established at 0.1 ng/mL for desloratadine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Safety Measurements Assessed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For safety evaluation, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests were conducted at screening and at the conclusion of the study. In addition, vital signs were monitored prior to treatment administration and daily during both treatment periods. Additional clinical laboratory tests and ECGs were obtained prior to dosing in each treatment period. The assessment, severity and relationship to treatment of adverse events were evaluated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Subjects were screened within 3 weeks of dosing, and those who met the entry criteria were confined to the study center within 24 hours prior to dosing. Upon confinement, the clinical laboratory safety tests performed at Screening were repeated for each subject. The next morning all subjects received the study medication. Vital signs were obtained daily. Blood samples were collected at pre-specified times before and after dosing for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluations. Subjects were continually observed and questioned throughout the study for the possible occurrence of adverse events. Subjects were also instructed to report any unusual experiences or discomfort. No strenuous physical activity was permitted, and the subjects were not allowed visitors (besides the parents or legal guardians) while they were confined to the study site. Following the 24-hour study-related procedures for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluations, subjects were dismissed from the study site. They returned to the study site on Days 3, 4 and 5 for the 48-hour, 72-hour and 96-hour study-related procedures.

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Desloratadine is available from Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, N.J. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The desloratadine syrup (0.5 mg/ml) is disclosed in International Patent Application PCT/US99/10469 having an international application date of May 27, 1999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions of desloratadine can be adapted for any mode of administration e.g., for oral, parenteral, e.g., subcutaneous (&ldquo;SC&rdquo;), intramuscular (&ldquo;IM&rdquo;), and intraperitoneal (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;), topical or vaginal administration or by inhalation (orally or intranasally). Preferably desloratadine is administered orally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Such pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated by combining desloratadine or an equivalent amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a suitable, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent that may be either solid or liquid. Desloratadine may be converted into the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by admixing it with an equivalent amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Typically suitable pharmaceutically aceptable acids include the mineral acids, e.g., HNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, HCl, HBr, organic acids, including, but not limited to, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, lactic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, glucuronic and citric acids as well as alkyl or arylsulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, or methanesulfonic acid. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are trifluoroacetate, tosylate, mesylate, and chloride. Desloratadine is more stable as the free base than as an acid addition salt and the use of the desloratadine free base in pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Solid form preparations may be converted into liquid preparations shortly before use for either oral or administration. Parenteral forms to be injected intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously are usually in the form of sterile solutions and may contain tonicity agents (salts or glucose), and buffers. Opacifiers may be included in oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g., nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, syrups suspensions and emulsions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. </paragraph>
