<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to wind tunnel models. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a wind tunnel model design using rapid prototype components and a reinforcing strongback. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Whether an airframe is a new design, modification of an existing design, or evaluation of a competing or foreign design, an accurate, high-confidence representation of the airframe aerodynamics is paramount to any low-risk design or evaluation effort. These aerodynamic estimates are used for vehicle and component sizing, performance estimates, and autopilot design and evaluation. The only accepted method of obtaining the high fidelity aerodynamics data needed for these purposes is to build and test a scale model of the airframe in a wind tunnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most wind tunnel models are fabricated of all metal components using Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) milling machines. The dimensional accuracy, surface finish and strength of such all-metal models have a distinguished history of providing high fidelity aerodynamics data for both subsonic and supersonic aircraft and rocket designs. However, the fabrication of all-metal wind tunnel models is very expensive and time consuming. Following is a brief summary of the wind tunnel model construction process and of prior art attempts at reducing the costs and time invested in such models. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical aircraft development program usually needs at least four to five wind tunnel models to adequately test the aerodynamics of a new airframe. The models are generally made of aluminum (for lightly stressed components) or steel (for highly stressed components) and are sculpted using 3 to 5 axis CNC milling machines. The models can require months to manufacture and are often made by small high technology companies that specialize in wind tunnel model manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Wind tunnel models are generally supported in a wind tunnel by a positioning device that is often referred to as a sting. The rear portion of a model is usually hollow to allow the sting to penetrate the model body without affecting the aerodynamic properties of the model. A force transducer called a balance is attached to the inside of the model in order to measure forces and moments acting on the model (often measuring all six degrees of freedom: drag, sideforce, lift, roll, pitch and yaw). The sting is rigidly fixed to the balance and all lead wires from the balance and any other control lines or strain gage leads from the model are routed inside or along the sting and back to the control room of the wind tunnel facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The cost of fabricating and instrumenting a typical wind tunnel model is on the order of $100,000; however, complex models that include engine simulators, remote controlled control surfaces, numerous rows of pressure taps, etc., can cost over $1,000,000. Companies that are able to reduce the time and costs associated with wind tunnel models therefore stand to gain a significant competitive advantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For several years Rapid Prototype (RP) materials and methods have been considered as a potential source of improvements to conventional wind tunnel models. RP parts can generally be made much more rapidly and less expensively than conventional machined parts. RP manufacturing is a field of high technology concerning the generation of three-dimensional solids using particles or layers of mostly polymeric materials. Two of the most popular RP techniques include stereolithography (SLA&reg;) and fused deposition modeling (FDM&reg;). Both techniques build solid objects layer-by-layer based on data from a computer aided design (CAD) software program. SLA&reg; equipment is manufactured by 3D Systems, Inc. of Valencia Calif. and employs a laser beam to selectively solidify the surface layer of a photopolymer resin. The solidified surface layer forms a cross section of the prototype part. A supporting table then lowers the part several thousandths of an inch into the resin and the laser solidifies the next layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> FDM&reg; uses a proprietary technology developed by Stratasys, Inc., of Eden Prairie, Minn. It employs a movable nozzle to deposit a thread of molten ABS plastic. The thread solidifies instantly and forms the cross sectional layer of a part. A new thread is then deposited on top to form the next layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Significant use of RP components in high-load wind tunnel tests has not occurred, however, because of problems with material strength and fabrication tolerances. A study funded through the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) investigated the feasibility of using wind tunnel models constructed from RP materials and methods for preliminary aerodynamic assessment of future launch vehicle configurations. See A. Springer, &ldquo;Evaluating Aerodynamic Characteristics of Wind-Tunnel Models Produced by Rapid Prototyping Methods,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets</italic></highlight>, Vol. 35, No. 6, November-December 1998. The study concluded that &ldquo;RP methods and materials can be used only for preliminary design studies and limited configurations because of the RP material properties that allow bending of model components under high loading conditions and the tolerance on the fabrication processes.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another study was funded by Bombardier Aerospace, Inc. and conducted by McGill University to determine whether RP techniques could replace CNC machining of wind tunnel model components. See R. N. Chuk and V. J. Thomson, &ldquo;A Comparison of Rapid Prototyping Techniques Used for Wind Tunnel Model Fabrication,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Rapid Prototyping Journal</italic></highlight>, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1998, pp. 185-196. The study evaluated 22 different RP technologies and concluded that &ldquo;the current plastic materials of RP models do not provide the structural integrity necessary for the survival of wind tunnel models, especially for thin section parts such as tip fins and flaps.&rdquo; Further, the study found that the maximum allowable dimensions using RP machines are generally significantly less than traditional CNC machines and therefore larger scale single part models cannot be built. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is clear that increased use of RP components in wind tunnel models could dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with wind tunnel model fabrication. There is therefore a need for novel wind tunnel model design techniques that overcome some of the difficulties and deficiencies involving the use of RP components. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention, among other things, presents a solution to some of the aforementioned disadvantages associated with RP wind tunnel models. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a wind tunnel model design having improved strength and stiffness characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind tunnel model design that is less expensive and requires significantly less time to build than conventional designs associated with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a wind tunnel model design that may incorporate both RP components and conventional metal components so as to optimize cost, construction timing, and strength issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a wind tunnel model design that includes a reinforcing strongback, that may in some cases be reused, for connecting directly to a balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> These and other objects are achieved in the present invention in a wind tunnel model including a strongback, made of a rigid material and having an exterior axial surface, the strongback being designed to be supported by a balance. The strongback is at least partially inside the interior volume of a jacket section that is made of a rapid prototype (RP) material. The exterior axial surface of the strongback engages an interior axial surface of the jacket section, and the exterior surface of the jacket section defines at least part of an aerodynamic surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The techniques of the present invention are applicable to any wind tunnel model design intended for use with a balance for measuring forces and moments applied to the model. This includes aircraft such as planes, rockets and missiles as well as ground based vehicles such as high-speed racecars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the invention will become more fully apparent from the following more detailed description and the appended drawings that illustrate in detail one embodiment of the invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the elements of the present invention include a strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> around which the components of a wind tunnel model (WTM) are assembled. The strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be connected to a balance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that measures forces applied to the WTM. Balances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are typically made of steel and outfitted with strain-gages or other instrumentation that measure forces and moments. At least one RP jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is placed over the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a near-zero tolerance fit and defines at least part of the exterior aerodynamic surface of the WTM. Secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as a nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, inlets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, wings, engines, etc., may be attached to the RP jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or, for added strength, attached directly to the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Where necessary, slots <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B) are built into the RP jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to allow the secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, e.g., the mounting pad of a canard, to be placed firmly against the exterior surface of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the balance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located inside of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. During wind tunnel testing, the balance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be supported by a sting inserted through an opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the rear (downwind) end of the model. However many variations of this design are possible. For example, the balance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be only partially inside the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the balance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be attached to the rear end of a solid strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The modular features of the present invention further allow testing of various design configurations. Various secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and even various RP jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, may be quickly substituted during testing of a single primary model design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> All RP materials used in a model according to the present invention, including RP jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, may be built using any available RP technologies. These include fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, selective laser sintering, direct shell production casting, investment casting, solid ground curing, and other RP technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The reinforcement of the WTM provided by the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enables the generation of wind tunnel test data having test-to-test repeatability comparable to all-metal WTM&apos;s. The strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides increased stiffness to the final model and is therefore generally constructed from a high-strength material. Steel or aluminum are preferred materials because they are easy to machine; however, other materials including various other metal alloys and wood are also excellent candidate materials for the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the present invention the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be reusable so as to further decrease cost and timing requirements for new wind tunnel model designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Larger scale models may also be manufactured using the techniques of the present invention because there is no need for an entire wind tunnel model to fit inside of an RP fabrication machine, such as an FDM&reg; or SLA&reg; machine. The RP jacket section(s) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and components of the WTM may be fabricated separately and then assembled or attached directly to the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The following non-limiting example provides a detailed description of one embodiment of a wind tunnel model design of a rocket in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrate various views of a 15% scale rocket design according to the present invention. The rocket model was manufactured using FDM&reg;-ABS plastic jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attached to a cylindrical steel strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides strength and rigidity to the plastic model and also allows larger scale models to be built. The strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, fabricated from 304 stainless steel, is a 17.625-inch long cylinder with a 2.25-inch outer diameter and a 1.874-inch inner diameter. The surface of the cylinder has a surface finish of 32. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A balance adapter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was fabricated by the Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control-Dallas HSWT, which also performed the final honing of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inside diameter to achieve a zero tolerance fit between the balance adapter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The inner surface of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was only machined from one end to accommodate the balance adapter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The remainder of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is unfinished. Threaded screw holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for attachment of canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a faired inlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> were located in the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to meet model design requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The inside forward end of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was machined to a 2.125 inch diameter and threaded to accommodate a spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for attachment of the model nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is also fabricated of 304 stainless steel and has a 2.125-inch diameter threaded base for mating to the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a 0.5-inch diameter threaded spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for attachment of the ABS plastic nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The ABS plastic nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, faired inlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, launch lugs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and assorted filler blocks <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> were all manufactured using a Stratasys Inc. FDM-1650 machine. The machine has a 9-inch maximum limit on component length and a quoted manufacturing tolerance of &plusmn;0.005 inch. For the present 15% scale model, this tolerance scales to &plusmn;0.030 inch on the full-scale vehicle, which is comparable to a full-scale manufacturing specification. If the model had been limited to the maximum 9-inch length&mdash;as required by many prior art RP wind tunnel model designs&mdash;the same &plusmn;0.005-inch manufacturing tolerance becomes &plusmn;0.094 inch full scale, well in excess of the full-scale specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The RP parts were designed and solid geometry models were created using Pro-E design software and output as an .stl file. (This is an output option built into Pro-E.) The geometry information contained within the .stl file was then mathematically broken down into horizontal slices and transferred to the FDM&reg; machine for fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The FDM-1650 operates at high temperature to melt the ABS plastic. The material is fed into a temperature-controlled extrusion head, where it is heated to a semi-liquid state. The melted plastic comes out in an extruded string of hot liquid and paints an ultra-thin layer of plastic 0.010 inch thick onto a fixtureless base. The layers are built one on the other. The material solidifies, laminating the preceding layer. Because the plastic is hot and therefore very pliable, a supporting system was built underneath to support the prototype pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Because of FDM-1650 size constraints, the fuselage was built up as three jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> plus the nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter of the jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was chosen to be equal to the outer diameter of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because of shrinkage during fabrication, the inside of the jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> were lightly sanded to achieve a near-zero tolerance fit over the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The outer surfaces of the jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> were sanded to smooth the surface and remove the burrs that accumulate as the part is grown. The outer surfaces were then sprayed with an aerosol solvent (Sandfree&reg;) and wiped clean to produce a smooth clean surface. There are no attachments between the ABS fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each fuselage jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an interlocking tab <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to locate and attach it to the next jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> help hold the entire assembly together as well as improve the fidelity and roundness of the fuselage. Longitudinal and rotational position is maintained on the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via attachment of fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, faired inlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, or filler blocks <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for these secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Slots <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the individual fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allow the secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to attach directly to the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the threaded screw holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are incorporated into the design during the Pro-E geometry development and included in the .stl file description. As such, these geometry details are created as each jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is grown on the FDM-1650. Screw holes to attach launch lugs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> were drilled into the center and aft fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> after fabrication on the FDM&reg; machine. Helicoils <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 3</cross-reference> for attaching the nose, were inserted into the drilled holes to provide a threaded surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was created in the same fashion as the fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the exception that a hole was designed into a base section of the nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. After fabrication, the helicoil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> was inserted into the hole to provide a threaded surface for attachment to the spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The ABS launch lugs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> were all fabricated in the same manner as the fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> were small enough to allow them to be fabricated four at a time in the FDM&reg; machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition to the rapid prototype ABS fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, additional fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and other secondary aerodynamic components <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> were fabricated using the following processes: (a) infusing epoxy into the ABS components; (b) casting the components out of resin using a soft mold created from a specially prepared ABS component; or (c) stamping the components out of sheet metal and sheathing them in ABS plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (a) The epoxy-infused components were created on the FDM&reg; machine and surface sanded. They were then immersed in an epoxy bath and subjected to a vacuum to remove the air contained within the rapid prototype parts and replace it with the resin epoxy. The parts were then removed from the container, excess resin was wiped from the outer surface of the part, and the resin-impregnated part was allowed to cure. This results in a FDM&reg; rapid prototype plastic part that is less porous and has significantly greater mechanical properties than that of the original part. The final cured part was then sanded and wiped with the Sandfree&reg; aerosol solvent to provide the relatively smooth surface used in the wind tunnel test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> (b) The cast resin components were fabricated by first growing a master fin and canard in the FDM&reg; machine. These components were then sanded and treated with body filler to fill in surface pores and cracks. Next, a sandable primer paint was applied to coat the surface. The tail was then staged into clay to a break-away plane, using care to remove any excess clay from surfaces and edges. A release agent was sprayed on the tail and clay surfaces. A metal frame was constructed around the clay to contain the pouring of silicon resin. Once cured, the silicon mold was turned over and the other half was prepared with release agent and poured with silicon to mold the other half of the tail along the break-away plane. The removal of the rapid prototype tail left an internal cavity in the tail. With the use of some vent holes, a hypodermic needle was used to pressure fill the cavity with an epoxy resin. If high-pressure injection plastic casting is required, a hard tool mold can be made from the staged clay process by substituting a metal epoxy surface coat for the silicon. Thermalset plastics such as polycarbonates can also be used to make parts having higher strength and durability if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (c) The last process listed above for fabricating the secondary aerodynamic components used sheet metal as a reinforcing core. Hollow ABS plastic sheaths were fabricated in the FDM machine. The sheaths formed the aerodynamic surfaces and fit tightly over the sheet metal cores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> After all components were fabricated, the assembly of the model on the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> proceeded as follows: the forward fuselage jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was slid onto the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the aft end of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until only an interlocking tab <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> remained; the center fuselage jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was mated to the forward section via an interlocking tab <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the combined sections slid forward until only the center fuselage jacket section tab <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> remained off the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the aft fuselage/boattail jacket section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was attached via an interlocking tab <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the three combined sections translated forward to align the necessary holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the matching slots <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; finally, the nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the model was attached to the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by screwing the metal spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the forward end of the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then screwing the threaded ABS nose <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> onto the spindle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At this point the entire fuselage was completely assembled and the remaining components were added as needed. For the present model, several configuration options were available, with all the optional components attached using screws and common screw holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If the body-alone configuration were to be tested, the filler blocks <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> would be installed in lieu of the canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, inlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, etc. This creates a clean symmetric cone-cylinder configuration so that the model&apos;s symmetry characteristics may be quantified as a function of roll angle. If the &ldquo;full-up&rdquo; configuration was desired, the canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are installed using four screws per canard. These screws pass through the canard mounting pad and screw directly into the strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The fins <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and inlet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> attach in the same way. Because the launch lugs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are not subjected to large aerodynamic forces, it was satisfactory to screw them into the ABS fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using helicoil attachments <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In summary, as demonstrated in the above detailed example, the present invention provides for a rapid prototype wind tunnel model having improved strength and stiffness characteristics. Other advantages of the present invention include wind tunnel model designs that are less expensive and require significantly less time to build than conventional designs associated with the prior art. Also, designs according to the present invention may incorporate both RP components and conventional metal components, e.g., RP fuselage jacket sections <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and metal canards <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, so as to optimize cost, construction timing, and strength issues. Finally, the reinforcing strongback <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be reusable to further decrease costs and timing associated with a new wind tunnel model design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> While the above description contains many specifics, the reader should not construe these as limitations on the scope of the invention, but merely as examples of specific embodiments thereof. Those skilled in the art will envision many other possible variations that are within its scope. Accordingly, the reader is requested to determine the scope of the invention by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, and not by the specific embodiments given above. </paragraph>
