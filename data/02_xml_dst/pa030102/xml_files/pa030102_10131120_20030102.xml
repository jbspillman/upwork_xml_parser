<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a mechanism of elastic prop for reclining portions of office chairs and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As is known, office chairs generally have portions with adjustable height and/or inclination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In particular, they can be adjusted in the inclination of the back, and sometimes of the seat as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the latter case the seat can be wholly integral with the back, so that both can incline together of the same angle, or the seat can be only partially connected with the back so as to incline less than the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Chairs of the above-mentioned kind should normally be provided with mechanisms of elastic prop for reclining portions, which can exert on said portions reaction forces opposed to those developed against said portions by the user&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, said chairs usually consist of a primary body, for instance box-shaped, adapted to be engaged with an upper end of an upright defining a vertical stand for an office chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A support element of the back is turnably engaged with the primary body around an oscillation axis, so as to enable the adjustment of the inclination of said back. At least a support element of the seat of the chair is located above the primary body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The mechanism of elastic prop is generally placed between said primary body and said support element and comprises at least an elastic element with linear strain, such as for instance a cylindrical helical compression spring, having a main direction of development which is perpendicular to the oscillation axis of said support element and a first end which abuts against the primary body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the mechanism of elastic prop comprises means to transfer to the elastic element the pressing force pushing the back backwards, said means being placed between the support element and a second end of said elastic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In practice, in the known technique said transfer means normally consist of a part of the above-mentioned support element arranged outside said second end of the elastic element, so as to abut against said second end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The known technique, briefly disclosed above, is disadvantageous because it makes it necessary to place the elastic element in a given position, for instance in a position close to the front edge of the chair, since the above-mentioned second end of said elastic element should not be placed in such an inner position to be in contact with the pushing portion of the support element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In practice, the primary body of the chair does not often have a suitable front space which can house the group for the adjustment of the elastic force of the elastic element with linear strain and which can be easily handled from outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In some technical applications the length of the elastic element and the need to compress it on its ends makes it necessary to place it in an inclined, almost vertical position, thus giving rise to quite bulky and high primary bodies of the chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this situation the technical task of the present invention is to provide for a mechanism of elastic prop which can substantially obviate said disadvantages. Within said technical task an important purpose of the present invention is to provide for a mechanism of elastic prop for reclining portions of office chairs which enables the maximum freedom in the design of a wide range of technical solutions, allowing for instance to place the elastic element horizontally and/or in a withdrawn position with respect to the front edge of the seat or anyway in the position which is deemed as most suitable from a functional point of view, also considering the chair comfort and the easy handling of its adjustments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A final technical purpose of the present invention is to provide for a mechanism of elastic prop for reclining portions of office chairs which ca be easily carried out with limited costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The technical task and the purposes indicated above are substantially reached by means of a mechanism of elastic prop characterized in that it comprises one or more of the technical solutions claimed later.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With reference to the mentioned figures, the mechanism of elastic prop according to the invention is generally indicated with the numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Said mechanism is applied to an office chair comprising a primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adapted to be engaged with an upper end of an upright (not shown in the enclosed figures) defining the vertical stand of the chair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turnably engaged with a support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the back of the chair along an oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At least a support element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the seat of the chair is located above the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in the enclosed figures said support element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is hinged to the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to a first hinging axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located before the oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and parallel to it, and it is turnably engaged with the support element of the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on a second hinging axis <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> located behind the oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and parallel to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Moreover, said hinging axes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are substantially lined up, so as to enable the inclination, with respect to the primary body, both the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and, to a smaller extent, the seat engaged with the support element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid a three-hinge arch which would not enable the reciprocal inclination of said portions, it is necessary to carry out a slot <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>within which one of the hinging points defining the above-mentioned rotation axes can slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to provide to carry out, instead of the kind of chair disclosed above with synchronous inclination both of the back and of the seat, other kinds of chairs in which for instance also the second hinging axis <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is integral with the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and therefore with the fixed seat, i.e. in &ldquo;permanent contact&rdquo; with the latter, or in which the support element of the seat is integral with the support element of the back and the seat can therefore oscillate integrally with the back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The mechanism of elastic prop <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed between the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is integral with the back, and the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and it comprises an elastic element with linear strain <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, preferably a cylindrical helical compression spring. The latter has a main direction of development, i.e. its longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, lying on a plane which is perpendicular to the oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a first end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which abuts against the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, though not directly, but advantageously with the interposition of an adjustment group <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> increasing or reducing the reaction force exerted by the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as will be better described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the mechanism <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to transfer to the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the pressing force pushing the back backwards, said means being located between the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of said elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Said transfer means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprise in their turn a half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a hollow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>housing at least the portion of the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> starting from its second end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and at least a pushing extension <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> integral with the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Originally, said half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shows at least an abutment portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for the pushing extension <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which can place the application point of the pressing force exerted by the support element through said pushing extension, directly on the second end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, instead of placing it in an area far from the said end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In further detail, it is provided for two abutment portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>located in diametrically opposite positions on the half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the same number of pushing extensions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the abutment portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are placed outside near the entry of the hollow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, so as to exploit the whole length of the half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to move the action point of the force coming from the pushing extension <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> towards the first end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The adjustment group <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a reference element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> abutting against the first end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and moving along a direction of translation corresponding to the direction of the elastic strain of said elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, i.e. the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The reference element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is operated by control means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which can vary its position in order to change the compression on the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and thus its reaction force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The control means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> consist of a shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is turnably engaged with the primary body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> parallel to the oscillation axis <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and which can be operated by means of a handling knob <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> laterally projecting from the seat. A handling screw <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is coupled with the reference element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of a nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>integral with said element, and it develops along said direction of translation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The rotatory motion is transmitted from the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the handling screw <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by means of an oblique gear <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> consisting of a worm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> integral with the shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and of a helical toothed wheel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connected to said handling screw <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the handling screw <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> reaches on one side beyond the helical toothed wheel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to support a bearing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is placed between said wheel and the primary body to enable its low-friction rotation, and has on the other side an unthreaded stem portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>going through the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Said stem portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is slidingly coupled with the half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and has an end head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>constituting a stroke end for said half-shell element when the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is stretched and is not pressed by the pushing extension <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In practice, the stem portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>defines a guide for the translation of the half-shell element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal direction <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the elastic element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> during the axial deformations of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention shows important advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As a matter of fact, the mechanism according to the invention allows to place the elastic element it comprises in the most suitable position, for instance in order to leave suitable spaces to house the group for the adjustment of the reaction force of said elastic element, so as to simplify the operation of the handling knob it is provided with, since said knob can be arranged laterally with respect to the chair, in a comfortable position with an easy access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it should be pointed out that by suitably choosing the length of the half-shell element into which the elastic element is partially inserted, it is possible to locate the latter also horizontally if this is deemed as necessary to optimize the overall dimensions and the functional features of the mechanism as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Finally, it should be observed that the present invention can be easily carried out and that also the costs related to its implementation are not very high. </paragraph>
