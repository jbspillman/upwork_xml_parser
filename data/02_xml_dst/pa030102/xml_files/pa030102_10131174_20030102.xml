<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application relies for priority upon Korean Patent Application No. 2001-34185, filed on Jun. 16, 2001, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to devices for restoring data from signals transmitted through plural antennas, and more particularly to terminal-specific receivers usable in various features of base-station transmission diversities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As is presently known, CDMA 2000 as the third-generation cellular system is in need of a larger system capacity to transmit high-speed packet data as well as audio data. Such extension of system capacity confronts several obstacles involved in inherent properties of wireless communication systems. It is well known that the most important factor in mobile communication is to reduce &ldquo;fading&rdquo; that causes distortions of received signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In overcoming fading, it is preferred to employ diversity techniques. The diversity is generally used to combat multi-path fading, being applied on both the transmission and reception sides. There are essentially three kinds of diversity: time, frequency, and space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the CDMA 2000 system, a forward link governs system capacity because it has a smaller channel capacity than a reverse link, in contrast to the second-generation cellular system. Those conditions arise from the fact that the forward link is available to apply the maximal ratio coupling to a reception signal on the reception diversity employing two antennas at a base station. Since applying the reception diversity of two antennas burdens a terminal, the CDMA 2000 system employs the base station transmission diversity so as to balance the difference between channel capacities of the forward and reverse links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There have been proposed several kinds of transmission diversity techniques, such as OTD (orthogonal transmission diversity), TSTD (time-switched transmission diversity), STD (selection diversity), TXAA (transmission antenna array), and so on. It would not be apparent to discriminate superiority and inferiority between the diversity techniques about which one is capable of facilitating an optimal trade-off in view of functional enhancement in comparison with implementation complexity. It may be general to choose the best way among them in accordance with a given communication environment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a terminal-specific receiver adaptable to various environments of base station transmission diversity such as OTD, TSTD, STD, TXAA, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the above objects, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a data regeneration device. The device includes a plurality of despreading units for regenerating pilot and data signals by means of pilot and data Walsh codes; a path controller for selectively activating the despreading units; an antenna-waiting signal generator for creating an antenna-waiting signal using the pilot signals output from the despreading units; an adder for summing the data signals output from the despreading units; and a controller to control the path controller and the adder in accordance with a transmission scheme of a base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the despreading unit comprises a pilot integrator for synthesizing the pilot signals by despreading transmission signals with the pilot Walsh code; a data integrator for synthesizing the data signals by despreading the transmission signal with the data Walsh code; and a delay unit for delaying the transmission signal, which is applied to the pilot and data integrators, for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The data integrator outputs the data signal by multiplying the pilot signal by a despreading result of the transmission signal with the data Walsh code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Each of the despreading units can further include a path estimator for evaluating a phase and a gain of the pilot signal generated from the pilot integrator. Also, the antenna-waiting signal generator can output the antenna-waiting signal using an output of the path estimator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The despreading units are preferably to be composed of two in number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In applying the invention to a diversity mode, the despreading units are controlled to regenerate the data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same with each other and are twice the length of those for a single antenna. The path controller is controlled to enable all the despreading units, and the adder is controlled to alternately output the data signals regenerated from the despreading units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In applying the invention to another diversity mode, the despreading units are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same with each other and are the same length as those for a single antenna. The path controller controlled to alternately enable the despreading units in accordance with a predetermined pattern, and the adder is controlled to output data signals regenerated by one of the despreading units, in series, which is selected in accordance with the predetermined pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In applying the invention to still another diversity mode, the despreading units are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same with each other and are the same length those for a single antenna. The path controller enables all the despreading units, and the adder sums data signals regenerated by the despreading units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As a result, the present invention provides a terminal-specific receiver adaptable to various environments of base station transmission diversity such as OTD, TSTD, STD, TXAA, or so on.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a configuration of a terminal-specific receiver according to an embodiment of the invention. Referring firstly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the receiver has two despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a path or route controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an antenna-waiting signal generator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and an adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> control block (or a controller) to control the functional components is also included therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The despreading units, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, include: pilot integrators (or synthesizers), <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to synthesize (or integrate) pilot signals by despreading signals, which are transmitted from a base station by means of pilot Walsh codes P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding thereto; data integrators, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to synthesize data signals by despreading the transmission signals by means of data Walsh codes T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; a delay unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to delay transmission signals applied to the pilot and data integrators for a predetermined time; and multipliers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pilot Walsh code P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the data Walsh code T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are used for regeneration of pilot and data signals in the despreading unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, while the pilot Walsh code P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the data Walsh code T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are used for regeneration of pilot and data signals in the other despreading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The delay unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided to offset routing skews between antennas of the base station. The present embodiment utilizes the delay unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> only in the despreading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The data Walsh codes, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, are dependent on a kind of diversity mode. For instance, in the case in which the terminal-specific receiver is associated with OTD, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not equal and the controller (not shown) operates the despreading units, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to make the Walsh codes twice longer than those without diversity. On the contrary, in the conditions of TSTD, STD, and TXAA, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are identical and the length of Walsh code is the same as that with diversity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The multipliers, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, regenerate pilot and data signals by multiplying a signal from the base station respectively by the pilot and data Walsh codes P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Outputs from the multipliers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are applied to the pilot and data integrates, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, respectively. Synthesized pilot and data signals in the integrators, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, are multiplied at the multiplier <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. That is, a data signal restored (or regenerated) by a despreading operation with the data Walsh code is multiplied by a pilot signal restored in order to load a path characteristic on the data signal. In the despreading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the multipliers, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, regenerate pilot and data signals by multiplying the signal passing through the delay unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the base station by the pilot and data Walsh codes P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively, which performs independent from that in the despreading unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Outputs from the multipliers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are applied to the pilot and data integrators, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively. Synthesized pilot and data signals in the integrators, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are multiplied at the multiplier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, path or phase/gain estimators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are also provided in the receiver, being associated with the antenna-waiting signal generator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The path estimator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> evaluates a phase and a gain of the pilot signal generated from the pilot integrator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the despreading unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then applies a signal indicative of a path characteristic to the antenna-waiting signal generator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The other path estimator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the despreading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> carries out the same operation as the operation of path estimator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the pilot signal generated by the pilot integrator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The antenna-waiting signal generator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> checks out characteristics of transmission routes on the basis of outputs provided from the path estimators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and generates control information for adjusting power rates of signals transferred from antennas corresponding thereto. The control information returns to a base station, and the two antennas installed in the base station control power rates of the transmission signals. The control information is composed of one bit when the receiver is conductive in STD, while composed of multiple bits in TXAA. The antenna-waiting signal generator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is active in the condition of STD or TXAA. The STD and TXAA transmit messages of one bit and multiple bits, respectively, a base station through a feedback channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> alternately activates the two despreading units, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a present diversity condition. For example, the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are all active in OTD or TXAA. On the other hand, an alternate one of the despreading units is conductive in accordance with an intrinsic pattern associating antennas at a base station in TSTD, or in accordance with an antenna selection message in STD. Such an operation with the path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is regulated by the controller (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, for summing data signals generated from the despreading units, conducts a summing operation with the data signals in accordance with a present diversity condition. First, in OTD, data signals from the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are alternately rearranged and output from the adder. In TSTD or STD, a data signal from a selected one of the despreading units is just turned out of the adder. In TXAA, the adder generates a sum of data signals provided from the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Assuming that a length of the Walsh code in the case without the diversity techniques is N (N is a positive integer), the receiver of the invention conducts in the unit of N chips (or bits). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is preferably designed for the pilot and data integrators, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to receive a signal from one of the two antennas installed at the base station while for the pilot and data integrators, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to receive a signal from the other one of the two antennas. The reverse can also occur. The signals from the transmission antennas are demodulated, each being regarded as an independent one. That is, the pairs of the pilot and data integrators receive their own signals with independent pilots, and the signals each maintain their specific timing by means of independent time-tracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Operational features specified with the diversity modes are summarized in Table I below.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Operations of receivers in accordance with the diversity modes will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show functional configurations of a transmitter and a receiver, respectively, which are associated with OTD. OTD transmits signals, which are divided into two different bit streams of the channel-coded and interleaved, through individual antennas at the same time. Therefore, two antennas AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and AT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are always in use. Independent Walsh spreading codes are each assigned to the bit streams so as to render orthogonality on the bit streams. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, one of the two bit streams is composed of multipliers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a filtering/modulation (F/M) unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the other one is composed of multipliers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and filtering/modulation unit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A multiplexer (MUX) generates two types of signal: one is transmitted from the antenna AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after being multiplied by the pilot and data Walsh codes, P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on one of the bit streams; the other is transmitted from the antenna AT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after being multiplied by the pilot and data Walsh codes, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the other bit stream. The bit streams can be more segmented into larger numbers, e.g., three or four. Once a common pilot is applied to one of the antennas, e.g., AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the other antenna, e.g., AT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, cooperates with an auxiliary pilot. Assuming that the length of Walsh code is N, the length of the Walsh codes T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes 2N in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the OTD receiver shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, symbol data signals that are individually demodulated through the segmented bit streams are arranged in a demultiplexer (DEMUX) <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and an output of the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is applied to a combiner. At this time, the length of the data Walsh codes T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 2N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In applying the present receiver of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, into the OTD mode, the two despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are different from each other, with the length of 2N that is twice that with a single antenna. The path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> enables all the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> alternately outputs the data signals regenerated from the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a control mechanism by a controller makes the receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operable in the OTD mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> show configurations of a transmitter and a receiver, respectively, in the TSTD mode. In the TSTD mode, only one of antennas AT<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and AT<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is usable, although with the same Walsh codes thereon. As in the OTD mode, when a common pilot, e.g., P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is associated with one of the antennas, the other antenna is associated with an auxiliary pilot. Assuming that a length of a Walsh code is N at a non-diversity mode, the length of a data Walsh code T in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> becomes N. A switch SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> permits users to alternate between the two antennas by means of irregular specific patterns. The irregular specific patterns shall be designed to secure half users on an average to use a single antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The receiver shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> employs the same data Walsh code T with the length of N. Switches SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> allow users to alternate between the two antennas by means of irregular specific patterns. The irregular specific patterns are preliminarily provided into a mobile station by information exchange with the base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In applying the present receiver of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, into the TSTD mode, the two despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same from each other, with the length of N that is identical to that with a single antenna. The path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> enables all the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with specific patterns that are used in selecting the antennas at the base station, and the adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> outputs a data signal of a selected one of the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a control mechanism by a controller makes the receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operable in the TSTD mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show configurations of a transmitter and a receiver, respectively, in the STD mode. The STD is proposed to enhance a function of the TSTD that is short of obtaining the best condition of SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) all the time at a receiver of a terminal. With an ideal case, the best performance of a receiver can be present if an antenna with the maximal SNR of reception at a terminal is selected by means of a switch SW<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, it is practically impossible because there is no way to detect a status of a mobile communication channel at a base station. Since there is a feedback channel from a terminal to a base station, it is available to enhance an operational function with displaying an antenna, which is the one securing a higher SNR, on a terminal. At this time, the terminal offers antenna information to the base station by means of a one-bit antenna selection message, considering a channel capacity of a forward link. A speed in selecting an antenna heavily influences STD performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the length of a data Walsh code T is N. Switches SW<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and SW<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are operable in accordance with an antenna selection message that is transferred to the base station from an antenna selector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The antenna selection message is conductive, not directly applied to the switches, after round-trip delays and processing times in the base station and terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In applying the present receiver of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, into the STD mode, the two despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same from each other, with the length of N that is identical to that with a single antenna. The path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> selects the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with the antenna selection message. The adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> outputs a data signal of a selected one of the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a control mechanism by a controller makes the receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operable in the STD mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show configurations of a transmitter and a receiver, respectively, of the TXAA mode. The TXAA mode transmits the same data signals through two antennas, AT<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and AT<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, by means of the same Walsh codes. There occurs a waiting step with antenna information that arrives through a feedback channel from a terminal before the transmission. Assuming that the length of Walsh code without diversity is N, a data Walsh code T of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> has the length of N. The values of H1(t) and H2(t) are established by the antenna-waiting signal transmitted from a terminal through the feedback channel. The values of H1(t) and H2(t) adjust phases and gains of signals transmitted through the antennas to be the maximal SNR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, as the same data signals are transmitted through the two antennas, AT<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and At<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with the same Walsh codes, the TXAA receiver sums the two-way results at an adder <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and then the summed result is applied to a combiner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In applying the present receiver of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, into the TXAA mode, the two despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are controlled to regenerate data signals by means of data Walsh codes, which are the same from each other, with the length of N that is identical to that with a single antenna. The path controller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> enables all the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the adder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> sums data signals regenerated by the despreading units <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such a control mechanism by a controller makes the receiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operable in the TXAA mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention provides one receiver system for a mobile terminal to be adaptable to various environments of transmission diversity with base stations, such as OTD, TSTD, STD, or TXAA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
