<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a power supplying apparatus and method for a plurality of electric loads remote from a power supply, and also to a semiconductor circuit apparatus and an intensive wiring apparatus for transmission of control information for use with the power supplying apparatus and method. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a conventional power supplying apparatus for a vehicle, a power supply carried on the vehicle and each of several electric loads are connected to each other by a long power supply line with a fuse interposed therein. When a power supply line is short-circuited, the fuse is blown to disconnect the electric load from the power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In control of electric loads of a conventional vehicle, a so-called multiplexing wiring system is known wherein controllers for individually controlling a plurality of electric loads are integrated into a smaller number of controllers having a communication function and a calculation function so that control signals for the electric loads are calculated by the smaller number of controllers and the control signals are transmitted to terminal equipments connected by communication lines to control several electric loads connected to each of the terminal equipments (refer to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,771,382, 5,113,410, 4,855,896 and 5,438,506). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, power supply lines are usually wired from a power supply directly to individual electric loads or to driving circuits for the electric loads, and the number of power supply lines is equal to or larger than the number of electric loads and the floor or the inside of the body of a vehicle is full of wiring lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, basically it is a principle object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying apparatus for a vehicle. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to reduce power supply lines of a power supplying apparatus for a vehicle. It is another object of the present invention to eliminate a fuse. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying method. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a novel semiconductor circuit apparatus for use for supplying power. It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel intensive wiring apparatus integrated with a power supply control system. It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel power supplying apparatus for a particular electric load of an automobile. It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a novel apparatus for detecting short-circuiting of a power supply line. The objects recited above are solved by different solving means disclosed hereinbelow or in the appended claims. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, since two power supply lines are led out from one of poles of a power supply such that power can be supplied from both of the power supply lines to electric loads, a novel power supplying apparatus wherein, even if one of the lines is short-circuited, supply of power can be maintained from the other line can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, since an electric switching apparatus for controlling connection and disconnection between a power supply line and an electric load is provided in a relay circuit provided between the power supply line and the electric line such that, when the power supply line is short-circuited, the switching apparatus is operated to disconnect the electric load from the circuit, a fuse can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention, since power transmission lines of a closed loop are formed from power supply lines connected to one of two poles of a power supply such that power can be supplied from the opposite sides of a connection point of an electric load so that, even if short-circuiting or disconnection occurs with one of the transmission lines, supply of power can be continued from the other side of the transmission line, the number of electric loads which are rendered uncontrollable by a failure of a transmission line can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a still further aspect of the present invention, since a network is formed from power supply lines similar to communication lines to construct a multiplexing wiring system which can handle both of control signals and power, also the power supply lines are aggregated and the number of electric wires can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a yet further aspect of the present invention, since power supplying apparatus for electric loads for an air conditioner control unit, a power train control unit, a lamp control unit, a navigation unit, an anti-lock braking control unit, a window opening and closing motor control unit, a display circuit control unit for an instrument panel, a rear defogger controlling unit, a beacon control unit and so forth are formed from a novel power supplying apparatus of the present invention, those electric loads in an automobile can be controlled with a reduced number of wiring lines.</paragraph>

The FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have communication means <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to communicate data between different modules, and input/output interfaces <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to which sensors, switches and external electric loads are connected, but, in the present embodiment, do not have an arithmetic processing unit (CPU). (Naturally, they may have an arithmetic processing unit (CPU)). As multiplexed communication lines along which data are communicated between different modules, a line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to extend from the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to extend from the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> while a line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to extend from the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the multiplex communication lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle. The other modules, that is, the IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, A/C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are connected branching from individually near locations of the lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> arranged in a loop. In this manner, since each module is disposed in the proximity of a device connected to the module and input data and output data of any device which is not connected to the module are transmitted or received via the multiplexed communication lines, the necessity for connection of the module to a device located remotely by a wire in order to acquire data necessary for the module is eliminated, and consequently, wiring lines for signal transmission, that is, harnesses, can be reduced. A power supply line from the battery <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by a power supply line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via the fusible link <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and connected by a power supply line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the BCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, by another power supply line <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> between the BCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and by a further power supply line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> between the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and is disposed in a loop in the vehicle compled with the multiplexed communication lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which are modules which must operate irrespective of an ON or OFF position of an ignition key switch <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are connected branching from near locations of the power supply lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> arranged in a loop so that electric power may be supplied to them. From the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, power is supplied via a power supply line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to the modules, actuators and so forth of the PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted in the engine room. From the BCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, power is supplied to the A/C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and actuators and sensors mounted in the compartment by power supply lines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Further, from the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, power is supplied to the beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and actuators and sensors mounted in the trunk room by a power supply line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Since the power supply lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle and the modules to which power is inputted from the power supply lines wired in a loop and which supplies the power to the different modules, actuators, sensors and so forth are disposed one by one in the engine room, the compartment and the trunk room (since, in the present embodiment, they are formed from the FIM, BCM and RIM, respectively), such a situation that power supply lines are wired in multiples in the vehicle is eliminated, and wire harnesses in the vehicle can be further reduced. </paragraph>

The I/O communication ICs built in the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> have respective unique physical addresses and are each constructed such that it fetches, when an address signal same as the physical address of the I/O communication IC appears on the communication lines, a signal following the address signal, outputs the signal to the I/O interface, then outputs input data from an electric load connected to the I/O interface to the communication lines, and, if a change appears in the electric load connected to the I/O interface, then transmits a function address representing contents that &ldquo;input data from an electric load to the I/O interface are transmitted&rdquo; first and then outputs input data of the I/O interface to the communication line. Since the communication function is restricted in the manner, a module construction which does not require a CPU can be used. A module having this I/O communication IC is generally referred to as LCU (Local Control Unit). The communication ICs built in the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, A/C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are constructed so that control of transmission and reception is performed by a CPU. In particular, also the timing at which transmission is to be started and the transmission data are controlled by a signal from the CPU, and not only reception according to the physical address peculiar to the CPU but also a function address can be discriminated by the CPU to fetch or ignore data following the function address. In the following, operation is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As an example, a case wherein the P/W raising switch on the passenger&apos;s seat side mounted on the door on the driver&apos;s seat side is depressed to raise the P/W on the passenger&apos;s seat will be described. If the P/W raising switch on the passenger&apos;s seat side mounted on the door on the driver&apos;s seat is depressed, then the level of a signal of the passenger&apos;s seat P/W raising switch inputted to the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> changes from high to low. This variation in input acts as a trigger, and the I/O communication IC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> starts transmission of all input data connected to the I/O interface <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and outputs a signal to the communication lines. The signal outputted includes information representing transmission of the input data of the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the actual input data. The information outputted to the communication lines is inputted to all of the modules. However, the I/O communication IC ignores following data since the information does not present the physical address of the I/O communication IC. The CPUs of the modules in which communication ICs are built are programmed so that they individually discriminate their function addresses and the communication ICs other than that of the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ignore following data. The BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> fetches the input data of the DDM outputted from the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and performs discrimination calculation processing based on the data. Whereas this discrimination calculation processing may be performed immediately after the data are received, in the present embodiment, it is executed after each fixed interval of time. Since the P/W motor for the passenger&apos;s seat is changed from stopping to driving based on a result of the discrimination calculation processing, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputs the physical address of the PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the passenger&apos;s seat P/W motor, whose output should be changed, to the communication lines and then transmits output data to all of the actuators connected to the PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Whereas the signal on the communication lines outputted from the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is inputted to all of the modules, only the PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> whose physical address coincides with the signal receives the data. The PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs the received data to the I/O interface <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to drive the actuator. In this instance, since the signal of the P/W motor is ON, the P/W motor operates to raise the P/W. According to such a communication procedure as described above, the P/W of the passenger&apos;s seat can be raised by depressing the P/W raising switch on the passenger&apos;s seat side mounted on the door-of the driver&apos;s seat. It is to be noted that, though not shown, where the vehicle is a four-door vehicle, four P/W rolling up switches are provided for the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and also four P/W rolling down switches are provided. In this manner, input data to the LCU are all inputted to the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> calculates, based on the input data, control data for driving of all of the actuators connected to the LCU and transmits the control data by communication to the LCU. Since calculation processing for the control objects of the LCU is all performed by the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in this manner, the LCU can be constructed such that it does not require a CPU which performs calculation processing. Between those modules which include a CPU, transmission and reception between the modules based on a physical address and simultaneous transmission and reception between a plurality of modules based on a functional address are performed. As an example, vehicle speed data are described. A vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>A is connected to the PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>) so that a vehicle speed is detected by the PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> outputs a functional address representing contents that vehicle speed data are outputted to the communication lines and then outputs the vehicle speed data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Since the LCU cannot receive a functional address, it cannot fetch vehicle speed data. Each of the modules which require such vehicle speed data (in the present embodiment, the navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) discriminates the functional address and, if it discriminates that vehicle speed data are transmitted, receives following vehicle speed data and reflects the vehicle speed data on its respective control. In the present embodiment, the output of the LCU cannot be controlled directly from any module other than the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which includes a CPU. All information necessary to control the LCU is inputted to the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the output of the LCU is controlled by the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a state transition table of operation. The state A is a state wherein the battery is disconnected and all of the modules are unpowerwd. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The state B is a state wherein those modules to which power is always supplied while the battery is connected (in the present embodiment, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) are operative, but power is not supplied to the other modules. The state C is a state wherein those modules to which power is supplied in the state B stand by for operation, that is, sleep. The state D is a state wherein the ignition key switch is at the accessory position (hereinafter referred to as ACC) and the modules to which power is supplied in the state B are operative and besides power is supplied to those modules to which power is supplied when the ACC is ON (the navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the A/C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a radio and so forth which are not described in the present embodiment) so that the modules are operating. The state E is a state wherein the ignition key switch is at the ignition position (hereinafter referred to as IGN) and the modules to which power is supplied in the state B are operative and besides power is supplied to those modules to which power is supplied when the IGN is ON (in the present embodiment, the PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) so that they are operating. If the battery is connected in the state A, then the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> start their operation. The I/O interfaces of the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, PDM <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, RRDM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, RLDM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, IPM <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, DSM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and PSM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are put into a high impedance state which is an all port initial state, and the I/O communication IC is put into a standby state. The BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits, after the initialization of the CPU <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and I/O interface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, input/output directions of the I/O interfaces of all of the LCUs and initial output data to the LCUs from the communication lines to effect initialization of all of the LCUs. Thereafter, input data to all of the LCUs are received and ordinary control is entered. In this state, if some operation is performed, control corresponding to the operation (for example, door locking control) is performed. If, in this state, no operation is performed for more than a predetermined time (in the present embodiment, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> seconds) and the state wherein all outputs are off continues, then the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> discriminates that the vehicle is in a state left as it is and executes a procedure of entering a sleep state of the state C. First, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputs a sleep command at least once to the communication lines so that all of the LCUs may enter a sleep state. Each of the LCUs having received the sleep command stops an oscillation circuit of the I/O communication IC or the like to enter a sleep state. The BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereafter puts itself into a sleep state. Consequently, the state C is established. If wake-up requirements are satisfied in the sleep state of the state C, then the system now enters the state B, in which it starts its operation. The procedure of the wake-up is such that, when an input to an LCU changes, then the communication IC of the LCU varies the potential of the communication lines, and if the variation of the communication line is detected by the communication IC of the BCM, then the communication IC generates a wake-up signal to the CPU and the CPU starts its operation to operate the communication IC. Then, a wake-up command is transmitted from the communication IC to all of the LCUs to wake up, and the communication IC starts its operation. All of the LCUs start their operation in response to the wake-up command. As an example, when the vehicle is in a state left as it is, that is, when the system is in the state C, if a driver of the vehicle inserts a key into a key cylinder of a door and unlocks the door, then the input to a door unlock detection switch connected to the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> varies, and in response to the variation, the system wakes up in the procedure described above and enters the state B in which its starts its ordinary operation. Or, according to another wake-up procedure, when an input signal connected directly to the BCM varies, then a wake-up signal for the CPU is generated in response to the signal of the variation and the CPU starts its operation to render the communication IC operative. Thereafter, the communication IC transmits a wake-up command to all of the LCUs so that they may wake up to start their operation. All of the LCUs start their operation in response to the wake-up command. Transition from the state C to the state B occurs in this manner. If the ACC is turned on when the system is in the state B, then the system enters the state D. If the ACC switch connected to the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is switched on, then the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> starts supply of power from the power supply &amp; switching Circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the navigation control module <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the A/C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and, though not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, those modules, sensors and actuators to which power is supplied when the ACC is on such as a radio. Further, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits a control signal via the communication lines so that power may be supplied from the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to, though not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> CD changer and so forth. The RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which receives the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. If the IGN is switched on when the system is in the state B or the state D, then the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> starts supply of power from the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the module of the SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, sensors, actuators and so forth. The module to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) starts its ordinary operation after it performs initialization. Further, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits a control signal via the communication line so that power may be supplied from the power supply &amp; switching circuits <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, respectively. The FIM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having received the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to the line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The modules to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the PCM <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the ABS <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) start their operation after they individually perform initialization. Similarly, the RIM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having received the control signal starts supply of power from the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The module to which power is supplied (in the present embodiment, the beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) starts its ordinary operation after it performs initialization. If the IGN is switched off, then transition from the state E to the state D occurs, and if the IGN is off and the ACC is off, then transition from the state E to the state B occurs. The requirement for transition from the state D to the state B is that the ACC is switched off. Transition to the state A occurs from any other state if the battery is disconnected. Since power supply of the entire vehicle is managed by control signals by multiplexed communication from the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and modules from which power is supplied are disposed in the proximity of modules, sensors and actuators to which power is supplied in this manner, the length of the power supply lines can be made short. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view showing an internal construction of a power supply line and a multiplex communication line. In the present embodiment, a structure of a two core braided cable which includes a power supply line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) for supplying power and a multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) as well as a shield layer SA which forms a short-circuiting sensor is taken. In the following description, the structure is referred to as composite multiplex communication cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z. The composite multiplex communication cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z is different from an ordinary shield cable in that a potential is applied to the shield layer. Since a predetermined potential is applied via a terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, if the composite multiplex communication cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z is rubbed against or pinched by the vehicle body to break a insulating resin protective sheath <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B, the shield layer is first brought into contact with the vehicle body and the potential thereof drops to the ground (vehicle body ground). Therefore, by supervising the potential, a sign of occurrence of a short-circuiting accident of the power supply line can be discriminated. Further, where the shield layer is connected to the ground with a low impedance using a capacitor, there is an effect also for prevention of invasion of external noise of high frequencies or of emission of high frequency noise. Further, where the shield layer is made of a metal, since it is difficult to cut, there is an effect also for assurance of time until a short-circuiting accident of the power supply line occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The composite cable is disclosed in detail in Japanese Patent Application No. 07/32647. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of BCM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a detailed block diagram of the BCM (body control module). This module is disposed in the neighborhood of the dash panel, and principally performs fetching of switches operated by a driver, supply of power to other control units installed in the proximity of the dash panel and control as a center of the power supply network using a power supply multiplex communication line which will be hereinafter described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> An actual controlling method is hereinafter described with reference to a flow chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected via composite multiplex communication cables <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z to nine modules for effecting power supply management, including the FIM (front integration module) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which effects power supply management of a front part of the vehicle, the DDM (driver door module) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which effects power supply management of the door on the driver side, the PDM (passenger door module) which effects power supply management of the door of the assistant &amp; driver side, the RLDM (rear left door module) which effects power supply management of the rear door on the driver side, the RRDM (rear right door module) which effects power supply management of the rear door on the driver&apos;s seat side, the IPM (instrumental panel module) which effects power supply management of the meter panel of the instrument panel forwardly of the driver&apos;s seat, the RIM (rear integration module) which effects power supply management of a rear part of the vehicle, the DSM (driver&apos;s seat module) which effects power supply management of the driver&apos;s seat and the PSM (passenger seat module) which effects power supply management of the seat of the passenger&apos;s seat side, and is the center which controls the modules in a concentrated manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, only the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a built-in microcomputer among the modules. It is to be noted that the reason why a microcomputer is built only in the BCM is that the system can be constructed at a low cost, but a microcomputer may otherwise be built in all of the modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected at an input terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A thereof to the composite multiplex communication cables <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z which form a loop. Consequently, the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the two composite multiplex communication cables <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z, and the two communication lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are logically Ored via internal communication lines <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and inputted to the communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> so that multiplex communication is performed. The reason why the communication lines <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are logically ORed is that it is intended to prevent disconnection or short-circuiting of one of them from having an influence on the other of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> A potential signal of the shield line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C is inputted to a short-circuiting detection circuit <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> via internal signal lines <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, and a state signal of the shield line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C is inputted from the short-circuiting detection circuit <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to the CPU <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, by which it is used for means for detection of a trouble of the composite multiplex communication cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Details of the short-circuiting detection circuit <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the present embodiment, the short-circuiting sensor shield line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C interposed between different modules is fixed to a potential of 2.5 V, which is equal to one half a voltage Vcc (5V), by resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serves also to restrict electric current to flow when the short-circuiting sensor is short-circuited. Reference character S denotes a comparator, and a Schmitt circuit is formed from resistors R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The threshold level of the Schmitt circuit is set to a voltage lower than 2.5 V so that, when the potential of the short-circuiting sensor is lower than the threshold level, the comparator S may output &ldquo;H&rdquo;. Accordingly, when the output signal of the short-circuiting detection circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;H&rdquo; the potential of the short-circuiting sensor is low. In short, this indicates that the short-circuiting sensor is in contact with an element having a low potential, and after all, this indicates that the composite multiplex communication cables are damaged and contact with the vehicle body ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The power supply lines are distributed by internal power supply lead-in lines <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> to a path inputted to a power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and another path <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> logically ORed by diodes and inputted to a power supply circuit <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>. The path which passes the diodes is used so that, even if switches in the inside of the power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> are completely off, supply of power to a microcomputer <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> or the communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may not be cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is controlled in accordance with a power supply switching signal <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> by the CPU <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and is a circuit which switches to select one of the internal power supply lead-in lines <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> to be used. The power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is provided in order that, even if one of the two power supply multiplex communication cables is damaged and put into a state wherein it fails to supply power, this may not have an influence of the other power supply multiplex communication cable. By this means, even if short-circuiting of a power supply multiplex communication cable to the vehicle body ground occurs, the damaged portion can be opened between the power supply switching circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Situations in which power supply switching is required and states of the change-over switch are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Further, an actual state is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in order to facilitate understandings, notice is taken of the power supply switching circuit to show it in an enlarged form. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a state of the power supply switching circuit when the power supply multiplex communication cable between the FIM and the BCM is short-circuited to the vehicle body ground, and the switch B on the FIM side is switched off while the switch A on the BCM side is switched off so that the circuit of the power supply line at the location at which the power supply multiplex communication cable is short-circuited to the vehicle body ground is shut-off and no current flows any more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> A power supply circuit <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>) has two power supply input paths as described hereinabove, and details of the same are described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>). The power supply circuit <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>) receives two inputs of power supply from a power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>) and a path <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>) described above. The internal circuit has two independent circuit constructions and includes, as common circuit blocks, a power supply reverse connection protection circuit which prevents a break of the circuitry even if the battery is mounted with the (&plus;) terminal and the (&minus;) terminal thereof connected reversely, a surge protection circuit for protecting the circuitry from a high voltage which is generated when a battery terminal is disconnected during driving of the vehicle or in a like case, and a low-pass filter for suppressing a sudden variation of the battery voltage. Battery power from the power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>) having passed through those circuits is used as a voltage source <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>) for driving loads connected to the individual modules which effect power supply management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The power from the path <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>) thereafter passes a power instantaneous disconnection compensation circuit which prevents interruption of power supply to the control circuit even if power supply disconnection for a short time which arises from chattering of a connector or a terminal occurs and then passes a control circuit driving power production circuit in the form of a constant voltage power supply circuit which produces power for the control circuit (in the present embodiment, 5 V), and is used as driving power for the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The power supply line <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> outputted from the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is inputted to a control unit supply power switching circuit <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> and an interruption circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. The control unit supply power switching circuit <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> is a switching circuit which supplies power to the other control units connected to the BCM, and is switched on and off by a control signal line <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, each of various control units employed in current vehicles (for example, a PCM, an ABS and so forth) has, in the inside thereof, a power supply protection circuit which prevents failure of the control unit even if the battery voltage becomes an abnormal voltage. Since this circuit is similar to that of the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, if a power supply module is used to supply power to various control units as in the present invention and the power supply protection circuit is built in on the power supply side, then it is possible to omit power supply protection circuits from the control units to which power is to be supplied. In other words, if the number of various control units to which power is to be supplied is large, then the cost can be reduced as much as the power supply protection circuits can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in the present embodiment, when an accessory ACC contact <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> of the key switch is on, power is supplied to the navigation unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and further, when an ignition ON contact <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> of the key switch is switched on, supply of power to the SDM <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the air conditioner unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is started. Reference symbol ST denotes a starter starting switch of the key switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The cut off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is provided in order to cope with two situations described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> First, the cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is used in order to reduce the current consumption of a driver <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>A built in an output interface <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> when it is not used. The driver used in the present embodiment is formed from a driver called IPD (intelligent power device) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In this IPD, short-circuiting or disconnection of a load to be driven is diagnosed by a diagnosis circuit <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>C and a result of the diagnosis is outputted to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The diagnosis circuit <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>C includes a protection circuit which detects, when over-current flows through an element <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>B, such over-current and controls a driving signal <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to limit the current so that the diagnosis circuit <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>C itself may not be broken. Consequently, the current consumption (dark current) when the element <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>B is inoperative is higher than that of an ordinary driving element. Accordingly, use of a large number of such drivers may possibly cause exhaustion of the battery. In order to prevent this, when the driver <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>A need not be driven, power to be supplied to the driver <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>A is cut-off on the upstream side to prevent consumption of current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Second, the cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is provided for protection against a failure of the driver <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>A itself. In particular, when the cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> supplies power to its load although a driving signal is not received from the CPU <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, while it is conventionally impossible to stop the power supply, in the present embodiment, an cut-off signal <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the c/o circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is cut-off to cut-off power, which is to be applied to the driver, on the upstream of the driver to stop supply of power to the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> A detailed construction of the cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The cut/off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> includes a switching device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A for which a semiconductor such as an FET is used, and a state detection means <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>D for monitoring an on-off situation of the switching device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A. The switching device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A is normally on in accordance with the cut-off signal <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Also when the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> detects a trouble of the switching device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A from the monitor signal from the state detection means <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>D, the driving signal <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disappears and the switching device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A is switched off. Operation of the device <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A is indicated in Table 2.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As described above, the IPD, the element itself, has a function of discriminating a state of a load connected thereto, and as seen in Table 3, a &ldquo;load open&rdquo; and a &ldquo;load short-circuited&rdquo; can be discriminated from the relationship between the diagnosis signal and the driving signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the IPD element itself fails, then also the diagnosis signal cannot be relied, and therefore, an output signal of the IPD is monitored as an element diagnosis signal as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. An impedance converter A and a resistor R have a function of preventing an electric influence on the IPD and another function of stabilizing the signal level when the element failure diagnosis signal is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> This circuit monitors a voltage applied to the room lamp <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (load) after all, and by monitoring the three of the driving signal, diagnosis signal and element diagnosis signal, all states indicated in Table 3 can be grasped. In Table 3, the portion indicated by &ldquo;-&rdquo; (dash) represents whichever one of &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo; is allowed. Accordingly, if the driving signal is &ldquo;H&rdquo; and the diagnosis signal is &ldquo;H&rdquo; while the failure diagnosis signal then is &ldquo;L&rdquo;, it is indicated that, although it is discriminated that the output state of the IPD is correct, no outputting is performed. On the other hand, when the driving signal is &ldquo;L&rdquo; and the failure diagnosis signal then is &ldquo;H&rdquo;, it is indicated that no outputting is performed irrespective of the discrimination that the output state of the IPD is normal although the IPD is not driven. Further, when the driving signal is &ldquo;L&rdquo; and the failure diagnosis signal then is &ldquo;H&rdquo;, outputting of the IPD is performed although the IPD is not driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In this instance, since both of the two cases are in abnormal states, it may be determined that the IPD is in failure. Then, when such a situation is entered, a secondary accident can be prevented by notifying to a driver of the vehicle or the like by sound or by an alarm lamp or the like that a trouble has occurred and by switching off the switching element <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>A of the cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. A number of such drivers <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> A equal to at least the number of electric loads connected to the output interface <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> are provided in the output interface <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> An input interface <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> is an aggregate of waveform shaping circuits for discriminating which one of the switches <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> connected to the BCM is on. The internal circuit of the input interface <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The reason why only one circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is that the other circuits are omitted because all of the circuits are the same, and actually, a number of same circuits equal to the number of switches are built in the input interface <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>. Each of the switches is pulled up to a battery voltage (power supply line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) by a resistor R<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thereafter, it passes a low-pass filter formed from a resistor R<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the high voltage side is clamped by a Zener diode Z<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In short, when the switch is off, &ldquo;H&rdquo; is outputted, but when the switch is on, &ldquo;L&rdquo; is outputted. Those signals are inputted to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> via an input signal line <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that switches connected to the input interface <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> of the BCM include two switches for generation of left and right signals for turn switches to be used for declaration of turning to the right and the left, two light switches for lighting side marker lamps and headerlamps, and three switches of the accessory ACC switch <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight>, the ignition power supply switch <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and a switch <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> for turning on the engine starter motor, which are controlled by the key switch. In the embodiment, an automatic antenna motor <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> and a wiper motor <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> are further connected to the output interface <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> of the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> An automatic antenna switch <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>, a wiper switch <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>, a speed changing resistor <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a out side near view mirror control switch <highlight><bold>637</bold></highlight> are connected to the input interface <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Since power supply lines are wired in a loop in the vehicle and control units such as a BCM and an FIM for controlling electric loads are connected to intermediate portions of the power supply lines or to power supply lines branching from the power supply lines so-that power is supplied from the power supply lines of the control units to terminal electric loads, there is no need of laying a plurality of power supply lines long to each control unit and there is an effect in reduction of power supply lines. Further, since they are integrated with data mwltiplexing wiring system, also information of a large number of operation switches can be fetched collectively, and since shorter wire harnesses to the switches can be used by transmitting the switch information by the data communication lines, saving of wires can be achieved. It is to be noted that the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (indicated by dotted lines) formed between the connector section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A of the BCM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the output interface <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> and output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B can be regarded as a power supply relay circuit. Then, the BCM itself can be regarded as one of power supply relay terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of FIM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the FIM which is disposed at the front part of the vehicle and effects power supply management of the front part of the vehicle. The FIM is basically different from the BCM in that it does not include a microcomputer nor an input interface circuit and consequently in that the signals inputted to and outputted from the microcomputer in the BCM are inputted to the communication IC <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the FIM controls two groups including a group which effects supply of power to the ABS control unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the ABS solenoid <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and effects supply of power to the PCM control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the fan motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for an engine cooling radiator and the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the engine, and another group which effects driving of the horn <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, headerlamps <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, clearance lamps <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and front turn signal lamps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Since the FIM does not fetch an input signal, the input interface provided in the BCM is eliminated from the FIM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> For the communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> used for the BCM and the communication IC <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> used for the FIM, communication Ics of different types are used. The former is of the type which cannot perform data communication unless it is used together with a microcomputer while the latter is of the type which can perform data communication-even if it is not used together with a microcomputer. While details of the communication IC <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the latter are hereinafter described, if data communication is allowed without using a microcomputer in this manner, a unit of an object of communication is not necessary required to have a microcomputer built therein, and consequently, there is a merit in that reduction in cost is allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> A short-circuiting detection circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and a switching circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a power supply circuit <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, an cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, a switching circuit <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and an output interface <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> which form the power supply &amp; switching circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> have same constructions as those of the BCM described above, and accordingly, description of them is omitted. Further, details of operation are hereinafter described with reference to a flow chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of DDM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a power supply module built in the inside of the driver side door. The door has a movable hinge element, and it is difficult to assure a space in which a wire harness is to be wired. Therefore, the present embodiment has a construction wherein, avoiding to wire the composite multiplex communication cables in a loop, the DDM is connected to a single composite multiplex communication line SZa branched by a T-shaped branching connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> does not adopt such a power supply switching circuit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> as is adopted by the BCM or the FIM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Basically, an cut-off circuit <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>, an output interface <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> and an input interface <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> have similar constructions to those of the BCM or the FIM, and the DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is characterized in that a power supply circuit <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> has a simplified construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Details of the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Since the power supply circuit <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> does not adopt a power supply switching circuit, power supply is not cut-off completely, and consequently, the two power supply paths, which are independent of each other in the BCM, are joined together while a driver driving power supply is branched from between a low-pass filter and a instantaneous power supply disconnection compensation circuit. Since the other circuit construction itself of the power supply circuit is He same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, description of the same is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The DDM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> principally includes a switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for operating the power window P/W, a switch <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for operating the door lock, and a switch <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>A for detecting whether or not the door is in a locked state. Also a motor <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>A for driving a out side Rew view mirror <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is connected to the output interface <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>. A control switch for the motor <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>A is connected to the input interface <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> of the BCM. It is to be noted that switches <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for operating the door lock are switches provided only for the driver side, and by operating this switch, all of the door locks can be operated collectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> General operation is hereinafter described with reference to a flow chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of PDM, RRDM and RLDM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the power supply modules built in the insides of the doors other than the driver side door. In this instance, the power supply modules signify the PDM built in the inside of the passenger side door, the RRDM built in the inside of the rear right door and the RLDM built in the inside of the rear left door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Those modules have basically the same construction as that of the DDM, but are different in that dialing up and down switches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>) for the power window and a door lock sensor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>) are connected to an input interface <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> and the door lock motor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the P/W motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) are connected to an output interface <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that a out side rear view mirror motor <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>B is connected to the output interface only of the PDM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of IPM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the IPM installed in the inside of the driver&apos;s seat meter panel. The IPM is a module which effects fetching of an input signal which cannot be inputted to the BCM and drives various display lamps and alarm lamps installed in the meter panel. In the present embodiment, a parking brake switch <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, a foot brake switch <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight>, a trunk open switch <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> and so forth are connected to an input interface <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and, as display lamps and alarm lamp for headerlamps, stop lamps and sofreth, an SDM alarm lamp, an ABS alarm lamp, malfunction indicator lamps for the composite multiplex communication cable and so forth are connected to an output interface <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Also the present module has basically the same circuit construction as that of the DDM, but it is different only in the apparatus which are connected to the input interface and the output interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of RIM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the RIM disposed in the rear part of the vehicle. The RIM has a construction similar to that of the FIM and is a power supply module which drives electric loads concentrated in the rear part of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the RIM drives a trunk opener motor <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> , tail lamps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, stop lamps <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and turn signal lamps <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Further, the beacon <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the RIM from a power supply circuit <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> via a power supply line <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a switching circuit <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the control panel, display unit and loudspeaker for guidance by voice are connected to an I/O interface <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the beacon unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Since the constructions of the internal blocks are same as those of the circuitry of the FIM except that no input interface is provided, description of them is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of DSM and PSM&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is an internal block diagram of the DSM and the PSM disposed in the proximities of the driver&apos;s seat and the passengers seat, respectively. Each of the DSM and the PSM employs motors in order to adjust the position of the seat (forward and backward sliding positions, forward and backward reclining positions and the height), and switches for such adjustment are provided at portions of the seat. Further, the respective switches are connected to the input interfaces of the DSM and the PSM and the respective motors are connected to the output interfaces of the DSM and the PSM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> As described above, since power supply modules connected by power supply paths are disposed together with control units to which power supply is required or disposed in the proximities of locations where electric loads to be driven are concentrated, a plurality of power supply lines to a control unit or power supply lines to electric loads can be integrated, and besides, since the lengths of the power supply lines can be made short, there is an effect in saving of power supply lines. Further, where the power supply lines are integrated with an intensive wiring system, by collectively fetching information of a large number of operation switches and sending the switch information to the data communication lines, short wire harnesses can be used also for wire harnesses to the individual switches, and consequently, saving of lines can be achieved. Further, since a semiconductor is used for a switching device for controlling power supply to an electric load to form the switching device as an intelligent switching device and besides an cut-off circuit is provided, also when the electric load is short-circuited, the device can be prevented from being broken. As a result, there is a merit in that a fuse box for the vehicle and fuses for individual electric loads can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of Connector&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> By the way, for such a module as the BCM or the FIM to which two composite multiplex communication cables each integrated with a power supply line are inputted, a connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>W shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is used. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, when a module is to be connected to the wiring side connector SW, a dummy connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>X is removed, and instead, a terminator of the module is inserted to establish connection. Same reference symbols as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> denote same members. For such a module as the DDM or the PDM to which one composite multiple communication line is inputted, such a branching connector as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is used. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, when power supply lines for a module are to be branched from the power supply lines, the power supply lines are separated and wiring connectors are connected to ends of the power lines and inserted into two terminals of the T-shaped branching connector while wiring connectors on the module side are inserted into the remaining one terminal of the T-shaped branching connector to establish connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of Additional Module&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, in recent years, a consumer having purchased a vehicle frequently attaches a car audio set, a navigation apparatus or a like apparatus, and if a additional terminal by which a power supply module can be added is provided in the proximity of the passenger&apos;s seat dash panel of a vehicle or in the trunk room in order to cope with such a need as just mentioned, then supply of power can be performed readily and safely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Where two power supply multiplex communication cables are required, a dummy connector called terminator is connected to a additional connector of the type of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> to form a loop, and when to use, the terminator is removed and a connector of a power supply module of the BCM type is inserted instead. Meanwhile, where it is considered that one power supply multiplex communication cable may be used, a T-shaped branching aditional terminal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is inserted, but when not in use, a cover is attached to the module connection side terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> A additional module is higher in universality and can have variations in accordance with applications where it has a built-in microcomputer. For example, a additional module which itself has alarm sound or an alarm lamp, another additional module for an audio application which includes a reinforced noise filter, a further additional module which has a burglary prevention function, a still further additional module which has a function of an engine starter and so forth may be available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> An internal block diagram of a additional module which includes one composite multiplex communication line is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. The additional module shown is much different from that of the DDM or the like in that it has a built-in microcomputer. Since the module for extension employs a microcomputer, it is programmed so that the microcomputer effects all control such as control of signals from input/output interfaces, signals of a short-circuiting detection circuit and an interruption circuit. Further, since the module for extension can be programmed for exclusive use therefor, finer control is possible. For example, where an additional module is supplied for an engine starter, a state of a door lock, a situation of a gear position, a starting situation of the engine and so forth can be acquired from the BCM or the PCM by data communication, and cut-off of power supply or the like when the function as an engine starter is not required can be achieved readily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> &lt;Description of General Operation&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the following, operation of the power supply network for a vehicle is described with reference to flow charts and so forth. First, in order to facilitate understandings, input and output information to and from the individual power supply modules are described with reference to data tables of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 26</cross-reference>. It is to be noted that the input and output tables are formed from 4 bytes (2 bytes for the input and 2 bytes for the output) for each power supply module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows data tables of data which are fetched as input signals by the individual power supply modules. Those tables are written in a freely readable and writable random access memory (hereinafter referred to as RAM) which is built in the microcomputer of the BCM. For example, in the case of the BCM, the table includes the position of the key switch, the position of the light switch and two kinds of diagnosis information of the room lamp, and if the ignition key switch is set to the ACC position (position for accessory power supply), then the bit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the BCM of the RAM table is set (changed to &ldquo;1&rdquo;), but if the ignition key switch is set to the ON position, then the bit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the BCM is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In the case of the FIM, the table-includes diagnosis information inputs of the side marker lamps la and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are lit when the light switch <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the BCM is positioned to the position of a POS <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> (lighting of the side marker lamps). It is to be noted that diagnosis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and diagnosis <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denote the diagnosis signal and the element diagnosis signal shown in Table 3, and short-circuiting detection (1) and short-circuiting detection (2) are used to indicate distinction of one of two power supply multiplex communication cables which is inputted to the FIM. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, how the functions of the present invention operate when a battery is connected to the vehicle is described in order with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating operation of the power supply network after a battery is connected. If a battery is connected first in step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then power is supplied, in step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to the communication ICs and the microcomputers which are the internal circuits of the BCM and the power supply modules (hereinafter referred to as LCUs). This power is different from the power to be used for supply of power to the electric loads and is normally supplied to the BCM and the LCUs. This power is, for example, in the BCM, the control circuit power supply <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> When power is supplied to the microcomputer of the BCM, initialization processing of the microcomputer is performed in step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thprocesses processes which is necessary for any product which employs a microcomputer, and processes to set the microcomputer to enable use of the input and output ports of the microcomputer, to clear the RAM and to make preparations for use of the functions of the microcomputer. Then in step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, preparations for transmission of initialization data to all of the LCUs connected to the BCM are performed. Here, the switch situations of the power supply switching circuits of the LCUs are all switched on to make preparations for power supply to the electric loads and connection units. In step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the BCM fetches a switch input situation and a trouble situation from any of the LCUs connected thereto. In step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the processing in steps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is repeated until it is completed for all of the LCUs connected to the BCM. Since initial information necessary to start control is all acquired by completion of the processing up to step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, processing execution start completion is set in step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The foregoing is contents of processing executed without fail when a battery is connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> After step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is executed, ordinary control in step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is performed.

<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, processing when the power supply network is not used is described. In the present invention, when the system need not function, in short, when there is no need of supplying power, in order to minimize discharge of the battery, power supply to the electric load driving circuits of the LCUs is cut-offed and the communication ICs and the communication IC <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the microcomputer of the BCM are put into a low current consumption mode (sleep mode). First, in step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is checked based on the output tables of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> whether or there is an electric load which is in operation. If some electric load is outputting, then the processing returns to step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in which the processing is repeated. However, if no electric load is outputting, it is checked in step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based on the input tables of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> whether or not some electric load is planned to operate. If some switch is on or a trouble has occurred, then the processing returns to step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> similarly. However, if no switch is on or no trouble has occurred, then in order to cut-off power supply to the electric loads of the individual LCUs, a signal for switching off a power supply switching circuit and a switch switching circuit is set to the output tables in step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, transmission of the set data is waited, and after the transmission is completed, the microcomputer enters a sleep mode in step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that, if operation of some switch is performed in this state, then the microcomputer is released from the sleep mode, and the processing is repeated again beginning with step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> First, in step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is checked whether or not the microcomputer has been in a sleep mode, and if the microcomputer has been in a sleep mode, then since this signifies that the entire system is in a low power consumption mode, sleep cancellation processing is executed in step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Here, a sleep cancellation signal is sent to the communication ICs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of all of the nine LCUs so that processing of returning the entire system to an ordinary state is executed. If the microcomputer has been released from a sleep state, then the processing advances directly to step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in which it is discriminated from address information of a signal received just now from which LCU or unit the data has been received. If the data has been received from an LCU, then a data storage address of the input table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is calculated in step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. If the data has been received from a unit, then a data storage address of the unit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is calculated similarly. Then, in step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the received data is stored into the object address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the processing of discriminating, based on an address of received data, from which module or unit the data has been received and storing the data into a corresponding table is the processing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> and is used also for cancellation of a sleep mode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Since the processing in steps <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used for the same object as that of the P/W control described hereinabove, description of the same is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> First in step <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the input table for the IPM is checked, and if the &ldquo;trunk open&rdquo; signal is set in step <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, then the &ldquo;trunk output&rdquo; of the transmission table for the RIM is set in step <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to make preparations to supply power to the motor for unlocking the trunk.

<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In the following, the communication control system used in the present embodiment is described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and Tables 4 to 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The I/O communication IC effects transmission of a digital input signal via a communication bus to a control module which includes a CPU. Further, the I/O communication IC effects on-off control of a digital equipment via the communication bus from the control module. By the way, a plurality of I/O communication ICs are connected to the communication bus. Therefore, each of the I/O communication ICs has such functions as described below-which prevent interference of data communicated between the I/O communication IC and the control module. First, the communication ICs connected to the communication bus have respective unique numbers which do not overlap with each other, and transmission data include input/output data and the unique number of the apparatus which transmits the data. Second, each of the I/O communication ICs has a communication bus supervision function to prevent collision between data from a plurality of apparatus, and effects transmission when the communication bus is not used by any other communication IC. Further, if a plurality of units start their communication, then based on priority order data included in data, that unit which exhibits the highest priority order is allowed to transmit data to the communication bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The I/O communication IC effects transmission in the following two cases. One of the two cases is that a digital input signal connected to it exhibits a variation, and the other is that a transmission request is received from the control module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Further, the I/O communication IC receives data and sets the data to the output ports only when data on the transmission bus are analyzed and the data are destined for the I/O communication IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> A circuit construction of the I/O communication IC is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. Functions of the I/O communication IC are divided into transmission, reception and transmission-reception timing controlling functions. First, a method by which the I/O communication IC transmits an input signal is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In transmission, if a transmission request is received, then the I/O communication IC confirms that the communication bus is not used by any other unit and transmits digital data to the communication bus in accordance with a prescribed format. The data format includes header data, digital input data and data check data. If a transmission request is received, then an input signal is set from a digital I/O port to an I/O register. If the communication bus can be used, then data are set to a Tx register in order of the header register, receive address register, transmit address register, I/O register and CRC generator. The data set to the Tx register are inputted to a VPW generator, by which they are variable pulse width (VPW) modulated, and are then transmitted to the communication bus. The VPW modulation method is a method wherein digital data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo; are transmitted with two different pulse widths and two different voltage levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> According to this modulation method, when data being transmitted at present and the next bit are the same data, both of the voltage level and the pulse width are varied, but when they are different, only the voltage level is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Here, in the header register, characters of following data such as priority order data of the unit are set in advance. In the receive address register, address data (the apparatus number) of another unit which is to receive data transmitted is set, and in the transmit address register, the transmission apparatus number, that is, the apparatus number of the unit, is set. The CRC generator is a circuit which performs CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) from the header register to the I/O register. Here, the CRC calculation is one of methods of error detection which are performed in data transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In the following, a method by which the I/O communication IC receives data from the communication bus and set the data to the output port is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Data on the communication bus are inputted to a VPW decoder after noise components are removed therefrom by a digital filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The VPW decoder converts, reversely to the VPW generator, a VPW modulated signal to digital data of &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The digital data obtained by the conversion are inputted to an Rx register, and contents-of the headerer register and the receive register are compared with the apparatus number and so forth of the I/O communication IC to discriminate whether or not the data on the communication bus have been destined for the I/O communication IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> If it is discriminated that the data on the communication bus are destined for any other unit, then the following reception operation is not performed. When the data on the communication bus are destined for the I/O communication IC, the following Rx register is set to the I/O register. Then, when the OK output of the CRC check circuit becomes true, the contents of the I/O port are set to the output port. When the OK output of the CRC check circuit is false, a receive error is outputted to notify the transmission side that a receive error has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Here, the transmission and reception timing control of the communication IC is performed by a scheduler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The scheduler is formed from a status registor, a stage counter, a byte counter and so forth. The status register is a register which represents a status of the communication IC (transmitting, receiving, transmission-reception error or the like). The stage counter is a register which represents a time series state during transmission or reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Here, when data are to be transmitted to the communication bus, in addition to the data from the header data to the CRC data, a special signal different from a data signal (VPW signal) representative of a start and an end is added. The start signal is called SOF (Start Of Frame), and the end signal is called EOD (End Of Data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The stage counter is a register which represents one of the states of the SOF, data, EOD and no data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The byte counter is a counter which represents which data the transmit or receive data (from the header data to the CRC data) are. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> In addition, the communication IC circuit includes a clock generator which generates a signal. Here, signal lines connected to the communication IC include, in addition to the communication bus line and the digital input/output signal line, apparatus number, priority order signal and input signal number (or output signal number) lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Basic operation of the communication IC has been described in outline so far. The communication IC has, in addition to the operation for ordinary transmission and reception, a sleep operation mode in which those circuits which operate in response to a clock signal are stopped to suppress the power consumption to a level substantially equal to leak currents of the semiconductor elements. Transition into the sleep mode occurs depending upon transmission data from the communication bus or when the digital signal does not exhibit a variation for more than a fixed period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Transition from the sleep mode to the ordinary operation mode occurs when communication data are sent to the communication bus or when a variation occurs in the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> In the following, detailed operation of the communication IC are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Communication ICs are divided into two kinds including an I/O communication IC and a C/U (Control Unit) communication IC. The I/O communication IC effects interfacing between a digital input/output and a communication bus, and C/U communication IC effects interfacing between a communication bus and a CPU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Both communication ICs have apparatus addresses (apparatus numbers) which do not overlap with each other and effect data communication with each other. An example of addresses of the communication ICs connected to the communication bus is indicated in Table 4. Here, the example is shown wherein the address is indicated by 1 byte and the upper 4 bits represent an address for identification of a control function while the lower 4 bits represent a number for identification of a communication IC in the same control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Here, any address whose number of the lower 4 bits is <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> represents a C/U (Control Unit) communication IC. The unit whose number of this is <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> has a function which can work data of the same control system. In the other units, the bit construction of data transmitted or received and the digital input/output ports correspond in a one-by-one corresponding relationship to each other, and the units have no editing working function.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In the address of the C/U communication IC shown in Table 4, 1x: PCM (engine control system), 2x: ABS (brake control system), 3x: BCM (body control system, 4x: SDM(Air Bag System), 5x: A/C (air conditioner), 6x: navigation system), and 7x: beacon. Meanwhile, in the address of the I/O communication IC of the BCM system, 30: BCM (Body Control Module), 31: PDM (Passenger Door Module), 32: DDM (Driver Door Module), 33: RRDM (Rear Right Door Module), 34: IPM (Instrument Panel Module), 35: DSM (Driver Seat Module), 36: RIM (Rear Integrated Module), 37: PDM (Passenger Door Module), 38: RLDM (Rear Left Door Module, and 39: FIM (Front Integration Module). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Further, an example of input signals and output device signals of the BCM (body control system) connected to the BCM, IPM and FIM is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> By such addressing, an outline of functions of an apparatus can be discriminated from its address, and understanding of the functions, analysis of an error and so forth can be performed readily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Here, an example of operation when the left turn signal is turned on is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> If the turn SW LH at 09 connected to the BCM at the address 30 is put into an on-state (when the left turn signal is turned on), then the turn SW LH processing program at 09 incorporated in the BCM is started. This processing program is transmitted from the BCM of the data at the output number 11 at the address 34 by which the TRN-L lamp is lit to the IPM, and also the output 08 of the FIM at the address 39 is transmitted from the BCM to the FIM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In particular, if the driver operates a winker knob on a steering column apparatus to turn on the left turn signal switch, then one of the turn signal lamps on the front face of the body blinks and also the left turn signal lamp on the instrument panel blinks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Next, power supplying operation of the ABS and the PCM is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> The output 00 of the communication IC of the FIM is connected to the switch switching (2), and the output 01 is connected to the switch switching (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the switch switching (2) performs on/off control of the power supply line to the ABS, and the switch switching (1) performs on/off control of the power supply line to the PCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> In particular, supply of power to the ABS and the PCM is performed when the output signal of the FIM is 00 and 01. Meanwhile, on/off of the output signals 00 and 01 of the FIM is performed by the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the CPU of the BCM can perform power supply control to the ABS and the PCM grasping states of apparatus connected to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the data format transmitted between the communication ICs is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> shows different kinds of the data format transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> The transmission data format has six kinds of 1. initialization, 2. ordinary transmission, 3. diagnosis request, 4. diagnosis response, 5. data transmission request, and 6. sleep start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Here, the common format among the formats includes the SOF, receive address, transmit address, format ID, data, CRC data and EOD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> The directions of input/output ports of a communication IC can be set arbitrarily. Therefore, the initialization format performs setting input/outputs from a CPU to an I/O communication IC by inputting to or outputting from the ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, when power supply to a communication IC is on, the ports of the communication are set to input ports. Setting data are bit data corresponding in a one-by-one corresponding relationship to the individual ports, and &ldquo;1&rdquo; represents an output port, and &ldquo;0&rdquo; represents an input port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Transmission data from a CPU to an I/O communication IC upon ordinary transmission are output data to the I/O ports corresponding in a one-by-one corresponding relationship to the individual ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Here, data to the input ports are ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, transmission data from the I/O communication IC to the CPU are input data to the I/O communication IC, and data of the output ports are data being outputted at present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> From this, confirmation of output data can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The diagnosis request and the diagnosis response are based on the SAE1979 diagnostic message format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> The data transmission request is transmitted from the CPU to the I/O communication IC and has no part for data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Also the sleep start is transmitted from the CPU to the I/O communication IC. If this data is received by the I/O communication IC, then the I/O communication IC stops a clock signal and enters a low power consumption mode. It is to be noted that data transmission between CPUs is different from transmission between an I/O communication IC and a CPU, and contents of data of individual bits are determined uniquely between different CPUs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, variation of the operation state of a communication IC is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> shows a state transition table of a communication IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The communication IC has the following <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> different states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The states are: 1. no transmit/receive data, 2. data being transmitted, 3. start of data transmission, 4. waiting for re-sending, 5. production of transmission data, 6. data being received, 7. data transmission by the other modes, 8. retrieval of receive data, and 9. sleep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> The state 1 is a state wherein no transmission data is present on the communication bus and there is no data to be transmitted and consequently a change is waited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> If input data exhibits a variation, then the state 5 is entered and preparations for transmission are performed, and then the state 3 is entered and data transmission is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> In the transmission, SOF header data is transmitted to the communication bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> Here, if also another communication IC transmits simultaneously, then if the priority order data in the header data from the first-mentioned communication IC is higher than that from the second communication IC, the first communication IC continues its transmission and enters the state 2. data being transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> On the contrary if the priority order data is lower, then the first-mentioned communication IC enters the state 4. waiting for re-sending. When the state of waiting for re-sending is entered, the communication IC waits until the second-mentioned communication IC completes its transmission, and repeats the transmission starting procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> In reception, if data appears on the communication bus, then the communication IC first receives the SOF, header data and receive address data. Then, if the receive data coincides with the address data of the communication IC itself, then the communication IC receives also following data. Then, if the result of CRC checking is OK, then the communication IC sets the received data to a predetermined port. However, if the receive address data is different from the address of the communication IC itself, the communication IC stops its receiving operation ignoring following data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Here, when the receive data is the sleep start data, generation of the clock signal is stopped, and the low power consumption mode is entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Transition from the sleep mode to the ordinary mode is performed either when a variation occurs with the input signal or when data appears on the communication bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, an example of transmission of data between the BCM, DDM and PDM is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> is a time chart of the data transmission. Here, the addresses of the individual units are: 30 for the BCM; 31 for the PSDM; and 32 for the DDM. The priority data are the same as the address data, and the priority order is given in a descending order of the address number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> The state numbers and the transmission data generation signal illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> are those of the DDM. The data 1 on the communication bus is data when a transmission request is produced by the DDM and data is transmitted from the DDM to the BCM. The data 2 is data transmitted from the BCM to the PDM, and is not received by the DDM. The data 3 is data transmitted from the BCM to the DDM and received by the DDM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> When DDM transmission data is generated during the reception by the DDM or when, though not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>, another transmission request is produced by the SDM, the DDM starts its transmission after waiting until completion of the reception of the data 3, but also the SDM starts transmission simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> If it is discriminated, after starting of the transmission, that the SDM has a higher priority during transmission of the header data, then the DDM stops its transmission and waits for re-sending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> Here, the data 4 is transmission data from the SDM to the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> The data 5 is transmission data from the DDM, which is waiting for re-sending, to the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> The foregoing is transmission/reception operation of data by a communication IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> shows a circuit portion of an I/O communication IC which relates to transmission of data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> is a time chart of the circuit portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> When the I/O communication IC is in a communication enabled state, if a transmission start signal is generated, then data is transmitted to the communication bus in accordance with a prescribed time sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> When the I/O communication sequence is in a communication enabled state, a communication bus busy flag of the status register is in an off state. Transmission is started when a transmission request flag of the status register changes to an on-state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> If a transmission start signal is inputted, then the stage counter, byte counter and bit counter of the schedule counter are rendered operative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> An output of the stage counter is inputted to the VpW generator. The stage counter outputs a stage clock (S&middot;Clock) signal, a data clock (Clock&middot;Out) and transmission data (Data&middot;Out) in synchronism with a clock signal &phgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> The VPW generator outputs an SOF signal, data and an EOD signal in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Based on the calculated value of the byte counter, the header register, receive address register, transmission address register, I/O register and CRC generator are successively selected in this order, and the data are set to the transmission register(Tx register). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> The data of the Tx register is inputted to and VPW multiplexed by the VPW generator in response to the Clock-Out signal of the VPW generator and transmitted to the communication bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> Here, the number of bytes of the I/O registor is 4 bytes as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> The bit clock signal for the transmission data is controlled by the bit counter. Here, the values of the headerer register, receive address and transmission address registers are set to initial state values from an external input signal or from some other communication IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Further, the data of the CRC generator are calculated with data from the headerer data to the I/O data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> A detailed circuit of the CRC generator is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> A circuit construction of the schedule counter is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>. This circuit is formed from a bit counter, a byte counter and a stage counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> The bit counter is a circuit which divides the frequency of the data clock signal of the VPW to &frac18;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> The byte counter is a shift register which receives the bit counter as a clock signal thereto, and outputs of the byte counter are connected to select terminals of the registers in an order of transmission thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> The stage register is a shift register which receives the stage clock signal of the VPW generator or the CRC output as a clock signal thereto, and an output of the stage register is connected to the VPW generator. A time chart of the schedule counter described above is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the VPW generator is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference> shows a circuit construction of the VPW generator, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> is a time chart of the VPW generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> The VPW generator is a circuit which generates signals of several different pulse widths to be used by the different communication ICs. The pulse width to be generated is different among the SOF, data, EOD and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> The pulse signal is generated by setting a suitable value to an 8-bit presettable down counter based on output data of the stage counter of the scheduler. </paragraph>

A control module <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> receives various sensor signals necessary for control of the engine and the driving system (in the present embodiment, the automatic transmission) and outputs driving signals for various actuators in accordance with a predetermined control method. An air flow sensor <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> measures an intake air flow amount of the engine, converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. A water temperature sensor <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> detects the temperature of the engine coolant, converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. An O2 sensor <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> detects the concentration of oxygen in exhaust gas, converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. A knock sensor <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> detects a knocking state of the engine, converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. An exhaust gas temperature sensor <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> detects the temperature of a catalyzer for exhaust gas purification, converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. An A/T fluid temperature sensor <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> detects the temperature of control fluid of the A/T (Automatic transmission), converts it into an electric signal and outputs the electric signal. A crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> detects a crank angle and outputs a pulse signal, for example, for each one degree. A vehicle speed sensor <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>A outputs a pulse signal corresponding to rotation of a wheel. A power steering switch <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight> detects a rise of the hydraulic pressure when the power steering apparatus is driven. This switch is provided to increase the idling speed of the engine when the power steering apparatus is used upon idling. A shift inhibitor switch <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is a switch provided corresponding to a position of a shift control lever of the A/T and detects a shift position. An ignition system <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> includes an ignition plug and an ignition coil of the engine and ignites the ignition plug in response to an instruction of the PCM <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. An injector <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> is a fuel injection valve for injecting fuel in response to an instruction of the PCM <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. An A/T solenoid valve <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> controls the hydraulic fluid pressure of the AT in response to an instruction of the PCM <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to effect shift control. A cooling fan <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> is a fan for cooling the radiator and operates in response to an instruction of the PCM <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. An air conditioner compressor <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> is controlled in operation in accordance with an instruction of the PCM <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in response to an operation state of the air conditioner and an acceleration state of the engine. A power supply line <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> is part of the power supply network of the present invention and supplies power of the PCM itself from an FIM <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> and supplies power to the loads <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> described above.

The sensors <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> described above provide analog input signals, and the analog input signals are inputted to an analog input interface <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, by which they are converted so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full scale) with which they can be processed readily by a CPU (Central Processing Unit). Output signals of the switches <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and the crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> described above are digital signals and are converted by a digital input interface <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full scale) with which they can be processed readily by a CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> converts the aforementioned analog signals into digital signals by means of A/D converters and fetches the digital signals into the inside of the CPU. Similarly, the digital signals mentioned above are fetched into the inside of the CPU from digital input ports via a digital input interface. Three power supplies are used including power to be supplied to the upstream side of each load, power to be supplied to a constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight> for a communication IC <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> in the PCM and power to be supplied to a constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1027</bold></highlight>, the digital input interface <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> and an output interface <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> via a power supply cut-off switch <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight>. The constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight> is a constant voltage power generation circuit for exclusive use for the communication IC and is normally powered unless power supply from the FIM is cut-off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> The present circuit can be formed readily from a three-terminal regulator. The constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1027</bold></highlight> supplies power to the CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> and the analog input interface <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. The power supply cut-off switch <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight> is controlled directly by the communication IC and is provided in order to cut-off power supply when a trouble occurs with a grounded type load (to which the air conditioner compressor <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> corresponds in the present embodiment). The circuit has such a detailed construction as described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The communication IC <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> is connected to the multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> via a communication IC interface <highlight><bold>1023</bold></highlight>. Further, the communication IC <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> is connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> and effects transmission and reception of data to and from the power supply network via the multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>. Detailed description of functions of the communication IC <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> and the communication IC interface <highlight><bold>1023</bold></highlight> is such as described hereinabove, and it is omitted here. The CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> includes a ROM (Read Only Memory) and a RAM (Random Access Memory) provided in the inside thereof, and control software for the PCM and initial constants are stored in the ROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, as loads to the PCM, the injector <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> (solenoid load), the ignition system <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> (coil load), the AT solenoid <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> (solenoid load), the cooling fan motor <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> (motor load) and an air compressor clutch (solenoid load) are presumed, and signals between the output interface <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> and the CPU <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> include driving signals and state detection signals of the individual loads mentioned above. Details of the signals are described below. </paragraph>

In the present embodiment, this driving circuit is applied to the injector <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, ignition system <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>, AT solenoid valve <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and cooling fan <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. A load <highlight><bold>1033</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of an N-channel type FET (low side driver) <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight>.

A state detection signal <highlight><bold>1031</bold></highlight> monitors the voltage of the drain to which the load <highlight><bold>1033</bold></highlight> is connected. The state detection signal exhibits, based on the state of the load driving signal, such values as indicated in the following table (in this table, VB is the battery voltage, VDS is the voltage between the drain and the source of the FET, and RL is the dc resistance of the load (where r&gt;&gt;RL)).

Since the IPM is provided to control elements relating to the instrument panel, switches and alarm lamps around the driver are distributed. A defogger switch <highlight><bold>1043</bold></highlight> and an OD (Over Drive) switch <highlight><bold>1044</bold></highlight> provide input signals relating to the PCM. In order to raise the idling speed of the engine when the rear defogger is turned on, a state of the defogger switch is transferred from the IPM to the PCM via the BCM. The OD switch <highlight><bold>1044</bold></highlight> is used to turn on or off of the over drive of the automatic transmission, a state of it is transferred similarly to the PCM. An exhaust gas temperature alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1049</bold></highlight>, an engine alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> and an OD off lamp <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight> are incorporated in the meter panel, and driving data thereof are transferred individually from the PCM to the IPM via the BCM. </paragraph>

In the present embodiment, a fuel pump <highlight><bold>1048</bold></highlight> built normally in a fuel tank and positioned remotest from the PCM is controlled by the RIM <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. A control signal of the fuel pump <highlight><bold>1048</bold></highlight> is sent from the PCM to the RIM via the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference> shows a conventional example of a PCM system construction and illustrates a wiring line reduction effect by the present invention. Since an ignition switch signal is fetched by the BCM and transmitted by multiplex communication, wiring lines for a starter switch <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight> and an ignition switch <highlight><bold>1047</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Since power is supplied from the FIM to the PCM and an over-current state of the PCM is supervised by the FIM, fuses <highlight><bold>1045</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1046</bold></highlight> on the upstream can be reduced. Simultaneously, the necessity for wiring a power supply line from the battery to the PCM via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated, and the wiring line can be reduced as much. The power supply line for backing up the battery is eliminated by transferring data necessary for backing up when power supply to the PCM is cut-off to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described. Since signals of the exhaust gas temperature alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1049</bold></highlight>, engine alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, OD off lamp <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight>, defogger switch <highlight><bold>1043</bold></highlight> and OD switch <highlight><bold>1044</bold></highlight> are transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as described hereinabove, the necessity for wiring individual lines to them is eliminated, and the wiring lines can be reduced. Since a signal of an air conditioner switch <highlight><bold>1042</bold></highlight> is transferred from an air conditioner control unit which is hereinafter described to the PCM by multiplex communication, the wiring line for it can be reduced similarly. An engine rotation pulse signal <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> is produced by the PCM and transmitted to the other control units by multiplex communication. The vehicle speed pulse signal is produced by the ABS control unit and transmitted to the other control units by multiplex communication. Since also a self diagnosis <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> is executed by multiplex communication, wiring lines for it can be reduced similarly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</cross-reference> illustrates a basic control flow of the PCM of the present invention. After power supply is made available by the FIM, processing is started from a reset state <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight>. After such resetting, the processing advances to initialization processing <highlight><bold>1091</bold></highlight>, by which initialization of the entire system is performed. Then, the processing advances to engine control processing <highlight><bold>1092</bold></highlight>, in which engine control such as fuel injection and ignition is performed based on input information of the various sensors. Thereafter, the processing advances to AT control processing <highlight><bold>1093</bold></highlight>, in which speed changing control is performed based on the input signals from the sensors similarly. Then, the processing advances to self diagnosis processing <highlight><bold>1094</bold></highlight>, in which self diagnosis of the sensors and actuators in the system is performed. Then, the processing advances to transmit data writing processing <highlight><bold>1095</bold></highlight>, in which data to be transmitted from the PCM to another control unit are written into the communication IC. In discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1096</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the ignition key switch is in an off-state, and if the ignition key switch is in an off-state, then the processing advances to ending processing <highlight><bold>1097</bold></highlight>, but if the ignition key switch is in an on-state, then the processing advances to the engine control processing <highlight><bold>1092</bold></highlight>. In the ending processing <highlight><bold>1097</bold></highlight>, transfer processing of backup data is performed.

By backup data transmit requesting processing <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>, a transfer request for the backup data backed up by the BCM is transmitted. This is performed by setting and transmitting the operation OK bit of the PCM transmission data as described hereinabove. By discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1123</bold></highlight>, contents of the initial value data transferred are discriminated. When the backup data are not normal such as when the BCM itself fails in backing up and stored data are destroyed or when the backup data cannot be transferred because of failure in operation of the BCM, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight>, in which the ROM data in the PCM are adopted as initial values. When the transfer data are normal, the backup data are read in by processing <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>.

Since an ignition switch signal is fetched by the BCM and transmitted by multiplex communication, wiring lines relating to the ignition switch <highlight><bold>1047</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Since the SDM receives supply of power from the BCM and an over-current state of the SDM is supervised by the BCM, fuses <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> on the upstream can be reduced. Simultaneously, the necessity for laying power supply lines from the battery to the SDM via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated, and wiring lines can be reduced as much. Power supply lines for backing up the battery become unnecessary by transferring, when power supply to the SDM is cut-off, data necessary for the backing up by multiplex communication to the BCM as hereinafter described. Since a signal is transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as described hereinabove, the necessity for individually laying wiring lines to the air bag alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is eliminated, and wiring lines are reduced. Also self diagnosis <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> is executed by multiplex communication, wiring lines for the same can be reduced similarly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> From the present table, a failure state can be detected based on a combination of state detection signals corresponding to load driving states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> Since the digital input interface is same as that described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>, description is given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>. When a switch <highlight><bold>1336</bold></highlight> is off, a voltage is clipped by a Zener diode <highlight><bold>1337</bold></highlight>, and an input signal <highlight><bold>1338</bold></highlight> exhibits a high level. When the switch <highlight><bold>1336</bold></highlight> is on, the input signal <highlight><bold>1338</bold></highlight> exhibits a low level. A capacitor C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference> is provided in order to remove noise. Those input signals are fetched by the CPU <highlight><bold>1314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference> illustrates a distribution situation of loads to an IPM <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> described above relating to the air conditioner control unit. Since the IPM is provided to control elements relating to the instrument panel, switches and alarm lamps around a driver are disposed for the IPM. A headerlamp switch <highlight><bold>1331</bold></highlight> and an ignition switch <highlight><bold>1333</bold></highlight> provide input signals relating to the air conditioner control unit. In order to light the illumination for the air conditioner panel when the headerlamps are turned on, the state of the headerlamp switch is transferred from the IPM to the air conditioner control unit via the BCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</cross-reference> shows a conventional example of a system construction of an air conditioner control unit and illustrates wiring line reduction effects by the present invention. Since an ignition switch signal is fetched by the BCM and transmitted by multiplex communication, wiring lines relating to the ignition switch <highlight><bold>1333</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Since the air conditioner control unit receives supply of power from the BCM and an over-current state of the air conditioner control unit is supervised by the BCM, fuses <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1342</bold></highlight> on the upstream can be reduced. Simultaneously, the necessity for laying power supply lines from the battery to the air conditioner control unit via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated, and wiring lines can be reduced as much. A power supply line <highlight><bold>1343</bold></highlight> for backing up the battery can be eliminated by transferring, when power supply to the air conditioner control unit is cut-off, data necessary for the backing up to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described. Since a coolant temperature sensor <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and a compressor clutch <highlight><bold>1344</bold></highlight> serve as input and output apparatus of the PCM, the air control unit is controllable by multiplex communication via the PCM, and reduction of wiring lines can be achieved. Since a signal is transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as described hereinabove, the necessity for laying wiring lines individually to the headerlamp switch <highlight><bold>1331</bold></highlight> is eliminated and wiring lines can be reduced. Also self diagnosis <highlight><bold>1353</bold></highlight> is executed by multiplex communication, wiring lines for the same can be reduced similarly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</cross-reference> illustrates a basic control flow of the air conditioner control unit of the present invention. After power supply is made available by the BCM, processing is started from a reset state <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. After the resetting, the processing advances to initialization processing <highlight><bold>1351</bold></highlight>, by which initialization of the entire system is performed. Then, the processing advances to air conditioner control processing <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight>, by which control of the doors and the motors is performed based on input information of various sensors. Thereafter, the processing advances to self diagnosprocesses <highlight><bold>1353</bold></highlight>, by which self diagnosis of the sensors and actuators in the system is performed. Then, the processing advances to transmit data writing processing <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight>, by which data to be transmitted from the air conditioner control unit to another control unit is written into the communication IC. In the present embodiment, since the air conditioner control unit serves as a backing up control unit when the BCM fails, it is discriminated by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1355</bold></highlight> whether or not an ACK (acknowledge signal) of the BCM has been sent back thereto. When no ACK signal of the BCM has been received, since it is discriminated that the BCM fails, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1356</bold></highlight>, by which BCM backing up processing is performed. In the BCM backing up processing of the processing <highlight><bold>1356</bold></highlight>, states of input apparatus connected to the BCM are fixed to predetermined values, and control of such control units as the FIM and the RIM which are controlled by the BCM is performed by the air conditioner control unit in substitution. It is to be noted that, in the present embodiment, since processing in substitution when the BCM fails is performed only by the air conditioner control unit, the apparatus which performs such processing is not limited to this, and naturally it is otherwise possible that some other control unit or units having a CPU perform such processing in substitution exclusively or cooperatively. By discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1357</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the ignition key switch is in an off state, and if the ignition key switch is in an off state, then the processing advances to ending processing <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight>, but if the ignition key switch is in an on state, the processing advances to the air conditioner control processing <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight>. By the ending processing <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight>, transfer processing of the backup data is performed. After the data transfer is completed, the processing advances to an end state <highlight><bold>1359</bold></highlight> to make preparations for cut-off of power supply by the BCM. </paragraph>

By discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1370</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the air conditioner is in an automatic mode. If the air conditioner is in the automatic mode, then the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1379</bold></highlight>, but if the air conditioner is in a manual mode, then the processing advances to the processing <highlight><bold>1371</bold></highlight>. By the processing <highlight><bold>1379</bold></highlight>, a desired preset temperature is read in. By processing <highlight><bold>13710</bold></highlight>, a current internal air temperature is read in. By discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13711</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not there is some temperature difference between the preset temperature and the current internal temperature. When some temperature difference is detected, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1371</bold></highlight>, by which temperature adjustment is performed. When no temperature difference is detected, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1375</bold></highlight>. By the processing <highlight><bold>1371</bold></highlight>, an opening of the air mix door is set in accordance with a logic determined in advance. Similarly, by processing <highlight><bold>1372</bold></highlight>, the position of the intake door is set; by processing <highlight><bold>1373</bold></highlight>, the position of the mode door is set; and by processing <highlight><bold>1374</bold></highlight>, the an amount of the blower motor is set. By the discrimination processing <highlight><bold>1375</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the air conditioner switch is in an off state, and if the air conditioner switch is in an off state, then the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>1376</bold></highlight>, by which a compressor off signal is set. By processing <highlight><bold>1377</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the air conditioner system has some error, and when the air conditioner system has some error, fail safe processing is performed by processing <highlight><bold>1378</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</cross-reference> illustrates details of the door opening setting processing mentioned hereinabove.

By processing <highlight><bold>1382</bold></highlight>, the door motor is driven based on the calculated opening. By processing <highlight><bold>1383</bold></highlight>, the driving signal of the door motor and the output state signal are monitored, and states of the load and the driving element in the output interface are supervised based on Table 3 given hereinabove. By power supply cut-off processing <highlight><bold>1384</bold></highlight>, failure diagnosis of the element and incidental cut-off processing are performed based on a result of the supervision described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</cross-reference> illustrates details of the blower fan wind amount setting processing described above. By processing <highlight><bold>1391</bold></highlight>, a blower wind amount is calculated based a logic determined in advance. By processing <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight>, the blower motor is driven based on the calculated wind amount. By processing <highlight><bold>1393</bold></highlight>, the driving signal of the blower motor and the output state signal are monitored, and states of the load and the driving element in the output interface are supervised based on Table 1 (same as that for the PCM control) given hereinabove. By power supply cut-off processing <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight>, failure diagnosis of the element and incidental interruption processing are performed based on a result of the supervision described above. The present processing is basically same as the load driving processing of the PCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</cross-reference> illustrates details of the power supply cut-off processing <highlight><bold>1384</bold></highlight> described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> If it is discriminated by load open discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13102</bold></highlight> or one driving element open failure (same as normal load cut-off state) discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13103</bold></highlight> that the load is open or one driving element is in an open state, since this is a condition wherein the load cannot be driven, an alarm is generated by processing <highlight><bold>131011</bold></highlight>. If it is discriminated by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13104</bold></highlight> that the load state is a battery short-circuit state, by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13105</bold></highlight> that the load state is a grounded state, by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13106</bold></highlight> that the load state is a short-circuited state, by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13107</bold></highlight> that two or more driving elements are in an open failure or by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13108</bold></highlight> that one driving element is in a short-circuited failure, since this is a state wherein a voltage continues to be normally applied to the driving element in the output stage, normal cut-off (off) of the load is selected by processing <highlight><bold>131012</bold></highlight>. When it is discriminated by two or more driving element short-circuit failure discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13109</bold></highlight> that two or more driving elements are in a short-circuit failure, since the load is in a normally energized state and load control from the air conditioner control unit side is impossible, an cut-off instruction is generated by processing <highlight><bold>131010</bold></highlight> to request for cut-off of power supply to the air conditioner control unit at the BCM on the upstream of the air conditioner control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference> illustrates details of the transmit data writing processing <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight> in the basic flow chart described above. By processing <highlight><bold>13111</bold></highlight>, in order to transmit data individually to the individual control units, a transmission mode of the transmission IC is designated to a physical address. When it is discriminated by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13112</bold></highlight> that the transmission destination is the PCM, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>13113</bold></highlight>. By the processing <highlight><bold>13113</bold></highlight>, the transmission destination address is set to the PCM and a compressor off signal is set, and they are written into the communication IC. When it is discriminated by discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13114</bold></highlight> that the transmission destination is the BCM, the processing advances to processing <highlight><bold>13115</bold></highlight>. By the processing <highlight><bold>13115</bold></highlight>, an operation confirmation signal for confirmation of backing up of the BCM described hereinabove is transmitted to the BCM.

<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</cross-reference> illustrates a multiplex communication data receive processing flow. Since the construction wherein external interrupt occurs with the CPU upon reception of data of the communication IC is adopted, the present processing is started by external interrupt in a state <highlight><bold>1190</bold></highlight>. By discrimination processing <highlight><bold>13121</bold></highlight>, it is discriminated whether or not the transmission destination is the BCM. If the transmission destination is the BCM, ignition key switch position information is read in by processing <highlight><bold>13122</bold></highlight>, and headerlamp switch position information is read in by processing <highlight><bold>13123</bold></highlight>, from the communication IC.

<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</cross-reference> is a system diagram showing a construction of an Antilock Brake System (hereinafter referred to as ABS) for a vehicle to which the power supply network of the present invention is applied. A control module <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> receives various sensor signals necessary for brake lock control upon braking and outputs driving signals for various actuators in accordance with a control method determined in advance. A right front wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight>, a left front wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>, a right rear wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>1403</bold></highlight> and a left rear wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> detect speeds of rotation of the individual wheels and output them as pulse signals to the ABS module <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. An ABS motor <highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight> intensifies the pressure of brake fluid accumulated upon ABS control. ABS solenoids <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight> control brake hydraulic pressure control valves for the right front wheel, left front wheel and rear wheels, respectively.

A multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>14010</bold></highlight> is part of the power supply network similarly and is provided in order to allow communication with a control unit such as the BCM <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 102</cross-reference> is a detailed diagrammatic view showing an internal construction of the ABS module <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> described above provide analog input signals, and the analog input signals are inputted to an analog input interface <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, by which they are converted so that they have a signal level (for example, 5 V of the full scale) with which they can be processed readily by a CPU (Central Processing Unit). The CPU <highlight><bold>1413</bold></highlight> converts the analog signals mentioned above into digital signals by means of A/D converters and fetches the digital signals into the inside of the CPU. Three different powers are supplied from the FIM including power to be supplied to the upstream side of each load, power to be supplied to a constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight> for a communication IC <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight> in the ABS and power to be supplied to another constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight> and an output interface <highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight> via a power supply cut-off switch <highlight><bold>1417</bold></highlight>. The constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight> is a constant voltage power supply generation circuit for exclusive use for the communication IC and is normally energized unless power supply from the FIM is cut off. The present circuit can be formed simply from a three-terminal regulator and so forth. The constant voltage power supply <highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight> supplies power to the CPU <highlight><bold>1413</bold></highlight> and the analog input interface <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>. The power supply cut-off switch <highlight><bold>1417</bold></highlight> is controlled directly by the communication IC and is provided to cut-off power supply when some trouble occurs with a grounded type load. The communication IC <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight> is connected to a multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>14010</bold></highlight> via a communication IC interface <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight>. Further, the communication IC <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight> is connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>1413</bold></highlight> so that it transmits and receives data necessary for the power supply network via the multiplex communication line <highlight><bold>14010</bold></highlight>. Detailed description of functions of the communication IC <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight> and the communication IC interface <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> is omitted here. The CPU <highlight><bold>1413</bold></highlight> includes a ROM (Read Only Memory) and a RAM (Random Access Memory) provided therein, and control software for the ABS and initial constants are stored in the ROM. </paragraph>

Since the ABS receives supply of power from the FIM and an over-current state of the ABS is supervised by the FIM, fuses <highlight><bold>1442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1443</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight> on the upstream can be reduced. Simultaneously, the necessity for laying supply lines from the battery to the ABS via the fuse box in the compartment is eliminated and wiring lines can be reduced as much. Wiring lines for backing up the battery can be eliminated by transmitting data necessary for backing up when power supply to the ABS is cut-off to the BCM by multiplex communication as hereinafter described. Since the driving element of the output interface can be used in substitution for an ABS motor relay <highlight><bold>1445</bold></highlight> and an ABS actuator relay <highlight><bold>1447</bold></highlight>, they can be abandoned. Since signals are transferred by multiplex communication via the IPM as hereinafter described, the necessity for laying wiring lines individually for the ABS alarm lamp <highlight><bold>1433</bold></highlight> and the stop lamp switch <highlight><bold>1432</bold></highlight> is eliminated, and wiring lines can be reduced. While a vehicle speed pulse signal <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> is outputted from the vehicle speed sensor mounted on the transmission, since, in the present invention, it is produced by the ABS control module and transmitted to another control unit by multiplex communication, relating wiring lines and sensors are unnecessary. Since also self diagnosis <highlight><bold>1441</bold></highlight> is executed by multiplex communication, wiring lines for the same can be reduced similarly. </paragraph>
