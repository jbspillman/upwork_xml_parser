<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical agent as well as food and/or beverage and cosmetics containing at least one polyphenol compound selected from strictinin and methylated derivatives thereof as an effective ingredient and, more particularly, it relates to a food having an action of suppressing the immediate-type and delayed-type allergy, to a pharmaceutical agent with an object of improving the allergy and to a cosmetic agent containing the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, an increase in allergic diseases has been noted and it is reported that, in about one-third of the newborn babies, onset of atopic dermatitis or asthma is observed. A drastic increase in onset of pollinosis has been becoming a big social problem as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has been believed that changes of environment surrounding us such as westernization of meals, air pollution, food additives and excessive stress are the causes of an increase in such allergic symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In view of the immunological competent cell and immunoglobulin which are participated therein, allergic reaction is classified into from type I to type IV. Diseases represented by allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma belong to the allergic reaction of type I where IgE antibody is produced in large quantities when exposed to allergen and chemical mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandin are produced and released from mast cells and basophils via the said IgE antibody whereby dilation of blood vessel, promotion of blood vessel permeability, shrinking of bronchial smooth muscles, stimulation of nerve terminals, etc. are induced. Therefore, for the therapy of allergic diseases of type I, antihistaminic agents and antiallergic agents having an action of suppressing the liberation of chemical mediators from mast cells have been used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, antihistaminic agents and basic antiallergic agents have adverse actions such as drowsiness, thirst, gastrointestinal troubles, etc. and their continuous administration for a long period causes a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Allergic reaction of type IV is a reaction of a delayed type in which T cells are participated where T cells receiving an antigen information via antigen-presenting cells such as Langerhans cells and macrophage produce and release various cytokines whereby an inflammation reaction of a delayed type takes place due to accumulation of eosinophils and macrophages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Allergic contact dermatitis is a typical disease which occurs due to an allergic reaction of type IV. Steroid agents are used for the therapy of allergic diseases of type IV and such steroid agents suppress the production of cytokine in T cells and show a dramatic effect for the therapy of eczema. On the other hand however, there is a possibility that they cause severe adverse actions such as a decrease in adrenocortical function, flushing of the skin, atrophy and dilation of capillaries by their administration for a long period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the meanwhile, tea is a typical luxurious beverage and has been drunk by many people during more than 2000 years. It has been also known that tea has various physiological functions and, for example, its antioxidative action, antitumor action, suppressive action to carcinogenesis, antibacterial action, antiviral action and anticarious action have been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With regard to an allergic action, there have been exemplified the therapeutic agent to the allergic reaction of type I as an antiallergic agent mainly comprising an extract from oolong tea using an action of suppressing the histamine liberation from mast cells as an indicator in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 258726/1991; the effective cases of natural caffeine for the promoting reaction of blood vessel permeability in allergic symptom of type I in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 17865/1995; and therapeutic agents such as antiallergic agent, anti-inflammatory agent, anti-atopic dermatitis agent and anti-psoriasis where an extract of oolong tea is an effective ingredient in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 77231/1998 and 175874/1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It has been further reported that green tea catechins such as epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate suppress the liberation of histamine from mast cells in abdominal cavity of rat (Journal of Japanese Society for Food Science and Technology, Vol. 42, No. 11, p. 952-958, 1955; and <highlight><italic>Allergy</italic></highlight>, Vol. 52, No. 1, pp. 58-64, 1997). However, there has been no report that polyphenols such as strictinin suppress the production of IgE by B cells which is an origin of allergic reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical agents for allergic diseases have been developed and used for the therapy already but, since they have adverse actions, there has been a strong demand for antiallergic agents derived from natural products where a long-term administration is possible, safety is high and no adverse reaction takes place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, an object of the invention is to provide a therapeutic and preventive agent for allergic diseases which has no adverse action, shows a high safety even by a long-term administration and is able to be utilized for food and/or beverage and cosmetic agent which are used daily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors have carried out a screening of substances having antiallergic action using a suppressive action for the production of IgE as an indication and have found that polyphenols such as strictinin exhibits such an effect and, based upon such a finding, the invention has been achieved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Extraction of Polyphenol Fraction from Various Tea Leaves (Tea Leaf Extract). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Tea leaves (100 g) dried with microwave were extracted with 50% methanol and the extracted fraction was extracted with 30% chloroform. Its aqueous phase was further extracted with ethyl acetate and the ethyl acetate layer after the extraction was fractionated using an ODS column. An example of the method for the purification of strictinin is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The fractionated fractions were named Fr. 1 to 5, respectively. All of Fr. 1 to 5 were once freeze-dried and then Fr. 1 to 2, Fr. 3 to 4 and Fr. 5 were dissolved in water, 0.2% DMSO and 0.1% DMSO, respectively so that each fraction was made 1 mg/mL. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Identification of Active Fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each of Fr. 1 to 5 in Experimental Example 1 was evaluated for its antiallergic action in vitro by a method for the expression of a transcript of an IgE heavy chain germline transcript which was to investigate the suppression of IgE production in human B cells (IgE class switch suppression). This is a method utilizing the fact that, when human B cells are stimulated by IL-4 to induce the production of IgE, a transcription is started from the upstream intron corresponding to an &egr; region (C&egr;) in the constant domain gene of the Ig gene whereupon a transcript (C&egr;GT: germline transcript) is expressed and, after that, a class switch of IgE is resulted by a DNA recombination. C&egr;GT is an RNA which is always expressed before the IgE production is induced and the expressed amount of C&egr;GT is proportional to the class switch amount of the IgE gene. Therefore, when the degree of expressed amount of C&egr;GT is detected, it is possible to estimate the IgE class switch amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A method for the expression of an IgE heavy chain germline transcript was carried out according to the following procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Human B cell line DND 39 (available from Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratory) was prepared into 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells/mL and stimulated by adding IL-4 thereto to make the final concentration 25 U/mL. At that time, each of Fr. 1 to 5 prepared in Experimental Example 1 in a concentration of 10 &mgr;g/mL was added together with IL-4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the meanwhile, IL-4 (final concentration: 25 U/mL) and 2 ng/mL of a transforming growth factor &bgr; (TGF-beta; manufactured by Peprotech) were added to the above human cell line and the mixture was used as a positive control for suppressing the expression of C&egr;GT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> They were incubated for 48 hours and centrifuged (300&times;g, 37&deg; C.) to collect the cells and the total RNA was extracted with 1 mL of a reagent for collection and extraction of RNA (trade name: Trizol; manufactured by Gibco BRL). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Then, a cDNA library was prepared according to the following procedure. First, concentration of the extracted total RNA was measured by an absorptiometer, a portion of 10 &mgr;g was taken in a 0.6 mL tube and water was added thereto to make 11.8 &mgr;L. To this were added each 1.0 L of a 0.5 &mgr;g/&mgr;L oligo dT primer and a 20 &mgr;M C&egr;GT antisense primer. The tube was incubated at 70&deg; C. for 10 minutes and quickly cooled in ice for 10 minutes and annealed to anneal mRNA, oligo dT primer and C&egr;GT antisense primer. This was mixed with 2.0 &mgr;L of an RNase-free 10 mM dNTP (manufactured by Amersham), 4.0 &mgr;L of 5&times;buffer attached to an MMLV-reverse transcriptase (manufactured by Amersham), 0.1 &mgr;L of an RNase inhibitor (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and 0.1 &mgr;L (final concentration: 20-200 units/tube) of an MMLV-reverse transcriptase. The mixture was incubated at 37&deg; C. for 1 hour to synthesize cDNA. The synthesized cDNA was amplified by a PCR. Sense and antisense primers were prepared based upon a base sequence of human GAPDH and C&egr;GT registered at the Gene Bank. The structures are shown in the Sequence Listing. Thus, a C&egr;GT sense primer, a C&egr;GT antisense primer, a human GAPDH sense primer and a human GAPDH antisense primer are shown in SEQ ID NO:1, NO:2, NO:3 and NO:4, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> C&egr;GT-DNA was amplified using the said primer by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. As a template for the PCR, 1 &mgr;L of an original solution of cDNA was used and, for the detection of C&egr;GT, 0.8 &mgr;L of 10 mM dNTP, 0.5 &mgr;L of sense primer, 0.5 &mgr;L of antisense primer, 0.1 &mgr;L of AmpliTaq Gold (manufactured by Perkin Elmer) and 1 &mgr;L of 10&times;buffer attached to the AmpliTaq Gold were mixed and distilled water was added thereto to make the total volume 10 &mgr;L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For the detection of GAPDH, 0.8 &mgr;L of 10 mM dNTP, 1 &mgr;L of MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.5 &mgr;L of sense primer, 0.5 &mgr;L of antisense primer, 0.1 &mgr;L of Taq polymerase (manufactured by Fermentas) and 1 &mgr;L of 10&times;Taq buffer attached to the Taq polymerase were mixed and distilled water was added thereto to make the total volume 10 &mgr;L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A PCR was carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (manufactured by Perkin Elmer) and the condition therefor was as follows. Thus, for the detection of C&egr;GT, a cycle of 95&deg; C. for 30 seconds, 60&deg; C. for 30 seconds and 72&deg; C. for 30 seconds was conducted for 15 cycles and, finally, a reaction was carried out at 72&deg; C. for 7 minutes. For the detection of GAPDH, a cycle of 95&deg; C. for 30 seconds, 60&deg; C. for 30 seconds and 72&deg; C. for 30 seconds was conducted for 10 cycles and, finally, a reaction was carried out at 72&deg; C. for 7 minutes. After that, the resulting PCR product was subjected to an electrophoresis using an agarose gel for separation (concentration: 1%; manufactured by Sawadi Technology). After completion of the electrophoresis, it was transcribed to a plus-charged Nylon membrane (manufactured by Amersham) (a southern transfer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After that, a hybridization was carried out on the Nylon membrane to which the migrated pattern was transcribed using an oligo DNA fluorolabeled with C&egr;GT-DNA which was amplified for 15 times in the above-mentioned PCR &lsqb;which was prepared in such a manner that an oligonucleotide (SEQ ID NO:5 of the Sequence Listing) was picked out from a region pinched by the above-mentioned sense and antisense primers used for the PCR based on a base sequence of human C&egr;GT and then the oligonucleotide is applied to an oligo labeling kit (manufactured by Amersham)&rsqb; as a probe. After the hybridization, a reaction with CDP-Star (Amersham) which was a fluorescence detecting agent was carried out and the expressed amount of C&egr;GT was measured from the resulting fluorescence intensity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an influence of each fraction on C&egr;GT inducible expression by IL-4 in the human B cell line DND 39. In the drawing, GAPDH means glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase and &square; shows a control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the expressed amount of C&egr;GT was suppressed in the fraction of Fr. 3 as compared with other fractions. From that fact, it was found that an active component was available in the fraction of Fr. 3 and, after that, the fraction was finely fractionated using an ODS column whereupon one of the fractions was found to be a fraction containing strictinin only. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Measurement of Antiallergic Activity in Human B Cell line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Strictinin which was identified as an active component in Experimental Example 2 was used for measuring the antiallergic activity in human B cell line according to the same way as in the method for the expression of an IgE heavy chain germline transcript mentioned in Experimental Example2. Incidentally, strictinin was added at the same time with IL-4. The adding concentrations of strictinin were 1, 10 and 25 &mgr;M. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an influence of strictinin on the C&egr;GT inducible expression by IL-4 in the human cell line DND 39. In the drawing, GAPDH shows glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase and &square; shows a control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it was apparent that, in the human B cell line, strictinin strongly suppressed the IgE class switch by addition of IL-4. Since IgE is an immunoglobulin deeply participating in the allergic reaction, the fact that IgE class switch is suppressed means that antiallergic activity is available. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Human peripheral blood normal cells (monocytes; separated from the blood which was collected from a healthy human volunteer) was used instead of the human B cell line DND 39 of Experimental Example 3 and an antiallergic activity was measured by the same way as in the method for the expression of an IgE heavy chain germline transcript mentioned in Experimental Example 2. Like in Experimental Example 2, strictinin was added at the same time with IL-4. Incidentally, the adding concentration of strictinin was made 25 &mgr;M. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an influence of strictinin on the C&egr;GT inducible expression by IL-4 in the human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
