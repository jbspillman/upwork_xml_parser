<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to improvements in rebound property of a baseball or softball bat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Baseball or softball bats (hereinafter, referred to as a &ldquo;bat&rdquo;) made of various materials are commercially available. Some are made of wood or metal such as titanium, titanium alloy, aluminum alloy or the like. Others are made of fiber-reinforced plastic in which a matrix resin is impregnated and cured in carbon fiber, glass fiber or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When a bat is structured with only one of those materials, however, it is difficult to change a property value of the bat to a large extent. Therefore, a bat made from a combination of various materials has been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve a significant change in a value of rebound property of the bat, a variety of bats coated with an elastic body have been developed. For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 62-106784 discloses a cushion bat with a shape identical to a conventional one, of which core portion extending to entire length thereof is coated with an elastic body. Japanese Utility Model Laying-Open No. 63-156667 discloses a bat packed with a rubber sponge, having two rubber sponges bonded to a wooden core. In addition, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-153013 discloses a baseball bat, in which a circumferential surface of a core member made of light metal pipe is coated with an elastic body except for a grip portion. Further, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 7-275413 discloses a ball-game bat, in which a core member made of carbon fiber is coated with a hard urethane layer, and a protection layer composed of glass fiber having a synthetic resin impregnated is provided thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the bats disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 62-106784, Japanese Utility Model Laying-Open No. 63-156667 and Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-153013, an object of coating with an elastic body is to obtain a bat capable of lowering the impact and vibration in ball-hitting, and suppressing a hit distance of the ball for safe use. Accordingly, the elastic body is used, having a physical property that will suppress the hit distance. These bats are suited, for example, for a use in a narrow space, hitting table tennis ball, or toss batting. Moreover, an object of Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 7-275413 is to reduce manufacturing cost as well as to improve manufacturing process and a method of adjusting weight and &ldquo;crack&rdquo; in hitting the ball. Therefore, appearance and rebound property are not changed at all, compared with a conventional bat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a baseball or softball bat is required to have durability and a property to carry the ball far. The conventional bat as described above is not satisfactory for such requirements. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a bat having good durability and capable of carrying a ball farther, a bat base member forming such a bat as well as an elastic sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Inventor has made various attempts and finally implemented a bat structure capable of carrying the ball far. The inventor has found that a high rebound property value of the bat is effective for increasing hit distance of the ball, and that, for improving the rebound property value, it is effective to reduce deformation of the ball in hitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce deformation of the ball when it is hit, it is possible, for example, to coat the surface of the bat with an elastic body. For a bat used in a baseball or softball game, however, not only durability and rebound property but also mass and balance are important. If the bat is entirely coated with the elastic body, the mass of the bat will be larger, and it becomes difficult to achieve a design with these properties being well-balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described findings of the inventors, a baseball or softball bat according to one aspect of the present invention includes a tip portion, a ball-hitting portion, a tapered portion and a grip portion. The ball-hitting portion has a depression integrally coated with an elastic body that has a physical property to attain a high rebound property value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, when hitting the ball, the elastic body will be compressed and deform, and energy loss due to the ball deformation can be suppressed. Further, the ball will be carried farther with a restoring force of the elastic body. Consequently, the bat can be obtained, that has a rebound property superior to a conventional one and capable of carrying the ball farther. In other words, presence of the elastic body can reduce the extent of deformation of the ball when it is hit, and the restoring force of the elastic body is additionally made use of. Thus, the bat can carry the ball farther. In particular, even when hitting a soft ball such as a rubber baseball or a rubber softball, rebound property of the bat can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, since only a portion of the bat, that is, the depression of the ball-hitting portion, is coated with the elastic body, an increase of the mass of the bat can be suppressed, than when it is entirely coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In games, a batter releases the bat when he starts running after hitting the ball. If the bat is coated with the elastic body up to the tip portion, the tip portion may soon be damaged by friction with the ground. Meanwhile, the bat according to the present invention can avoid such damage because the elastic body coats only the ball-hitting portion. (When the batter releases the bat after hitting, possibility of breaking the elastic body due to contact with the ground can be lowered.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The bat according to the present invention can have the tip portion, the ball-hitting portion with the depression, the tapered portion and the grip portion formed with a hard material similar to the conventional bat. Therefore, the bat can have rigidity comparable to the conventional one, and thus the bat is durable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the bat according to the present invention, as vibration in ball-hitting is absorbed by the elastic body, batter&apos;s hands will not be benumbed. Moreover, a time period during which the ball is in contact with the ball-hitting portion is extended because the elastic body deforms when hitting. Therefore, a feel that the ball is being on the bat can be obtained, and hitting feel will be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, in order to avoid fractures at a corner in the bottom portion of the depression due to stress concentration and at a corner in the upper portion thereof due to the impact of the ball, desirably, the depression is formed in the following manner. Namely, it is formed with a ball-hitting center portion having an outer diameter smaller than that of the ball-hitting portion. An outer diameter thereof from an end of a tip portion side of the ball-hitting center portion to the boundary of the tip portion and an outer diameter from an end of a tapered portion side of the ball-hitting center portion to the boundary of the tapered portion are gradually increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, the depression of the ball-hitting portion may include a center portion bottom wall, distance of which from the central axis of the bat is smaller than that from the central axis to an outermost circumferential portion of the ball-hitting portion; a stepped portion bottom wall, distance of which from the central axis of the bat is larger than that from the central axis to the center portion bottom wall and is smaller than that from the central axis to the outermost circumferential portion of the ball-hitting portion, and positioned at both ends of the center portion bottom wall in a direction along the central axis, and extending in a direction substantially the same as the central axis; and a sidewall connecting the center portion bottom wall with the stepped portion bottom wall. The sidewall may be inclined relative to the central axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the stepped portion bottom wall is formed in an end portion of the depression, it appears that a convex portion is formed on the sidewall thereof. Accordingly, contact area of the wall surface of the depression with the elastic body can be made larger. Thus, when hitting the ball at the above-described end portion of the elastic body, separation will be unlikely, and a bat with good durability can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, the ball-hitting portion may include an outermost circumferential portion positioned in a region outside the depression and having a largest outer diameter; a small outer diameter portion provided as a wall surface of the depression and having an outer diameter smaller than that of the outermost circumferential portion; and a medium outer diameter portion provided as a wall surface of the depression, extending in a direction substantially the same with the central axis of the baseball or softball bat, positioned at an end portion of the depression and having an outer diameter larger than that of the small outer diameter portion and smaller than that of the outermost circumferential portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, preferably, the elastic body is of a synthetic resin foam having JIS C hardness of 20 to 80, specific gravity of 0.25 to 0.70 and tensile stress (tensile strength) of 1.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa in 300% elongation. More preferably, the elastic body has JIS C hardness of 20 to 50, specific gravity of 0.25 to 0.50 and tensile stress of 1.0 MPa to 1.8 MPa in 300% elongation. In this case, using what is called a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; synthetic resin foam as described above will effectively improve a rebound property value of the bat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the baseball or softball bat according one aspect as described above, the synthetic resin foam preferably uses a polyurethane foam, in view of manufacturing cost and formability. In other words, if what is called the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; polyurethane foam is used as the elastic body, the hit distance of the ball can effectively be improved, and an increase of the manufacturing cost of the bat can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In general, polyurethane can be categorized into three types: soft, semi-hard and hard. A soft polyurethane foam used as the elastic body in the present invention includes what is classified as soft and semi-hard, not including hard. Here, hard polyurethane is generally elongated a few percent to several tens of percent. Hard polyurethane with such elongation capability is not suitable for the polyurethane foam as the elastic body in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above may be provided with a protection film formed on an outermost layer of the elastic body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In such a case, as the protection film can suppress abrasion of the elastic body, durability of the bat can be improved. In particular when a soft synthetic resin foam as described above is used as the elastic body, durability of the bat can effectively be improved by forming the protection film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, the protection film may include at least one of a synthetic resin sheet and a synthetic resin tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, preferably, the protection film has a thickness of not smaller than 0.1 mm and not larger than 1.0 mm, and includes a thermoplastic polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this case, workability in forming the protection film and adhesiveness of the elastic body with the same can be effectively improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to enhance durability of the bat, desirably, a synthetic resin sheet or tube having sufficient abrasion-resistance coats, and is formed on, the outermost layer of the above synthetic resin foam. In addition, considering workability and adhesiveness, desirably, the synthetic resin sheet or tube is a thermoplastic polyurethane sheet or tube having a thickness of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this case, durability of the bat can be improved without impairing the property of the elastic body encapsulated inside the depression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above thermoplastic polyurethane sheet or tube is desirably transparent or translucent. The above sheet is printed on one surface, and is fused and adhered in a tube-like shape to the surface of the elastic body with the printed surface facing inward. Thus, the print can be clearly viewed through the sheet, to enhance the appearance of the bat. Even after a prolonged use of the bat, the print will not separate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the baseball or softball bat according to one aspect as described above, preferably, the depression is formed on the entire circumference of the ball-hitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In such a case, no matter which portion of the entire circumference of the ball-hitting portion a batter may hit the ball, hit distance of the same can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A bat base member according to another aspect of the present invention constitutes a baseball or softball bat including a tip portion, a ball-hitting portion, a tapered portion and a grip portion. In a region to be the ball-hitting portion, a depression is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Using such a bat base member, the bat according to the present invention can be readily manufactured by integrally coating the depression with the elastic body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the bat base member according to another aspect as described above, the region to be the ball-hitting portion may include an outermost circumferential portion positioned in a region outside the depression and having a largest outer diameter; a small outer diameter portion provided as a wall surface of the depression and having an outer diameter smaller than that of the outermost circumferential portion; and a medium outer diameter portion provided as a wall surface of the depression, extending in a direction substantially the same with the central axis of the bat, positioned at an end portion of the depression and having an outer diameter larger than that of the small outer diameter portion and smaller than that of the outermost circumferential portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this case, a region with a small thickness can be formed in an end portion of the elastic body coating the depression. Therefore, a bat can be readily formed, in which the elastic body is unlikely to separate from the bat base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An elastic sleeve according to another aspect of the present invention constitutes a baseball or softball bat including a tip portion, a ball-hitting portion, a tapered portion and a grip portion, and is fit into a depression formed in the ball-hitting portion. The elastic sleeve includes a smallest inner diameter portion positioned in a center portion therein and having a smallest inner diameter; and an enlarged inner diameter portion positioned at an end portion thereof, having an inner diameter larger than that of the smallest inner diameter portion and extending in a direction substantially the same with the elastic sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Using such an elastic sleeve, a bat according to the present invention can readily be manufactured by integrally coating the depression of the ball-hitting portion with the elastic sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

At an end portion of grip portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a grip end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fit in and secured to a bat base member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In such a bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, when hitting the ball, elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be compressed and deform, and energy loss due to the ball deformation can be suppressed. Further, the ball will be carried additionally with a restoring force of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Consequently, bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be obtained, having a rebound property superior to a conventional one and capable of carrying the ball farther. In particular, even when hitting a soft ball such as a rubber baseball or a rubber softball, rebound property of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition, since only a portion of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is coated with elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an increase of the mass of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be suppressed, compared with when bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is entirely coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In games, a batter releases bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when he starts running after hitting the ball. If bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coated with the elastic body as far as tip portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the elastic body and the like may soon be damaged by friction of tip portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the ground. Bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can avoid such damage because elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> coats only ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can have tip portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, tapered portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and grip portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed with a hard material similar to the conventional one, as described below. Therefore, bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can have rigidity comparable to the conventional one, and thus bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is durable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition, in bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, as vibration in ball-hitting is absorbed by elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, batter&apos;s hands will not be benumbed. Moreover, a time period during which the ball is in contact with ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is extended because elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> deforms when hitting. Therefore, a feel that the ball is being on bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be obtained, and hitting feel will be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Moreover, depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire circumference of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, with no matter which portion of the entire circumference of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a batter may hit the ball, hit distance of the same can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> corner <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a bottom portion and a corner <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in an upper portion of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be rounded, and a sidewall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be formed perpendicularly to a central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in a direction of bat length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The whole bat, having depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed in ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (bat base member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), may be formed with any of the conventional materials, such as wood, metal or fiber-reinforced plastic. Tip portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and grip end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with bat base member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a whole bat, or may be formed separately for attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Desirably, elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> integrally coats depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, using injection molding or cast molding of a synthetic resin. Alternatively, elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as an elastic sleeve may be formed separately so as to fit with a shape of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for adhering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be of a material having a low ratio of energy loss when restituting after elastic deformation, and a material such as ionomer, butadiene-based rubber and the like as well as an air bag can be used. Considering mass, ratio of energy loss, manufacturing cost and formability, a polyurethane foam having JIS C hardness of 20 to 80, specific gravity of 0.25 to 0.70 and tensile stress of 1.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa in 300% elongation is preferred. The range of those figures was determined for a reason as described below. When hardness is set to 20 or lower, it becomes difficult to form a bat. When it is set to 80 or higher, rebound property will not be improved, compared with a conventional bat. Similarly, when specific gravity is set to 0.25 or lower, it becomes difficult to form a bat, and when it is set to 0.70 or higher, rebound property will not be improved, compared with the conventional bat. In addition, when tensile stress in 300% elongation is set to 1.0 MPa or lower, it becomes difficult to form a bat, and when it is set to 4.0 MPa or higher, rebound property will not be improved, compared with the conventional bat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> If priority is given to rebound property, for elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a polyurethane foam having JIS C hardness of 20 to 50, specific gravity of 0.25 to 0.50 and tensile stress of 1.0 MPa to 1.8 MPa in 300% elongation is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> second variation of the bat will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> basically has a similar structure to bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. On the surface of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, however, a sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a protection film is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thus, as sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provides protection of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, durability of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be improved. In particular, when a synthetic resin foam is used for elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, durability of the bat can effectively be improved by arranging such a sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> For sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed and used for integral coating of an outermost layer of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> composed of the synthetic resin foam and the like, desirably, a synthetic resin sheet or tube having a good abrasion-resistance is used. Considering workability and adhesiveness, desirably, the synthetic resin sheet or tube is a thermoplastic polyurethane sheet or tube having a thickness of not smaller than 0.1 mm and not larger than 1.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Here, if the thickness of the synthetic resin sheet or tube is less than 0.1 mm, strength of the sheet or tube itself is not sufficient, and does not enhance durability. On the other hand, if the thickness exceeds 1.0 mm, sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> itself becomes hard, and may impair property of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> encapsulated inside. Desirably, the thermoplastic polyurethane sheet or tube having a JIS A hardness of 80 to 100 and tensile strength of 450 to 500 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is used. If JIS A hardness is less than 80, strength of the sheet or tube itself is not sufficient, and does not enhance durability. On the other hand, if JIS A hardness exceeds <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> itself becomes hard, and may impair the property of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> encapsulated inside. The same will also apply to tensile strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the synthetic resin sheet used for sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is desirably transparent or translucent. Sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is printed on one surface, and is fused and adhered in a tube-like shape, with the printed surface facing inward. Then the tube is formed integrally with elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the print can be clearly viewed through the sheet, to enhance the appearance of the bat. Even after a prolonged use of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the print will not separate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a second embodiment of a bat according to the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> basically has the same structure as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> except for the shape of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In other words, depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include a center portion bottom wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as a small outer diameter portion of ball hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>distance of which from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of baseball or softball bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is smaller than distance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to an outermost circumferential portion of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; an end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a stepped portion bottom wall (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), distance of which from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is larger than distance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to center portion bottom wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is smaller than distance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to outermost circumferential portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and positioned at both ends of ball-hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a direction along central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and extending in a direction substantially the same as central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; and a sidewall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connecting ball-hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a medium outer diameter portion. Sidewall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is inclined relative to central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this case, in an enlarged inner diameter portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), which is an end portion of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) as an elastic sleeve positioned on end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a thickness relatively smaller than in a smallest inner diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), which is a center portion of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. (Elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes smallest inner diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as well as enlarged inner diameter portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> positioned at an end portion of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, having an inner diameter larger than that of smallest inner diameter portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and extending in a direction substantially the same as elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (a direction in which central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition, when end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in an end portion of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it appears that a convex portion (a stepped portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is formed on the side surface thereof. Accordingly, contact area of the side surface of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be made larger. Thus, when hitting the ball at the end portion of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, separation of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be unlikely, and bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with good durability can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may specifically be shaped in a following manner. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, assume that distance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the outermost circumference of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is set to 34.5 mm and distance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to ball-hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set to 20 mm. In this example, distance T, which is a depth from the outermost circumferential surface of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to the surface of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, can be set to not smaller than 1.0 mm and not larger than 10.0 mm. Preferably, distance T is set to not smaller than 1.5 mm and not larger than 7.0 mm. More preferably, distance T is set to not smaller than 2.0 mm and not larger than 4.0 mm. If distance T is less than 1.0 mm, the thickness of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) arranged on end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be too small. This may cause elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to separate or to break easily. On the other hand, if distance T is over 10.0 mm, the body strength of bat base member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is a body of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), may not be sufficient (sufficient strength cannot be achieved). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Width L of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be set to not smaller than 3.0 mm and not larger than 30.0 mm. In addition, preferably, width L is set to not smaller than 5.0 mm and not larger than 25.0 mm. More preferably, width L is set to not smaller than 10.0 mm and not larger than 20.0 mm. If width L is less than 3.0 mm, contact area of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) with end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be too small, resulting in easy separation of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If width L is over 30.0 mm, the size of a portion where elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a sufficient thickness is arranged will be smaller in ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). That is, the portion capable of maximizing the hit distance of the ball will be made smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The inclination angle of the surface of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> relative to central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) can be set to not smaller than &minus;18&deg; and not larger than &plus;18&deg;. Here, inclination angle of &minus;18&deg; means that when a tip portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) side of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inclined toward central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side, a phantom straight line along the surface of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> cross with an angle of 18&deg;. Similarly, inclination angle of &plus;18&deg; means that when a grip portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) side of bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inclined toward central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side, a phantom straight line along the surface of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> cross with an angle of 18&deg;. In addition, preferably, the inclination angle is set to not smaller than &minus;12&deg; and not larger than &plus;12&deg;. More preferably, the inclination angle is set to not smaller than &minus;6&deg; and not larger than &plus;6&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If the inclination angle of end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is less than &minus;18&deg; or over &plus;18&deg;, elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> tends to separate from bat base member <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, sidewall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connecting end portion region <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with center portion bottom wall <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting center portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(a center portion of depression <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) may be inclined relative to central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or may extend substantially perpendicularly to central axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> variation of the second embodiment of the bat according to the present invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, though bat <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> basically has the same structure as the one shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is not formed on the surface of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of ball-hitting portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. That is, the surface of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is exposed. In this case as well, the same effect as with the bat shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the following, results from two experiments conducted to verify the effect of a polyurethane foam used for a material of elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> First, using an experiment apparatus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> rebound experiment of a ball-hitting portion model was conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the experiment apparatus included a pitching machine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a high-speed video camera <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and an image analyzer (not shown). Two types of ball-hitting portion models <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a hit target of a ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> were provided. One was of an iron plate only, and the other was prepared by bonding an elastic body to an iron plate. In the experiment, ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> was fed from pitching machine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to impact fixed ball-hitting portion model <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. High-speed video camera <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> filmed the impact from right beside. Then, restitution coefficient was calculated from the speed of ball <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> before and after the impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The elastic body used for the ball-hitting portion model was a polyurethane foam sheet having JIS C hardness of 40 to 80 and specific gravity of 0.35 to 0.66, and was prepared by bonding two square sheets with a side of 10 cm long and a thickness of 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The present experiment was conducted using a rubber baseball, the reason for which is as follows. When hitting a rubber baseball or softball, elastic deformation of the ball is too large and rebound property of the bat cannot fully be taken advantage of. Accordingly, significant difference in rebound property cannot be observed, no matter which bat may be used. Therefore, in order to verify the effect of a structure of the ball-hitting portion capable of improving rebound property of the bat even for such a soft ball, a rubber baseball was used. Thus, though degrees may vary, similar effect can be obtained in both leather baseball and leather softball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, an equation of calculating restitution coefficient e and description of the reference characters are provided in Equation 1. The method of measuring data is also shown below.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> V&bull;BALL (OUT): velocity of gravity center of the ball after impact (m/s) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> V&bull;BALL (IN): velocity of gravity center of the ball before impact (m/s) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The velocity of gravity center of the ball in the above equation was obtained by analyzing with an image analyzer, an image filmed by the high-speed video camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, a result of a rebound experiment, in which a rubber baseball impacts each ball-hitting portion model with a speed of 30 m/s, is shown in Table 1 below.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the result in Table 5, the bat of the present invention has a restitution coefficient approximately 7% higher. Therefore, the bat of the present invention can carry the ball farther than the conventional one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Thus, the bat according to the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> has a restitution coefficient higher than the conventional one, probably because of the following reasons. In the conventional bat, when hitting the ball, a ball-hitting surface will flexure and the ball considerably deforms. Then, the ball is carried while the ball-hitting surface and the ball restitute. On the other hand, in a bat according to the present invention, the thermoplastic polyurethane tube with a thickness of 0.3 mm and the elastic body (or elastic body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are initially compressed, and the impact energy in ball-hitting is converted to compression energy. As the ball is compressed and deforms thereafter, the extent of deformation of the ball in hitting will be smaller. As a result, energy loss due to ball deformation is lowered, and restoring force of the elastic body is added. Thus, rebound property is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In addition, it goes without saying that the thermoplastic polyurethane tube integrally formed on the outermost layer of the elastic body functions without impairing the property of the elastic body encapsulated inside, and has good durability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The result of the above actual hitting test is the average of five amateur baseball dub members. As were predicted through the results of the rebound experiment, the bat according to the present invention could carry the ball farther than the conventional one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the present invention, the elastic body will be compressed and deform in hitting the ball, and energy loss due to the ball deformation will be suppressed. Further, the ball will be carried additionally with a restoring force of the elastic body. Consequently, the bat can be obtained, having rebound property superior to a conventional one and capable of carrying the ball farther. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In particular, even when hitting a soft ball such as a rubber baseball or a rubber softball, rebound property of the bat can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the outermost layer of the elastic body is coated with a thermoplastic polyurethane sheet or tube of a thickness of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm having a good abrasion-resistance. Thus, durability of the bat can be improved without impairing the property of the elastic body encapsulated inside. In addition, stepped portions (end portion regions) are provided in both the vicinities of a tip portion and a tapered portion. Thus, the elastic body and the thermoplastic polyurethane sheet will not separate even in the end portion, exhibiting good durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The above thermoplastic polyurethane sheet is desirably transparent or translucent. The sheet is printed on one surface, and is fused and adhered in a tube-like shape, with the printed surface facing inward. Thus, the print can be clearly viewed through the sheet, to enhance the appearance. Even after a prolonged use of bat, the print will not separate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In games, a batter releases the bat when he starts running after hitting the ball. If the bat is coated with the elastic body up to the tip portion, the tip portion may soon be damaged by friction with the ground. Meanwhile, the bat according to the present invention can avoid such damage because the elastic body coats only the ball-hitting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The bat according to the present invention can have the tip portion, the ball-hitting portion with the depression, the tapered portion and the grip portion formed with a hard material similar to the conventional one. Therefore, the bat can have rigidity comparable to the conventional one, and thus the bat is durable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In addition, in a bat according to the present invention, as vibration in ball-hitting is absorbed by the elastic body, batter&apos;s hands will not be benumbed. Moreover, a time period during which the ball is in contact with the ball-hitting portion is extended because the elastic body deforms when hitting. Therefore, a feel that the ball is being on the bat can be obtained, and hitting feel will be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
