<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for creating lesions and assessing their completeness or transmurality. Assessment of transmurality of a lesion is accomplished by monitoring the impedance of the tissue to be ablated.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to tissue ablation devices generally and relates more particularly to devices adapted to ablate lines of tissue, for example for use in conjunction with an electrosurgical version of the Maze procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The Maze procedure is a surgical intervention for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) that is resistant to other medical treatments. The operation employs incisions in the right and left atria which divide the atria into electrically isolated portions which in turn results in an orderly passage of the depolarization wave front from the sino-atrial node (SA Node) to the atrial-ventricular node (AV Node) while preventing reentrant wave front propagation. Although successful in treating AF, the surgical Maze procedure is quite complex and is currently performed by a limited number of highly skilled cardiac surgeons in conjunction with other open-heart procedures. As a result of the complexities of the surgical procedure, there has been an increased level of interest in procedures employing electrosurgical devices or other types of ablation devices, e.g. thermal ablation, micro-wave ablation, cryo-ablation or the like to ablate tissue along pathways approximating the incisions of the Maze procedure. . Electrosurgical systems for performing such procedures are described in U.S. Pat. No 5,916,213, issued to Hiassaguerre, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,961, issued to Maguire, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,661, all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Cryo-ablation systems for performing such procedures are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,280 issued to Avitall, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with the use of electrosurgical ablation devices, various control mechanisms have been developed to control delivery of ablation energy to achieve the desired result of ablation, i.e. killing of cells at the ablation site while leaving the basic structure of the organ to be ablated intact. Such control systems include measurement of temperature and impedance at or adjacent to the ablation site, as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,681, issued to Struhl, et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there has been substantial work done toward assuring that the ablation procedure is complete, i.e. that the ablation extends through the thickness of the tissue to be ablated, before terminating application of ablation energy. This desired result is some times referred to as a &ldquo;transmural&rdquo; ablation. For example, detection of a desired drop in electrical impedance at the electrode site as an indicator of transmurality is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,721 issued to Marchlinski et al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, detection of an impedance rise or an impedance rise following an impedance fall are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,671 issued to Yates and U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,684 issued to Hassler, respectively, also incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Three basic approaches have been employed to create elongated lesions using electrosurgical devices. The first approach is simply to create a series of short lesions using a contact electrode, moving it along the surface of the organ wall to be ablated to create a linear lesion. This can be accomplished either by making a series of lesions, moving the electrode between lesions or by dragging the electrode along the surface of the organ to be ablated and continuously applying ablation energy, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,533 issued to Mulier, et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The second basic approach to creation of elongated lesions is simply to employ an elongated electrode, and to place the elongated electrode along the desired line of lesion along the tissue. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,213, cited above and. The third basic approach to creation of elongated lesions is to provide a series of electrodes and arrange the series of electrodes along the desired line of lesion. The electrodes may be activated individually or in sequence, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,961, also cited above. In the case of multi-electrode devices, individual feedback regulation of ablated energy applied via the electrodes may also be employed. The present invention is believed useful in conjunction with all three approaches </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed toward an improved system for creating lesions and assessing their completeness or transmurality. In particular, the preferred embodiments of the invention are directed toward an improved system for creating elongated lines of lesion and assessing their completeness or transmurality. In the preferred embodiment as disclosed, the apparatus for producing the lesions is an electrosurgical device, in particular a saline-irrigated bipolar electrosurgical forceps. However, the mechanism for assessing lesion transmurality provided by the present invention is believed useful in other contexts, including unipolar R-F ablation and R-F ablation using catheters or hand-held probes. The mechanism for assessing transmurality may also be of value in the context of other types of ablation systems, particularly those which ablation occurs in conjunction with an induced rise in tissue temperature such as those applying ablation energy in the form of microwave radiation, light (laser ablation) or heat (thermal ablation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, assessment of transmurality of a lesion is accomplished by monitoring the impedance of the tissue to be ablated. The inventors have determined that, particularly in the case of a saline-irrigated electrosurgical ablation device, tissue impedance first falls and then reaches a stable plateau, during which portion the lesion is completed. Thereafter, the impedance rises. Rather than attempting to detect a desired drop or a desired increase impedance as described in the above cited Yates, Hassler and Marchlinski patents, the present invention detects completeness of a lesion in response to the measured impedance remaining at a stable level for a desired period of time, hereafter referred to as an impedance plateau. In the context of R-F ablation, measurement of impedance may be done using the ablation electrodes or may be done using dedicated electrodes adjacent to the ablation electrodes. In the context of the other types of ablation discussed above, impedance measurement would typically be accomplished by means of a dedicated set of impedance measurement electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the context of R-F ablation, the invention is believed most valuable in the conjunction with an ablation device having multiple, individually activatable electrodes or electrode pairs to be arranged along a desired line of lesion. In this context, the mechanism for determining transmurality of lesions adjacent individual electrodes or pairs may be used to deactivate individual electrodes or electrode pairs, when the lesions in tissue adjacent these individual electrodes or electrode pairs are complete. This allows the creation of an essentially uniform lesion along the line of electrodes or electrode pairs, regardless of differences in tissue thickness adjacent the individual electrodes or electrode pairs. However, the invention is also believed useful in conjunction with assessment of transmurality of lesions produced by devices having only a single electrode or single electrode pair. Similar considerations apply to the use of the present invention in the contexts of other types of ablation as listed above.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a plan view of a bipolar, saline irrigated electrosurgical hemostat of a type that may be employed in conjunction with the present invention. The hemostat is provided with elongated handles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a lock mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, similar to a conventional surgical hemostat. The handles are connected to one another by pivot or hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and continue distally in the form of elongated jaws <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Jaws <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> carry an elongated electrode or series of electrodes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, respectively, to which ablation energy, e.g. RF energy is applied by means of conductors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The electrodes are adapted to be irrigated by a saline solution or other conductive fluid along their length, provided via inlet tubes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In operation, tissue to be ablated is compressed between the jaws, and RF energy is applied between the electrode or electrode sets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No.: 6,096,037 issued to Mulier et al incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a first embodiment of an electrode arrangement for a hemostat generally as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Illustrated components correspond to identically numbered components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, electrodes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> take the form of elongated coil electrodes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, mounted around porous tubes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, through which saline or other conductive fluid is delivered. The arrangement of the electrodes may also be reversed, for example placing coils <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within elongated porous tubes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, to accomplish a similar result. Alternatively, any other arrangement for providing an elongated electrode and delivery of saline solution along the length thereof may be substituted. The particular configuration of the electrode is not critical to the present invention. For example, irrigated electrodes corresponding to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,037 issued to Mulier, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,398 issued to Mulier, et al., U.S. Pat. No. No. 6,017,378 issued to Brucker, et al or U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,856 issued to Chia, et al., all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties may also be substituted. It should also be noted that while the electrode system as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a bipolar system, the invention may also be employed in conjunction with unipolar electrodes and/or in the form of a probe or a catheter. In some embodiments, irrigation of the electrodes may be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates an alternative embodiment of an electrode system for a hemostat generally as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this case, rather than a single pair of electrodes, multiple electrode pairs are provided. The electrode pairs comprise coil electrodes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. However, other pairings of electrodes might also be substituted, for example, pairing electrodes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, electrodes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or the like. In this embodiment, the electrode pairs are mounted around porous plastic tubes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through which saline or other electrically conductive fluid is delivered. As in the case with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the arrangement of these electrodes may readily be reversed, placing the electrodes within the lumen of plastic tube <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and any other arrangement providing multiple, irrigated electrodes may also be substituted. As in the case of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, unipolar electrodes might be substituted for the multiple bipolar pairs as illustrated and/or the invention may be practiced in conjunction with a multi-electrode probe or catheter. While the particular arrangement of electrodes is not believed critical to practicing the present invention, it is believed that the invention may be most beneficially practiced in conjunction with a set of linearly arranged bipolar electrode pairs as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In use, the hemostat is arranged so that the tissue to be ablated is located between the jaws <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and pressure is applied in order to compress the tissue slightly between the jaws to ensure good electrical contact. All electrode pairs may be activated individually and may be individually deactivated when the lesions between the individual electrode pairs are completely transmural. Alternatively, electrode pairs could be activated sequentially, with one pair deactivated upon a detection of a complete lesion between the electrode pair, followed by activation of the next sequential electrode pair. Corresponding use of the invention in conjunction with a series of unipolar electrodes, for example corresponding to electrodes along one of the two jaws in conjunction with a remote ground plate or a similar series of individually activatable electrodes on a catheter or probe in conjunction with a ground plate is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating measured impedance versus time across tissue located between the electrodes of an irrigated bipolar hemostat as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the drop in impedance followed by an impedance plateau, ultimately followed by an impedance rise. The impedance plateau is the primary indicator of transmurality employed by the present invention. Following the impedance plateau, as tissue is desiccated or as steam forms in the tissue, an impedance rise will generally occur. In some embodiments of the invention, the detection of this rise in impedance is employed as an alternative or mechanism for assessing transmurality and/or as a safety mechanism in order to assure shut off of the ablation electrodes before excessive physical damage to the tissue results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram illustrating one embodiment of an R-F generator system for use in conjunction with the present invention. In this embodiment, separately controllable R-F outputs are provided for individual ablation electrodes or electrode pairs on an associated R-F ablation device, for example as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The R-F generator could of course also be used with ablation devices having only a single electrode or electrode pair as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. With the exception of the electrogram amplitude measurement circuits discussed below, the generator corresponds generally to that described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> of the &apos;961 patent issued to Maguire, et al., cited above. The RF generator disclosed in the &apos;961 patent provides feedback control of R-F power based upon either measured power (constant power) or temperature. The present invention is somewhat easier to implement in conjunction with the constant power mode, but may also be adapted to a temperature-regulated mode or to other feedback power regulation mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Display <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and controls <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> are connected to a digital microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, which permits interface between the user and the remainder of the electrical components of the system. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> operates under control of stored programming defining its operation including programming controlling its operation according to the present invention, as discussed in more detail below. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> provides control outputs to and receives input signals from the remaining circuitry via address/data bus <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. In particular, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> provides for monitoring of power, current, voltage, impedance and temperature. As necessary, the microprocessor will provide this information to the display <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> permits the user to select the control mode (either temperature or power) and to input the power set point, temperature set point, and a timer set point to the system. The primary source of power for the radio-frequency generator may be a 12 V battery rated at 7.2 ampere-hours. Alternatively, the device may be AC powered. A back-up battery (not shown) such as a lithium cell may also be provided to provide sufficient power to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to maintain desired memory functions when the main power is shut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The power supply system as illustrated includes a desired number &ldquo;M&rdquo; of individually controllable R-F power supplies and receives temperature inputs from a desired number &ldquo;N&rdquo; of temperature sensing devices in the ablation device, illustrated schematically at <highlight><bold>838</bold></highlight> and receives temperature inputs from a desired number &ldquo;M&rdquo; of impedance monitoring circuits.

The power measurement circuits (<highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>) multiply the output current and voltage and provide the resulting actual power signal to both the power controllers (<highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>) and the microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Secondary windings of the transformers (<highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight>) may provide for continuous monitoring of the applied voltage in order to permit the power calculations by power measurement circuits (<highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The illustrated power R-F generator system employs software controlled temperature processing, accomplished by micro processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, which receives the &ldquo;N&rdquo; temperature input signals from temperature measurement circuits (<highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>), each of which are coupled to a corresponding temperature sensor in ablation device <highlight><bold>838</bold></highlight> by means of an electrical connector, illustrated schematically at <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight> and interface circuit <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition to the circuitry as described above and disclosed in and disclosed in the Maguire, et al. &apos;961 patent, the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> includes multiple impedance monitoring circuits ZM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, ZM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> . . . ZMM (<highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight> respectively), which may operate as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,281, issued to Nardella, or U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,990, issued to Li, also both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to measure an impedance between electrodes on a RF ablation device. Impedance may be measured between the ablation electrodes or between electrodes located adjacent the ablation electrodes, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,671, incorporated by reference above. Individual impedance measurements made by measurement circuits <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight> are provided to the address/data bus <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and thence to microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> for analysis to determine whether the impedance over time, indicates that the lesion associated with the measured impedance is completely transmural. As discussed in more detail below, a determination of transmurality is made in response to a detection of a series of impedance measurements that are relatively constant, over a desired period of time or over a defined number of successive impedance measurements. In some embodiments, an abrupt rise in impedance may also be employed to terminate delivery of ablation energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to dedicated impedance monitoring circuits, the microprocessor may employ voltage and current measurements of impedance measurement signals generated by the power transformers (<highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight>) to derive impedance and may use such derived impedance values in conjunction with the present invention. For example, measurement of impedance in this fashion is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,681, issued to Struhl, et al, cited above or U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,533, issued to Struhl, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In cases in which an alternative ablation energy generation apparatus is employed, particularly those in which a rise in tissue temperature is induced, e.g. laser, microwave or thermal ablation, the R-F generation circuitry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> would be replaced with a corresponding alternative ablation energy generation apparatus. The measurement of tissue impedance and its use according to the present invention, however, may still be useful in conjunction with these alternative ablation energy generation systems. </paragraph>

The flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates operation of the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to control provision of R-F energy to an individual electrode or electrode pair. In the event that multiple electrodes or electrode pairs are employed, the control methodology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> would be applied to each electrode or electrode pair individually, as discussed in more detail below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates a method of assessing transmurality and terminating delivery of ablation energy to an electrode or an electrode pair responsive to detection of a plateau in impedance in conjunction with a detected drop in impedance. Following the detection of a plateau in conjunction with the required impedance drop, the device waits a defined time period and then terminates the application of ablation energy to the associated electrode pair. Measurement of impedance in tissue associated with the electrode pair may be made using the ablation electrodes themselves or electrodes located in proximity to the ablation electrodes, for example as described in the Yates &apos;671 patent, incorporated by reference above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> After initialization at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) initiates delivery of ablation energy at <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and causes the impedance measurement circuitry associated with the electrode or electrode pair being evaluated or derives impedance based on applied voltage and current as discussed above to acquire a base line or initial impedance Z<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, which may be, for example the maximum impedance during the first three seconds of ablation. At <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> counts &ldquo;n&rdquo; &ldquo;m&rdquo; are reset to zero. The microprocessor thereafter acquires a current impedance value Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The value of &ldquo;n&rdquo; is incremented at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and compared with a predefined value &ldquo;a&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to determine whether a sufficient number of impedances have been measured in order to calculate the rate of change of impedance (dZ/dt). For example, dZ/dt may be calculated by taking the measured impedance Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and comparing it to the preceding measured impedance Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>, in which case n would have to be greater or equal to 2 in order for dZ/dt to be calculated. Alternatively, dZ/dt may be calculated by taking the measured impedance Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and comparing it to the previously measured impedance Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, in which case n would have to be greater or equal to 3 in order for dZ/dt to be calculated. If &ldquo;n&rdquo; is less than &ldquo;a&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor waits an impedance sampling interval &Dgr;t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>which may be, for example, 0.2 seconds, and then triggers an impedance measurement again at <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. This process continues until there are a sufficient number of collected impedance measurements to calculate dZ/dt at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> employs the stored impedance measurements to calculate dZ/dt, which may, for example, be calculated as equal to (1/(2&Dgr;t<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>)) (Z<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&minus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>). The absolute value of dZ/dt, i.e., &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is employed to assess whether or not an impedance plateau has been reached at <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor checks at <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to determine whether &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is less than a defined constant b, indicative of a minimal rate of change of impedance. In the case of an elongated, fluid irrigated ablation electrode similar to that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, for example using an electrode of approximately 5 centimeters in length operated in a constant power mode with a power of less than 27 watts, an appropriate value of &ldquo;b&rdquo; might be 1.0. For other electrode configurations and other power levels, the value of &ldquo;b&rdquo; would have to be adjusted. Other power control modes, e.g. temperature controlled would similarly require adjustment of this parameter. The value of &ldquo;b&rdquo; and other parameters employed to determine transmurality using the present invention can be determined empirically in the laboratory by applying the specific electrode set and R-F generation system in question to test specimens, reading impedances at defined sample intervals and using the results to optimize the various parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the event that &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is sufficiently small in value at 214, the count &ldquo;m&rdquo; is incremented at <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and m is compared to a third constant &ldquo;c&rdquo; which sets forth the defined number of low value &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>measurements required to detect an impedance plateau. For example, in a system as described herein, &ldquo;c&rdquo; may be 6-12. Alternatively, rather than requiring an entire series of measured &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>values to be less than &ldquo;b&rdquo;, a requirement that a defined proportion of the &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>values must be less than &ldquo;b&rdquo; may be substituted, e.g. 8 of 12, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the number of low values of &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is less than &ldquo;c&rdquo; at 218, the microprocessor waits the impedance sampling interval &Dgr;t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and continues to acquire successive impedance measurements until sufficient number of sequential low values of &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>have occurred at 218. At that point, the microprocessor then compares the current impedance value Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>with the initial impedance value Z<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>to determine whether a sufficient impedance drop has occurred. If not, the microprocessor waits for the next impedance sampling interval at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and continues to collect impedance measurements and make calculations of &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>until such time as an impedance plateau is recognized at <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and a sufficient impedance drop is recognized at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. When both of these criteria have been met at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor than waits for an additional time interval &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t2 </subscript></highlight>to assure completeness of the lesion at <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and thereafter terminates the provision of ablation energy to the specific electrode pair being regulated at <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and the ablation process with regard to that electrode or electrode pair is terminated at <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> illustrates an additional set of operations for implementing a transmurality measurement method generally as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. The operations of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> may either be a substituted for step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> or alternatively may be performed before or after step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In the additional operations illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the microprocessor increases the power to the electrodes under consideration slightly at <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and sets a timer at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor then causes the impedance measurement apparatus associated with the electrodes under consideration to measure current impedance at <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and calculate &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, in the same fashion as discussed above. In the event that the value of &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is greater then a defined constant &ldquo;e&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor returns to <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and resets the value of &ldquo;m&rdquo; to zero, essentially reinitializing the search for an impedance plateau. The value of &ldquo;e&rdquo; may be equal to &ldquo;b&rdquo; or may be different. If the value of &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is sufficiently small at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor checks at <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to determine whether the timer has expired. If not, the microprocessor waits the impedance sampling interval &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t1 </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and continues to collect impedance values and calculate &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>values until expiration of the timer at <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, at which point it either terminates ablation at <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> or initiates the waiting period &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t1 </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a second basic approach to assessment of transmurality and control of delivery of ablation energy to an electrode pair. In the same fashion as for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the procedure defined by the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> it should be understood to be employed in conjunction with an impedance measurement circuit with a single electrode pair, which procedure would be repeated for other electrodes or electrode pairs, if present. After initiation at <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the value of &ldquo;n&rdquo; is set to Zero at <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a timer is initiated at <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, used to determine that a sufficient amount of time has passed prior to termination of ablation. For example, in the context of a bipolar irrigated hemostat similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as described above, having electrode lengths of 2 to 5 centimeters and receiving RF energy at a level of 27 watts or less, ten seconds may be an appropriate time interval for the timer initiated at <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor than measures the current impedance Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> increments the value of &ldquo;n&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and checks at <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to determine whether an adequate number of impedance measurements have been accumulated to make a calculation of dZ/dt at <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, in the same fashion as discussed above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>If an inadequate number of samples have been collected, the microprocessor waits the impedance sampling interval &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and continues to collect impedance measurements until an adequate number &ldquo;a&rdquo; of measurement have been collected. In the specific example presented, &ldquo;a&rdquo; may be set equal to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and At may be .<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> seconds. After an adequate number of impedance measurements have been collected at <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor calculates the value of dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In conjunction with the specific mechanism of plateau detection illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, filtered or average impedance values Z<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>may be employed to calculate dZ/dt and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For example, at <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor may calculate the value of dZ/dt according to the following method. The microprocessor may employ a 5 point moving average filter to produce an average impedance value Z<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, which is equal to (Z<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&plus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>&plus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;3</subscript></highlight>&plus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;4</subscript></highlight>)/5. The value of IZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>may be calculated in the same fashion as in conjunction with the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> discussed above, substituting the averaged impedance values Z<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>for the individual impedance values Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>as employed in the previous flow charts. In this case, dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>would be (1/(2&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>)) (Z<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&minus;Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>) and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>would be the absolute value of dZ/dt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may attempt to determine whether an impedance plateau has been reached employing the following method. The microprocessor reviews the preceding 15 measurements of dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and applies three criteria to those values, all three of which must be met in order for an impedance plateau to be detected. For a fluid irrigated hemostat as described, the rules may be as follows: for n&equals;1 to 15; &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>must be less than or equal to 1 for all 15; and for n&equals;1 to 15 the value of dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>must be less than or equal to 0.75, for thirteen of the 15; and for n&equals;1 to 15, &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>must be less than or equal to 0.5, for 10 of the 15. If all of these criteria are met at <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor checks at <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to determine whether an adequate period of time has elapsed since ablation was initiated, if not, the microprocessor waits for the impedance sampling interval &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and continues to measure impedances and calculate values of dZ/dt according to the above described method until both a plateau is present and the defined time period &ldquo;b&rdquo; has elapsed at <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. After the required time period at &ldquo;b&rdquo; at <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> has elapsed, delivery of ablation energy to the associated electrode or electrode pair is terminated at <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the ablation process ceases at <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> as to that electrode pair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, in the event that an impedance plateau fails to manifest itself, the microprocessor may nonetheless safely terminate provision of ablation energy to the electrode pair under consideration in response to a detected rapid rise in impedance, which normally follows the impedance plateau. In the event that a plateau is not detected at <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor checks the preceding stored values of dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>to look for a rapid rise in impedance. For example, a rapid rise in impedance may be detected using the following rule: for n&equals;1 to 10, dZ/dt<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>must be greater than or equal to 1.0 for all 10. If this rapid rise criteria is met at <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the processor checks to see whether the required minimal time period has elapsed at <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, and if so, terminates ablation at <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> as discussed above. If the minimal time interval &ldquo;b&rdquo; has not elapsed, the microprocessor continues to acquire measurements of impedance and continues to calculate values of dZ/dt and &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>until either an impedance plateau is detected at <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> or a rapid rise in impedance is detected at <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the minimum time interval has expired at <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, all the electrodes are activated simultaneously and individual electrodes or electrode pairs are deactivated in response to impedance measurements associated with the electrode pair indicating that the lesion formed between that electrode pair is completely transmural. In this circumstance, the ablation system works as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After initialization at <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, all electrodes 1&minus;x are activated at <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, meaning that ablation energy is provided to all electrodes and electrode pairs. The microprocessor then checks the value of dZ/dt and/or &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar; at the first of the electrode pairs at <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, using any of the mechanisms discussed above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor checks using any of the mechanisms described above to determine whether an impedance plateau has been reached or, in the event that additional criteria for shut off of ablation energy are provided, to see whether any of these additional criteria are reached. If so, the electrode being examined is deactivated at <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by ceasing the delivery of ablation energy to the electrode or electrode pair. If not, the microprocessor checks the value of dZ/dt and/or &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar; for the next electrode at <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. This process continues until all electrodes are deactivated at <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, after which the procedure is deemed complete at <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and the ablation process is terminated at <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a functional flow chart of overall operation of a device in which a multi-electrode or multi-electrode pair ablation apparatus is employed, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, however, electrodes or electrode pairs are activated initially and sequentially. After initialization at <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor activates delivery of ablation energy to the first electrode at <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, checks dZ/dt and/or &verbar;dZ/dt&verbar; at <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and, in the same manner as described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> above, checks to determine whether the impedance plateau criteria and/or other criteria as described above have been met. If so, the electrode is deactivated at <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. If not, application of ablation energy continues until the plateau criterion or other criteria are met as described above. After deactivation of an electrode at <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor checks to determine whether all electrodes have been activated and deactivated at <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, if not, the microprocessor then activates the next electrode at <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and initiates delivery of ablation energy to that electrode. This process continues until the last electrode has been deactivated at <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, following which the microprocessor determines that the ablation process is complete at <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and the ablation process is stopped at <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The overall operational methodology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is believed to be desirable in that it allows for a more rapid completion of an ablation procedure. However, the overall operational method is described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has the advantage that it may allow the use of a somewhat simplified generator because that multiple, separate impedance measurement circuits, power control circuits, and the like need not be provided for each electrode or electrode pair. A simple switching mechanism may be used in conjunction with only a single RF generator and impedance measurement circuit to successively apply energy to each electrode and to monitor impedance according to the invention.</paragraph>
