<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">High solubility of pristine single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes using electron donors as solubilizers has been observed. The resulting carbon nanotube solution can be readily diluted with other organic solvents, such as acetone, toluene and methanol. SEM after solvent evaporation clearly shows that nanotubes are still present after being subjected to this procedure. Electronic absorption of these solutions is observed in both the UV and visible region. Strong light emission (&equals;0.30) was observed at 561 nm for dilute solutions of aniline-dissolved carbon nanotubes diluted with acetone. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for dissolving nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes and solutions for carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nanostructured materials, such as carbon nanotubes (NTs) have been the subject of much research in recent years because their unique electronic, mechanical and physical properties can be used in all areas of science.<highlight><superscript>1,2 </superscript></highlight>Nanostructured tubes are becoming increasingly important because their mechanical properties, notably strength, stiffness, and toughness, make them useful in a variety of applications. Composites made from carbon nanotubes have superior strength and stiffness per weight, and thus are already being used in aerospace and sporting goods applications. Carbon nanotubes are also excellent electron emitters, emitting electrons at very low voltage, which makes them particularly useful in the field of flat panel displays. Their good electron conductivity and high thermal conductivity also make carbon nanotubes ideal materials for making anti-static and/or anti-corrosion coatings as well as thermal conductors. Additionally, carbon nanotubes can be used in electronic circuits where silicon and other standard semiconductor materials do not work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Carbon nanotubes are particularly stable because of the strength with which the carbon atoms bond together. In nanotubes, the carbon atoms arrange themselves in hexagonal rings, similar to the arrangement in graphite. In fact, a nanotube resembles a sheet or several stacked sheets of graphite rolled into a seamless cylinder. Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes are difficult to dissolve or disperse in most organic or inorganic solvents because of their long structured features, large molecular size, or severe aggregation. The common agents used to help disperse carbon nanotubes are surfactants, which, however, can only increase the dispersibility to a limited extent, and surfactants do not affect the solubility of carbon nanotubes. Attaching alkyl groups to the surface of carbon nanotubes can increase their solubility to some extent. This approach, however, requires tedious chemical reactions, and the chemical functionalization may alter the structure or affect properties of the carbon nanotubes. In another approach, carbon nanotubes were wrapped with a helical polymer, through which they were brought into other solvents. This method, however, can only be applied in very limited circumstances. The size of soluble nanotubes depends upon the size of the helices of the polymer, and it is tedious to synthesize these polymers. This difficulty in dispersing or dissolving carbon nanotubes limits the ability to incorporate carbon nanotubes in other organic or inorganic materials as well as the ability to manipulate them chemically and characterize them quantitatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Some solution properties of carbon nanotubes have also been studied, aimed at their chemical modification and functionalization.<highlight><superscript>3-6 </superscript></highlight>Several methods have been reported for making solubilized NTs, including attachment of long alkyl chains<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and incorporation with polymers.<highlight><superscript>4,5 </superscript></highlight>Haddon et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,823, disclose a method of dissolving single-walled nanotube carbons in organic solvents by directly functionalizing the nanotubes with amines or alkylaryl amines having an uninterrupted carbon chain of at least five and, more preferably, nine carbon atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite those attempts, the dissolution of pristine carbon nanotubes, to our knowledge, has not been realized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to overcome the deficiencies in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a low cost, efficient way to solubilize nanotube materials. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to make solutions of carbon nanotubes using a class of small organic molecules as dissolution or dispersing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to incorporate carbon nanotubes with organic polymers to make nanocomposites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide enhanced light emission of LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to produce solar cells and magnetoelectric shielding using nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to make field emission devices using solubilized carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, nanotube materials can be dissolved in a variety of solvents by treating carbon nanotubes with an electron donor, such as an aromatic amine. The electron donor acts to solubilize the nanotubes in the solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Once the carbon nanotubes are dissolved in these aromatic amines, the carbon nanotubes can be readily dissolved in other polar or nonpolar organic solvents, including but not limited to solvents such as chloroform, acetone, toluene, benzene, methanol, ethanol, DMF, TMF, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Dissolving carbon nanotubes in polar or nonpolar solvents using small electron donor molecules modifies the surface property of the carbon nanotubes and results in improved chemical interaction between modified nanotube and polymers, so that superior composite materials are produced.</paragraph>

As in the interaction of primary and secondary amines with C<highlight><subscript>60</subscript></highlight>,<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>this may be followed by proton transfer from aniline to the fullerene, (see Scheme 1). The NT-aniline complex (or adduct) is quite stable, even after three months, as shown by the persistence of the new spectral features. In contrast, no measurable dissolution of carbon nanotubes was observed in nitrobenzene, an electron acceptor. Solubilization was also observed between N,N-dimethylaniline(DMA) and NTs, but the process may not be the same as with aniline, since adduct formation by proton transfer between DMA and the NTs is not possible. The fluorescence spectrum of DMA-NT solutions is also much weaker than the NT-aniline solutions, indicating a different species is produced. The observation that dissolution of NTs in aniline requires higher temperatures than is needed for interaction of amines with fullerenes is reasonable considering not only the difference in molecular size, but also the fact that nanotubes have a very strong tendency to aggregate, which is one reason why they are insoluble in most common solvents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Strong fluorescence was observed upon exciting the diluted SWNT-aniline solutions at 500 nm. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the emission spectra solutions in acetone, toluene and methanol, respectively. The maximum emission in acetone was observed at 565 nm with a shoulder at 610 nm. In methanol the emission is red-shifted by 20 nm with no change in intensity. The shift of the emission maximum in polar vs. nonpolar solvents is consistent with charge separation in the excited state. The fluorescence excitation spectra are quite different from the absorption spectra of the individual components, indicating the formation of a new light-absorbing species. The quantum yield of fluorescence of SWNT-aniline in acetone is 0.30,<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>considerably higher than that of aromatic molecules such as phenanthrene (0.10) and naphthalene (0.11), but similar to that of anthracene (0.29).

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, it appears that a new chemical species is produced on heating SWNT in aniline, and that photoexcitation of this species leads to a luminescent charge separated state (exciplex). In polymer-bound carbon nanotubes, Riggs et al. rationalized that the luminescence might be due to the trapping of the excitation energy at defect sites.<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Another factor that might enhance the fluorescence efficiency of nanotubes is their large molecular size, which would inhibit deactivation through molecular motion. In this respect, studies with purified NTs of different types and sizes would be informative.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> To produce an improved luminescent material, a solution of carbon nanotubes and an electron donor compound is mixed with an appropriate fluorescent or luminescent polymer. For purposes of the present invention, a fluorescent substance is one that absorbs radiant energy of certain wavelengths and, after a fleeting instant, gives off part of the absorbed energy as quanta of longer wavelengths. Most fluorescent pigments are of the toluenesulfonamide-melamine-formaldehyde resin matrix type. A mixture of o- and p- toluenesulfonamide, paraformaldehdye, and a B-stage unmodified melamine-formaldehyde resin is heated together. Fluorescent dyes such as Rhodamine F3B, Rhodamine 6GDN, or Brilliant Yellow 6G Base are added along with a dispersion or solution of carbon nanotubes and an electron emitting molecule, and heating continued. The finished colored resin is clear, brittle, and friable, and can be pulverized by impact milling to a fine powder, which is the final fluorescent pigment which can be used in a wide variety of applications. The presence of the carbon nanotubes imparts superior fluorescence to the pigment. The use of the electron donor compound makes it possible to disperse the carbon nanotubes uniformly in the polymer composition so that a uniform pigment is produced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a simple, economical way to disperse or dissolve nanotube materials in solvents so that the nanotube materials can be used in a variety of applications. The nanotubes in solution or dispersion form can be coated onto substrates or mixed into a variety of other materials, including polymers, to form composites with outstanding characteristics. For example, a high-current field emitter can be made by forming a dispersion of nanotubes as described in the above examples and mixing the dispersion into a composite paste with suitable polymeric resins. This paste is then smeared onto an electrode. When voltage is applied, some of the nanotubes in the layer point toward the opposite electrode and emit electrons. Composites of nanotubes are formed from producing a solution of nanotubes and coating this solution onto control electronics. Phophor-coated glass is placed on top to make a flat-panel display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An electron emitter composition according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises carbon nanotubes as electron emitting materials. The composition also comprises a binder, dispersing agent, and water. The amount of the electron emitting material is preferably 1 to 50% by weight, more preferably 5 to 30% by weight, and most preferably 10 to 20% by weight, of the total composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To produce a field emission device using carbon nanotubes, nanotubes are dispersed in a dispersion agent such as polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl ether derivative, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc., with the aid of an electron donor molecule as described above. This mixture is then added to a binding composition, such as a silane based compound or colloidal silica, and the composition is bound to a cathode electrode made of silver, ITO, etc. Water can be used as the dispersion medium. Additional details of this production, with the exception of dispersion of the nanotubes with an electron donor molecule, can be found in Jin et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,250,984, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The use of an electron donor compound to disperse the nanotubes provides improved dispersion so that a more uniform device can be prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Additionally, nanotube solutions can be used for the formation of nano-composites or cast into thin films, which would solve the practical problems involved in making nanotube-based electronic and field emission display devices.<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>The strong fluorescence emission of carbon nanotubes should also be a useful probe in elucidation of the physical and biological properties of these materials. The process of the present invention makes it possible to manipulate nanotubes in order to produce desirable electronic and other types of devices. For example, when two slightly dissimilar nanotube molecules are joined together end to end, the &ldquo;junction&rdquo; between them functions as a diode. Diodes are the basis of receivers, which convert alternating current into direct current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As more and smaller transistors are placed onto computer chips, the heat they generate could melt the silicon substrate. Nanotubes can be attached to chips to draw away heat, allowing them to run cooler. Additionally, as the transistors become smaller, so do the thin metal wires connecting them, making them more likely to break. Nanotubes can be used as replacement wires, as they are much stronger and thinner than metal wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Researchers at IBM have already used nanotubes to produce a transistor. Nanotubes can be formed from condensed carbon vapor, and they are only 1/50,000th as thick as a human hair. When the carbon rings of the nanotube line up with the main axis of the nanotube, the nanotube conducts electricity as well as a metal. When the pattern of hexagonal rings in a nanotube is twisted, the nanotube acts like a semiconductor, i.e., it conducts electricity only after a certain threshold. When two nanotubes, one a conductor and one semiconductor, are joined into one molecule, their junction acts like a diode, permitting electric current to flow in only one direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Nanotubes dissolved or dispersed with the aid of an electron donor molecule can readily be used to fabricate electron emitting sources such as described in Uemura et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,547, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. This electron emitting source is produced from carbon nanotubes formed from a columnar graphite layer in which a plurality of carbon nanotubes aggregate to form a needle-like structure. The electron-emitting source can be made by recessing a substrate and filling the recess with a solution or dispersion of carbon nanotubes which have been dissolved or dispersed with the aid of an electron donor molecule. Alternatively, a paste is formed by dispersing the carbon nanotubes in a conductive viscous solution with the aid or an electron donor molecule. This paste is used to form a pattern on a substrate. The use of the electron donor molecule makes it easy to disperse the nanotubes in the conductive solution so that the nanotubes are distributed evenly in the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Small amounts of nanotubes can be added to plastics to make the resin electrically conductive. Because the present invention makes it possible to dissolve or disperse nanotubes, the nanotubes can readily be evenly distributed throughout a resin composition. Alternatively, nanotubes can be incorporated into plastics to make them antistatic, or for use in EMI shielding. Nonlimiting examples of such polymers include epoxy resins, polyolefins, polyvinylchloride, polyacrylinitrile, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl acetate, polyester, polystyrene, polyamide, and mixtures and copolymers thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While nanotubes are about 100 times as strong as steel, they are too small to use as individual fibers. However, they can be assembled into bits of &ldquo;rope&rdquo;. Being able to disperse the nanotubes evenly by the process of the present invention makes it much easier to assemble the nanotube &ldquo;ropes.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Self-oriented bundles of carbon nanotubes, such as those disclosed in Dai et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,706, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, can be produced from carbon nanotubes which have been dispersed or dissolved in a fluid using an electron donor molecule. A silicon substrate is electrochemically etched to form a thin nanoporous layer on top of a macroporous layer. A dispersion or solution of carbon nanotubes with an electron donor molecule is deposited in a predetermined pattern on the substrate. This deposition is repeated until the carbon naotubes are deposited on the substrate in sufficient quantity to produce a superior field emission device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described above, the treated carbon nanotubes according to the present invention have much stronger light emission properties than untreated carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Nanotubes of differing sizes and configurations can be more easily separated after dissolution. The dissolved carbon nanotubes are applied to gel chromatography (gel permeation, affinity, or size exclusion) and eluted with different solvents. Because of the structural differences among different nanotubes, the ability to bind with the gel will differ, and the tubes can be washed out with common solvents. </paragraph>
