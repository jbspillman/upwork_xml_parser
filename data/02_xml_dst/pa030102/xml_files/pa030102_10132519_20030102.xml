<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for manufacturing an optical member by vapor depositing an antireflective film on a plastic optical member and vapor depositing a water-repellent thin film over the antireflective film. The vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film is conducted by evaporating a fluorine-containing organic silicon compound in which the plastic optical member does not exceed the maximum temperature during the vapor deposition of antireflective film. The heating for evaporation comprises a first stage where the temperature is raised from an ordinary temperature to the prescribed temperature (1) not exceeding the starting temperature of vapor deposition of said compound, and the second stage where the temperature is raised from said prescribed temperature (1) to the prescribed temperature (2) equal to or higher than said starting temperature of vapor deposition. The rate of raising temperature of the first stage of raising temperature is higher than that of the second stage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a plastic optical member having an antireflective film and a water-repellent film. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An antireflective film formed by the vapor deposition of multiple layers of inorganic oxides is generally provided on optical members such as plastic lenses. This multilayer vapor-deposited film is generally comprised of, for example, a high refractive index layer of ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or the like, and a low refractive index layer of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, AlO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or the like, with the outermost layer generally being the low refractive index layer. Thus, grime from sweat and fingerprints tend to adhere, and such grime is often difficult to remove. As methods of solving this problem, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Nos. Showa 60-221470 and 62-148902 disclose methods of soaking and curing, or coating and curing, a resin (optical substrate) in a diluted solution of perfluoroalkyl-group substituted ammonium silane to form a water-repellent film over an antireflective film. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 5-215905 discloses a method of forming a thin film over an antireflective film from a diluted solution of m-xylene hexachloride by vacuum vapor deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 5-215905 proposes a method wherein a porous material in the form of a sintered filter obtained by sintering a highly thermally conductive metal powder of copper or the like is impregnated with a water-repellency treatment solution obtained by diluting a fluorine-containing silazane organic silicon compound with a fluorine solvent such as xylylene hexafluoride, trichloromonofluoromethane, or the like; and applying heat during vacuum vapor deposition to form a film on an optical member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The water-repellency of the thin films formed by the methods disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Showa Nos. 60-221470 and 62-148902 has drawbacks in the form of poor durability and water repellency that drops precipitously with use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By contrast, the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 05-215905 improves durability and characteristics of change over time in comparison with the conventional methods by vacuum vapor deposition of an organic silicon compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 05-215905 is of high molecular weight and has a high boiling point. Accordingly, because heating to an elevated temperature is required when employing vacuum vapor deposition, depending on the heating conditions, there are possibilities that the surface temperature of the optical member may be raised by the influence of the heat and damages such as thermal cracking of the antireflective layer may be caused. In particular, since the boiling point increases further when the degree of vacuum is low, the influence of the heat becomes significant. Further examples of water-repellent agents comprising fluorine-containing organic silicon compounds are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei Nos. 9-157582, 9-202648 and 9-263728. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since the compounds disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei Nos. 9-157582, 9-202648 and 9-263728 have a high fluorine content, improvement in water repellency, durability and the like can be anticipated. However, since the molecular weight thereof is even greater, the boiling point increases further, and the influence of heat is even greater than in the compound disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 05-215905. Further, since more time is required in the bonding reaction to the antireflective film for these compounds than for the compound disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Heisei No. 05-215905, it was difficult to set the vapor deposition conditions. To reduce the influence of heat, it suffices to raise the temperature rapidly; however, depending on the vapor deposition conditions, nonuniformity sometimes occurs in the water-repellent film formed due to the short vapor deposition time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, a vapor deposition device is employed to form the antireflective film on optical members such as plastic lenses when the antireflective film is a multilayer vapor deposited film comprised of inorganic oxides. Accordingly, when forming a water-repellent film by vapor deposition method on an antireflective film formed by such a vapor deposition device, it is desirable to continuously form the antireflective film and the water-repellent film. However, as set forth above, in optical members provided with antireflective films, damages in the form of thermal cracking and the like sometimes occur depending on the temperature conditions during the formation of the water-repellent film, and problems particularly tend to occur due to the high temperature of vapor deposition when continuously forming a water repellent film by vapor deposition of a fluorine-containing organic silicon compound with a high boiling point due to the comparatively high molecular weight as mentioned above, and an antireflective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When conducting such continuous vapor deposition in a single vapor deposition chamber, if the antireflective film adheres over the water-repellent film adhering to the inner walls of the vapor deposition chamber, the antireflective film that has adhered over water-repellent film tends to peel off because the antireflective film tends not to adhere to the water-repellent film. When this adheres to the lens during film formation, flawed film formation sometimes results. Thus, the idea of using a continuous processing device separated into a vapor deposition chamber for vapor deposition of the antireflective film (&ldquo;first vapor deposition chamber&rdquo; hereinafter) and a vapor deposition chamber for vapor deposition of the water-repellent film (&ldquo;second vapor deposition chamber&rdquo; hereinafter) was conceived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in such a device, an opening and closing mechanism for retrieving the vapor deposited product and a mechanism for conveying the vapor deposited product are sometimes provided in the second vapor deposition chamber. Thus, there are cases that there is not enough distance between the vapor deposition substance and the vapor deposited product, and irregularities in the water-repellent film develop due to these mechanisms being impediments when the vapor deposition substance is evaporated rapidly. Further, since the chamber must be opened each time a vapor deposited product is removed and heat dispersion efficiency must be increased by reducing the degree of vacuum for cooling prior to retrieval, a degree of vacuum may be low in the second vapor deposition chamber. In such a case, the starting temperature of vapor deposition increases and there is a possibility that the above-described problems tend to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a plastic optical member having a water-repellent thin film with good water repellency, durability, abrasion resistance and the like on an antireflective layer, wherein a water repellent film is formed, continuously with forming an antireflective film, by vacuum vapor deposition using a fluorine-containing organic silicon compound with a high boiling point due to its relatively high molecular weight, as set forth above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing an optical member of the present invention, an antireflective film is vapor deposited on a plastic optical member and then a water-repellent film is vapor deposited on the antireflective film; this method is particularly suited to the vapor deposition of water-repellent films under low degree of vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Vapor deposition processing methods generally comprise methods conducted with a batch-type vacuum vapor deposition device and methods conducted with a continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition method. The present invention is particularly suited to methods with continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition devices. The continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition device employed in the present invention is desirably provided with a vacuum vapor deposition chamber for antireflective films continuously with a vacuum vapor deposition chamber for water-repellent thin films. Sequentially providing an antireflective film processing chamber and a water-repellent film processing chamber in this manner permits efficient processing and short cycle time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing method according to the present invention, as described further below, since vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film is conducted under a degree of vacuum lower than the degree of vacuum in the vapor deposition of the antireflective film, the water-repellent film processing chamber can be employed as a vacuum breaking chamber of a continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition device. Continuously conducting the vapor deposition of the antireflective film and the water-repellent thin film can reduce adhesion to the lens surface of grime resulting from vapor deposition substances in the vacuum chamber, results in more stable production of water-repellent processing films, and also improves the process-yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method according to the present invention will be described based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic view of the flow of vapor deposition processing in a continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the figure, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes a preheating chamber (CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> denotes first vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> denotes second vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> denote lens supporting jig platforms supporting lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. First, a lens is held in the lens mounting opening <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of support jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this state, lens support jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is loaded onto lens supporting jig platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> positioned on the opening and closing platform of the preheating chamber and transferred to preheating chamber (CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with closing opening and closing platform of the preheating chamber. After raising a degree of vacuum in preheating chamber (CH<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, heating is conducted to a temperature suited to vapor deposition and lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transferred to first vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In first vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, vapor deposition substance (A) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for antireflective film is heated by heating source <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and an antireflective film is vapor deposited. During vapor deposition, lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is rotated to vapor deposit multiple lenses uniformly. After vapor deposition of the antireflective film has been completed, lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transferred to second vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In second vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is loaded onto lens supporting jig platform <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on opening and closing platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of second vapor deposition chamber. In second vapor deposition chamber (CH<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, vapor deposition substance (B) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for water-repellent thin film is heated by heating device <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to vapor deposit a water-repellent thin film. During the vapor deposition, the lens supporting jig is also rotated to vapor deposit multiple lenses uniformly. After vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film has been completed, the product is left standing for a prescribed time to lower the temperature, after which opening and closing platform <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of second vapor deposition chamber falls down and lenses on which antireflective films and water-repellent thin films have been formed are retrieved from lens supporting jig <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing optical members according to the present invention, the vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film is conducted by heating and evaporating a fluorine-containing organic silicon compound under the condition where the temperature of said plastic optical member does not exceed the maximum temperature at which the plastic optical member is exposed during the vapor deposition of said antireflective film, and adhering the evaporated fluorine-containing organic silicon compound on the plastic optical member having said antireflective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The surface of the plastic optical member during vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film is set to not exceed the maximum temperature of the plastic optical member exposed during the vapor deposition of said antireflective film. This advantageously prevents thermal cracking of the antireflective film. The maximum temperature of the plastic optical member (optical member surface) during vapor deposition of the antireflective film normally falls within a range of 85 to 110&deg; C., and the temperature of the surface of the optical member during vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film is desirably 15 to 25&deg; C. lower. The degree of vacuum during vapor deposition of the water-repellent thin film can be comparatively low, for example, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The heating during vapor deposition of the water repellent thin film is conducted so as to comprise the first stage of raising temperature where the temperature is raised from an ordinary temperature to the prescribed temperature (1) not exceeding the starting temperature of vapor deposition of said fluorine-containing organic compound, and the second stage of raising temperature where the temperature is raised from said prescribed temperature (1) to the prescribed temperature (2) equal to or higher than said starting temperature of vapor deposition, with the rate of raising temperature of the first stage of raising temperature higher than the rate of raising temperature of the second stage of raising temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The temperature at which evaporation of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound starts is determined by the type (molecular weight and composition) of fluorine-containing organic silicon compound, degree of vacuum and the like. However, in the case of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound represented by general formula (I) described further below, the temperature at which evaporation starts at a degree of vacuum of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr falls within a range of about 470-620&deg; C. In the case of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound represented by general formula (II), the temperature at which evaporation starts at a degree of vacuum of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr falls within a range of about 420-570&deg; C. Further, the prescribed temperature (1) that is lower than the temperature at which evaporation of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound starts is desirably, for example, 10-20&deg; C. lower than the temperature at which evaporation of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound starts in view of controlling the rate of evaporation to achieve uniform film formation on multiple optical members. Further, the prescribed temperature (2) that is equal to or higher than the temperature at which evaporation starts is also desirably 40-60&deg; C. higher than the prescribed temperature (1) in view of controlling the rate of evaporation to achieve uniform film formation on multiple optical members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The rate of raising temperature in the first stage of raising temperature is set to greater than the rate of raising temperature in the second stage of raising temperature. Since the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound employed in the manufacturing method of the present invention is of comparatively high molecular weight, it has a high evaporation temperature. Thus, there is a possibility that a large quantity of fluorine-containing compound will evaporate in a short period when the temperature is increased rapidly, resulting in nonuniformity in the water-repellent thin film obtained. However, when heating is conducted with a rate of raising temperature that is gradual from the start, not only the time required for vapor deposition increase and production efficiency decrease, but also heat spreads to the substrate positioned in the vapor deposition chamber, imparting thermal influences (for example, heat cracking and the like in the antireflective film) to the substrate and antireflective film that has been formed on the substrate. Accordingly, to shorten the period of heating the vapor deposited composition and form a uniform film, temperature is raised sharply in the first stage of raising temperature at which the temperature is lower than an evaporation temperature range. In the second stage of raising temperature including the evaporation temperature range, temperature is raised with a moderate gradient. The rate of raising temperature in the second stage of raising temperature preferably ranges from 0.4&deg; C./s to 1.7&deg; C./s in view of forming films on multiple optical members uniformly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fluorine-containing organic silicon compound is charged to a suitable container and evaporated by heating. Evaporation of the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound is desirably conducted by heating a porous material impregnated with the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound with a heating means. The fluorine-containing organic silicon compound is dissolved in a suitable fluorine solvent, the solution obtained is impregnated into the porous material, the solvent is removed if necessary, and the product is subjected to heating and vapor deposition. The use of a porous material permits the achievement of a suitable vapor deposition rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Examples of the solvents used to dilute the fluorine-containing organic silicon compound include m-xylene hexafluoride, perfluorohexane and hydrofluoroether. A concentration ranging from 1-10 percent is suitable. The fluorine compound solution may be charged to a container and heated as it is, but it is further desirable to impregnate into a porous material. This is because heat can be uniformly transmitted and a suitable evaporation rate can be achieved to form a uniform film without individual variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> More specifically, fluorine compound (I) or (II) is heated and evaporated under vacuum to form a thin film on optical members. Basically, the thickness of the thin film changes depending on the amount of fluorine compound (I) or (II) that is evaporated. Further, in the present invention, since a thin film having good water repellency without compromising the characteristics of the antireflective film can be obtained by controlling the thickness of the thin film at the Angstrom level, it is desirable to more precisely regulate the amount of fluorine compound (I) or (II) that is evaporated. Accordingly, to more precisely apportion the compound, fluorine compound (I) or (II) dissolved in a fluorine solvent such as perfluorohexane or hydrofluoroether can be used. Diluting fluorine compound (I) or (II) facilitates impregnation into the porous material. The concentration of fluorine compound (I) or (II) in the solution can be suitably determined based on the type of fluorine compound (I) or (II) or the like. A degree of dilution of 1-10 percent is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the porous material can be a sintered filter obtained by sintering a metal powder of high thermal conductivity such as copper or stainless steel. Further, in view of achieving a suitable vapor deposition rate, a porous material mesh of 40-200 microns, preferably 80-120 microns, is suitable. Regulation of the vapor deposition rate within a range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>mg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>second to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>mg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>second is desirable to achieve a uniform thin film. Adjustment of the above-stated conditions permits achieving a vapor deposition rate falling within this range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As a method for heating said fluorine-containing organic silicon compound, a method where a sample that has been placed on a resistance heating source in the form of a boat is heated and a method where heating is conducted by directly irradiating a weak electron beam can be used. A method where indirect heating is conducted by heating a heating stage made of copper, molybdenum or the like by an infrared irradiation source such as halogen heater can be used, which is more preferred in view of stable vapor deposition rate and vapor deposition distribution without sudden temperature change near the target temperature. Further, stable production can be implemented through device size reduction and increased maintenance efficiency. </paragraph>

Thus, there is a possibility of the antireflective film being affected by heat. When the temperature is raised sharply to prevent this, there is a possibility of nonuniformity developing due to the evaporation of a large quantity of fluorine compound in a short period. Accordingly, in the manufacturing method according to the present invention, as set forth above, the temperature is raised with a moderate gradient to evaporate in the evaporation temperature range of the fluorine compound (second stage of raising temperature). In the case of fluorine compound (I), the second stage of raising temperature is conducted within a temperature range of 450 to 660&deg; C. </paragraph>

The continuous-type vacuum vapor deposition device equipped with independent preheating chamber, first vapor deposition chamber, and second vapor deposition chamber shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was employed as the vacuum vapor deposition device. The above-mentioned plastic lens was installed on the lens supporting jig, introduced into the preheating chamber (CH1), heated for a prescribed period under vacuum, and transferred to the first vapor deposition chamber (CH2) already in a state of vacuum without contact with external air by an internally provided conveyor.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The temperature was linearly raised over 3 minutes 10 seconds to 525&deg; C. with a program controller (rate of raising temperature about 2.63&deg; C./s). Irregularities in static contact angle and interference color were confirmed in the same manner as in Example 5 for the lens thus produced. Table 1 shows the physical properties of the lens with water-repellent film. As a result, it was found that irregularities were large. It is considered that the nonuniform adhesion of the vapor deposited film was attributed to the short evaporation time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The temperature was linearly raised over 10 minutes to 525&deg; C. using a program controller (rate of raising temperature about 0.83&deg; C./s). Otherwise, the same procedure was conducted as in Example 3. Irregularities in static contact angle and interference color were confirmed in the same manner as in Example 5. Table 1 shows the results. The static contact angle was about the same value as in Example 3. Although there was few irregularities, the antireflective film cracked. It is considered that the rise in lens surface temperature was attributed to the long period of heating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A plastic lens with an antireflective film was placed in a batch-type vacuum vapor deposition device (comprising a single vapor deposition chamber) and vapor deposition was conducted. The same procedure as in Example 1 was conducted until the antireflective film was vapor deposited. Vapor deposition treatment agent 2 was charged to a metal container with electrodes and the temperature was raised over 45 seconds to 235&deg; C. The degree of vacuum was 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. In this case, since the degree of vacuum was high, it was possible to raise the temperature quickly at a low evaporation starting temperature. Further, since it was possible to achieve adequate distance between the vapor deposition source and the vapor deposited product in this type of vapor deposition device, and there were few impediments, no irregularity was made even if the rate of raising temperature was fast. Table 1 shows the physical characteristics of the lens with water-repellent film that was obtained. </paragraph>
