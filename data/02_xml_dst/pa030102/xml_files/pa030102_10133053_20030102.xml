<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to calcium fortified protein-containing products, processes for making such products; and concentrated calcium solutions used in making such products. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition to being the basic building block of bones and teeth, calcium is required for blood coagulation and the proper functioning of the heart, nerves, and muscles. As many individuals, especially elderly individuals, do not obtain sufficient levels of calcium from their diets, calcium supplementation is desired. A preferred method of increasing calcium intake is to replace,fluids that are normally consumed, with calcium-fortified versions of such fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, the development of calcium-fortified products has met with numerous obstacles. With respect to beverages in particular, attempts at producing calcium fortified protein-containing beverages have resulted in products that have low soluble calcium concentrations; suspension settlement issues; unacceptable off flavors that are described as bitter, metallic, chalky, and mineral-like; poor textures as a result of added stabilizers or chelating agents; or a combination of these drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to having low soluble calcium concentrations and poor organoleptic properties, it is known that current calcium fortified protein-containing beverages require stabilizers, chelating agents, and special production processes, as when such beverages are pasteurized after being fortified, their proteins are destabilized. Such destabilization typically results in protein flocculation and calcium settlement issues that become problematic at higher levels of calcium fortification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As a result of the aforementioned product and product processing problems, it is clear that there remains a need for a stable, hedonically acceptable calcium fortified protein-containing beverage that effectively and efficiently delivers calcium. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a calcium fortified protein-containing product comprising, in addition to any soluble calcium that is inherently present in the product, a quantity of soluble calcium. Surprisingly, such product does not require an added stabilizer or chelating agent to achieve high levels of soluble calcium and product stability. However, when such materials are employed, surprisingly higher levels of soluble calcium may be obtained. The invention also relates to foods and beverages containing such products, as well as concentrated calcium solutions used to produce such beverages and processes for producing same are also disclosed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A. Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;additional soluble calcium&rdquo; means the amount of soluble calcium in a product that results from fortification (i.e., excludes the soluble calcium present in the product prior to calcium fortification). A method for measuring additional soluble calcium is described in Analytical Method 2, infra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;essentially zero weight %&rdquo; with respect to a given material means the material is included at a level that one skilled in the art would recognize as being less than functional to achieve the stated or recognized purpose for such material. For example, if a material that is otherwise known as a beverage stabilizer is included in a beverage such that it provides some level of stabilization, yet the skilled artisan would recognize that there is insufficient levels of the material to stabilize the entire product in question, then the material would be at a level of &ldquo;essentially zero weight %.&rdquo; Thus, unless otherwise stated, &ldquo;essentially zero weight %&rdquo; is a qualitative not quantitative term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;free organic acids&rdquo; means organic acids that are added to a neutralized meta-stable calcium complex or solution comprising such complex, after such complex or solution is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;heat treating&rdquo; refers to treatment processes wherein beverages or beverage components are heated, to temperatures and for periods of time sufficient to inactivate enzymes and to destroy microorganisms, without substantial alteration of the chemical composition or sensory characteristics of the treated composition. The term heat treating encompasses the terms &ldquo;pasteurize&rdquo;, &ldquo;pasteurization&rdquo;, &ldquo;sterilize&rdquo; and &ldquo;sterilization&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;protein-containing products&rdquo; encompasses products containing or derived from milk from mammals, including cows and goats; plant materials, including soy beans; and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;stable&rdquo; means stable according to Applicants&apos; Analytical Method 4, which is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Except as otherwise noted, the articles &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;an&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the&rdquo; mean &ldquo;one or more&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Unless stated otherwise, all product characteristics stated herein are as determined using Applicants&apos; analytical methods. All such analytical methods are found in the Analytical Methods Section of this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> B. Stable Calcium Fortified Protein Containing Beverages </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A key advantage of Applicants&apos; invention is that Applicants&apos; embodiments, particularly those that are beverages, comprise far greater amounts of soluble calcium than conventional calcium fortified protein-containing beverages. Certain embodiments of Applicants&apos; beverage-related invention comprise as much or more soluble calcium as current calcium fortified milks, yet unlike these beverages, Applicants&apos; beverage invention does not require added stabilizers or chelating agents. When stabilizers are introduced and such beverage&apos;s pH is adjusted in accordance with the teachings contained herein, a stable beverage having organoleptic properties similar to an unfortified beverage can be produced. As a result, certain embodiments of Applicants&apos; beverage invention can provide the combined benefits of high levels of soluble calcium, product stability and superior organoleptic properties. In addition to being consumed neat, Applicants&apos; calcium fortified beverages may be combined with other food and beverage items, thereby providing such food or beverage items with enhanced calcium levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described in detail below, such detailed description is non-limiting as one skilled in the art would appreciate that Applicants&apos; teachings could be used to produce calcium fortified beverages having a variety of soluble calcium concentrations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> D. Processes of Making Stable Protein-Containing Beverages and Concentrated Calcium Solutions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition to having low soluble calcium concentrations and poor organoleptic properties, it is known that current calcium fortified protein-containing beverages require stabilizers, chelating agents, and special production processes, as when such beverages are calcium fortified and then pasteurized, their proteins are typically destabilized. Unlike prior processes, Applicants&apos; preferred processes for producing protein-containing products allow such products to be formulated without added stabilizers or chelating agents, and then heat treated. As a result, Applicants&apos; process offers significant process advantages as such products (particularly beverages) can be produced using the same process flow and equipment that is used to produce unfortified products. In addition, when stabilizers or chelating agents are introduced, stable products containing significantly higher soluble calcium levels than those of currently disclosed products can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Meta-stable concentrated soluble calcium solutions are important materials used in Applicants&apos; aforementioned processes as the addition of powdered calcium complexes tends to result in settling issues and poor organoleptic properties. Unfortunately, current meta-stable concentrated soluble calcium solutions lack the stability that is required for commercial scale production of calcium fortified protein-containing beverages. However, Applicants have discovered how to produce such a solution. Such process is detailed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Concentrated Soluble Calcium Solutions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It is known that the solubility of materials increases with temperature. Surprisingly, Applicants&apos; have discovered that this principle does not apply to certain meta-stable complexes such as meta-stable calcium complexes. Instead, the solubility and stability of such complexes in solution appear to increase with decreasing their temperature. Based on the aforementioned discovery, Applicants have invented a process that results in highly concentrated solutions of soluble calcium that may be used to calcium-fortify food and beverage products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Applicants&apos; process of making a concentrated soluble calcium solution comprises the steps of making a calcium suspension or solution comprising at least 14,400 ppm, typically from about 14,400 ppm to about 185,000 ppm, of a calcium source while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 24&deg; C.; combining a sufficient amount of said calcium suspension or solution, while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 24&deg; C., and an organic acid blend comprising a first organic acid material and a second organic acid material in a ratio of first organic acid material to second organic acid material of from about 0.2:1 to about 4.8:1, to obtain a concentrated calcium solution having at least 10,000 ppm soluble calcium; and maintaining the resulting concentrated soluble calcium solution&apos;s temperature at about or below 24&deg; C. until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of Applicants&apos; process of making a concentrated soluble calcium solution comprises the steps of making a calcium suspension or solution comprising at least 28,000 ppm, typically from about 28,000 ppm to about 154,000 ppm, of a calcium source while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 16&deg; C.; combining a sufficient amount of said calcium suspension or solution, while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 16&deg; C., and an organic acid blend, comprising a first organic acid material and a second organic acid material in a ratio of first organic acid material to second organic acid material of from about 0.3:1 to about 2.9:1, to obtain a concentrated calcium solution having at least 20,500 ppm soluble calcium; and maintaining the resulting concentrated soluble calcium solution&apos;s temperature at about or below 16&deg; C. until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of Applicants&apos; process of making a concentrated soluble calcium solution comprises the steps of making a calcium suspension or solution comprising at least 43,000 ppm, typically from about 43,000 ppm to about 128,000 ppm, of a calcium source while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 6&deg; C.; combining a sufficient amount of said calcium suspension or solution, while maintaining said suspension or solution&apos;s temperature at or below 6&deg; C., and an organic acid blend, comprising a first organic acid material and a second organic acid material in a ratio of first organic acid material to second organic acid material of from about 0.5:1 to about 1:1, to obtain a concentrated calcium solution having at least 30,800 ppm soluble calcium; and maintaining the resulting concentrated soluble calcium solution&apos;s temperature at about or below 6&deg; C. until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Suitable calcium sources include but are not limited to calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and mixtures thereof. Suitable first organic acid materials include citric acid, hydroxy citric acid and mixtures thereof. Malic acid is a preferred second organic acid material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Applicants&apos; process of making a calcium fortified mammals milk comprises the steps of providing milk, and a concentrated calcium solution comprising at least 10,000 ppm soluble calcium; combining said concentrated calcium solution and milk; adjusting the pH of said combination; and heat treating the resulting fortified milk. A stabilizer and/or chelating agent are generally added if calcium fortified milk comprising at least 1870 ppm soluble calcium, in addition to any soluble calcium inherently present in said milk, is desired. If a stabilizer or chelating agent are added, such materials are typically added to the milk prior to combining said milk and concentrated calcium solution. Typically from 0.002 weight % to about 2.5 weight % stabilizer and from 0.01 weight % to about 0.6 weight % of a chelating agent are added. Generally, sufficient milk and concentrated calcium solution are combined to yield a stabilizer-free calcium fortified milk comprising, in addition to any soluble calcium inherently present in said milk, at least 700 ppm soluble calcium. However, when in possession of the teachings of this specification, one skilled in the art would appreciate that Applicants&apos; method could be used to produce calcium fortified milks having a variety of soluble calcium concentrations. Typically the step of adjusting the pH range of the calcium fortified milk entails adding sufficient amounts of acidic or basic materials to provide a stabilizer-free milk with a pH of from about 6.6 to about 7.3, or a stabilizer containing milk with a pH of from about 6.5 to about 7.3. </paragraph>

A chelating agent is generally added if a calcium fortified milk comprising at least 1670 ppm soluble calcium, in addition to any soluble calcium inherently present in said milk, is desired. If a stabilizer or chelating agent are added, such materials are typically added to the milk prior to combining the starting plant milk and the concentrated calcium solution. Typically when a chelating agent is added, it is added at a level of at least 0.01 weight %. Generally, sufficient plant milk and concentrated calcium solution are combined to yield a stabilizer free calcium fortified milk comprising, in addition to any soluble calcium inherently present in said milk, at least 700 ppm soluble calcium. However, when in possession of the teachings of this specification one skilled in the art would appreciate that Applicants&apos; method could be used to produce calcium fortified milks having a variety of soluble calcium concentrations. Typically the step of adjusting the pH range of the calcium fortified milk entails adding sufficient amounts of acidic or basic materials to provide a chelating agent-free milk or a chelating agent-containing milk with a pH of from about 6.4 to about 8.5. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When determining the overall acceptance rating of a calcium fortified protein-containing product, the product is evaluated by a panel of 15 or more panelists to provide statistically valid results having a confidence interval of at least 95%. The respective unfortified protein-containing beverage is used as a control. The test products are evaluated using blind product paired test. A nine point hedonic scale is used to judge the overall acceptability of the calcium fortified products. Such scale and methodology can be found on pages 101-103 and 213 of Sensory Evaluation Techniques, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition by Morten Meilgaard et al., CRC Press, 1991. </paragraph>
