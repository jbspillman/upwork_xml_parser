<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention has many applications. The present invention may be generally described as a structure for aiding in the following activities: as an epidermal lifting mechanism for providing a lifting force to a predetermined area of the epidermis, such as the area located to either side of the bridge of a person&apos;s nose to provide an increased flow rate of gas through (inhaled and exhaled) the nasal passage, e.g., a nasal dilator; a structure for aiding in keeping an incision open; a structure for aiding in keeping a wound open for cleansing; a structure for aiding in keeping the ends or edges of an incision or wound in close, neat, even, alignment by the application of an even pressure across the wound, burn, or incision, so that the area requiring treatment may heal, or be sutured and closed, neatly and thus develop minimal scar tissue; or as an epidermal positioning mechanism as a device for applying medicine to a wound or other desired place on the epidermis of a human or animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With respect to the invention&apos;s applications as a dressing the invention may be generally described as comprising: a first section, a second section, and a third section. Of these three sections, the first section is coupled to the second section and the second section is coupled to the third section. The second section comprising an elastic material with the first section and the third section each having a first side; and a predetermined portion of the first side including an adhesive located thereon. The second section of the invention may include a plurality of openings of a predetermined size and predetermined shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the predetermined shape or shapes of the openings may be spatially organized in a predetermined manner respective to each other. This is because in one embodiment of the present invention the second section is located between the first and third sections and is preferably composed of an elastic material. By placing openings in the elastic material at predetermined locations the strength of the elastic material, when the elastic material is stretched, may be varied and the distribution of force across the elastic material may by varied. Also, the openings can be used to provide a visual reference to a user of the amount of stress being placed upon the second section and whether or not that section has been stretched sufficiently or been stretched too much since the shape of the openings will change in response to the degree to which the elastic material is stretched. Such a visual reference would be useful to medical personnel where, e.g., it is desirable for a predetermined amount of pressure to be applied to a wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the second section includes a first margin (if the second section is round then there is structurally just one annular margin near at least a portion of the perimeter of the second section) and a second margin. The first section may be integral or coupled to the second section at the first margin; and the third section may be integral or coupled to the second section at the second margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, but not necessarily, the first section and the third section are laminated materials comprising a first layer, a second intermediate layer, and a third layer; with the third layer including the first side coated with adhesive and protected prior to use by a silicone release liner. The second section includes a first margin and a second margin. The first section includes a first channel located between the first layer and the third layer of the first section for receiving the first margin. The second section includes a second channel located between the first layer and the third layer of the second section for receiving the second margin. The second intermediate layer comprising an adhesive material. The first margin and the second margin of the second section respectively including at least one opening and the first margin engaging the second intermediate layer in the first channel and the adhesive material extending through the opening of the first margin; and the second margin engaging the second intermediate layer in the second channel and the adhesive material extending through the opening of the second margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The first and third layer of the first section and the first and third layer of the third section preferably being an inelastic material in some embodiments. The inelastic material may be of any suitable material such as a TYVEC brand type of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the dressing mechanism may be described as comprising: a first section, a second section, and a third section such that the first section is coupled to the second section and the second section is coupled to the third section. The first section and the third section comprising an elastic material and the first section and the third section each having a first side; and a predetermined portion of the first side including an adhesive located thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, the second section includes at least one opening of a predetermined size and the first section and the third section each include at least one opening comprising a predetermined shape. As previously noted the openings of predetermined shape are spatially organized in a predetermined manner respective to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, the second section may include at least one margin and the first section and the third section each have a respective margin area. The first section margin is coupled to the second section at a first predetermined portion the margin of the second section. The third section margin being coupled to the second section at a second predetermined portion of the margin of the second section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the second section is a laminated material comprising at least a first layer, a second intermediate layer, and a third layer; the third layer including the first side. The first section and the third section including a first section margin and a third section margin. Both the first section margin and the third section margin being composed of an elastic material. The second section including at least one channel located between the first layer and the third layer of the second section at the second section margin for receiving the margins of the first and third sections. The second intermediate layer comprising an adhesive material. The first section margin and the third section margin respectively including at least one opening and the margins of the first and third sections engaging the second intermediate layer in the channel at the respective first predetermined margin area and second predetermined margin area so that the adhesive material extends through the openings formed in the material which makes up the first and third section margins. The first and third layer of the second section may, in this embodiment, comprises an inelastic material. The inelastic material may be a polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, the second section includes at least one opening or at least one generally transparent section to either allow the wound or burn to be exposed to the air to be observed visually. Additionally, the second section could be modified to include a mechanism for irrigating the wound or burn under the bandage so that the wound or burn could be cleaned or treated without having to remove the dressing. Also, at least one side of the second section could be designed so that it is capable of isolating the wound in a clean environment by creating a solid antiseptic barrier around the wound through the use of a colloid type adhesive or be capable of contacting a wound or burn so that medicine could be applied to the wound or burn directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With respect the features of the present invention as an epidermal lifting mechanism, the epidermal lifting mechanism may be generally described as comprising at least one strip of material having a first side and a second side, the strip further including a first end portion and a second end portion. Between the first side and the second side are preferably one or more layers of predetermined materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> These layers of materials include without limitation, a silicone coated release liner, an adhesive system to adhere the epidermal lifting mechanism to the nose, a top layer of material, and a spring mechanism. Obviously, the release liner is removed prior to placing the epidermal lifting mechanism on the bridge of the nose. The adhesive system, just like the adhesive system for the dressing mechanism, can include a pressure sensitive hypoallergenic acrylic or a hydrocolloid material but any suitable adhesive system may be used. The top layer of material can be either a non-woven material or a material with some stretch characteristics such as a three mil polyurethane film. The spring mechanism may comprise a polyester film (usually 2 mils to 8 mils in thickness but any suitable thickness range may be used, e.g., 1-15 mils would be suitable as an alternative thickness range but any thickness range can be used depending upon the desired use and durability) laminated to a spun bonded polyester material. The spun bonded polyester material may or may not be coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive. The spring mechanism may be a plurality of materials which are laminated together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although unitary, the mechanism has the following components: a pair of nose pods and a bridge section. The nose pods include an exposed adhesive surface which is bonded to the skin on the sides of the nose. The bridge section of the device has at least one fulcrum point, located at the bridge of the nose when it is applied to the bridge of a nose, and lies across the bridge of the nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, it should also be noted that the present invention could be applied to simply one side of the nose with the bridge section of the device ending at the top of the bridge of the nose and being adhered thereto. Alternatively, the bridge section could simply be a strip of resilient or elastic material which is connected to the cheek of the wearer at one end by use of an adhesive material and the nose pod being connected to the side of the nasal passage at the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it is preferable for the nose pods to include horseshoe shaped slits or cuts which are made in the top layer of the material through the adhesive layer which, when applied to the nose, allows the spring action to generate a uniform lifting force in a suction cup like manner while at the same time applying a shearing force to the adhesive itself due to the presence of the slit structures, rather than a lifting force thereby creating flexibility from the lift point to the adhesion point. By decreasing the lifting (peel) force on the adhesive, the stability of the bond between the adhesive and the skin is greatly increased and allows more flexibility of the dilator during facial movement. Thus the dilator will stay comfortably in place even during vigorous movement by the wearer; even when used in applications other than a nasal dilator. The lifting (peel) force on the adhesive may be further decreased by use of a coextensive, overlaying barrier layer comprised of a non-adhesive material. The non-adhesive, overlaying barrier layer is preferably located between a portion of the adhesive material and the pod material such that an area of non-adhesiveness is created between the adhesive layer and the pod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A pair of flaps attached adjacent to the bridge section of the epidermal lifting mechanism create another pair of fulcrum points (fulcrum point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) between the bridge of the nose (fulcrum point <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the adhesive material thereby increasing the dilation force of the outer epidermis of the nasal passages. The additional fulcrum points are accomplished by folding of the flaps adjacent to the bridge section underneath the epidermal lifting mechanism allowing the adhesive area of each flap to adhere to the bottom adhesive area of the bridge section of the epidermal lifting mechanism securing it in place. The flaps include perforations for ease of folding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the pair of flaps creates an additional fulcrum point. Further, when folded they provide a cushioned area for the bridge of the nose to cover the adhesive on the underside of the epidermal lifting mechanism so when applied for several hours and then removed discomfort to the skin tissue on the bridge of the nose is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the top and bottom spring laminates are laminated together and the epidermal lifting mechanism is applied to the nose, the bending of the multi-level springing increases the opening force to the nasal passages over a single level spring. Adding a layer of spring material on top of another layer of spring material creates a leaf spring action. Because there is a stretching force introduced into the top layer when bent over a fulcrum point, a stronger spring action is created as compared to a single layer spring of equal of thickness. Furthermore, bending over a fulcrum point or at multiple fulcrum points further improves the spring action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Additionally, various pod configurations may be used to allow for flexibility of the bottom spring and/or to allow the pods to conform to the irregular surfaces of the nose or epidermal layer to which they are applied. Further, a fulcrum point may be provided by use of two, spaced apart pad structures having elastic material there between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A key advantage of this mechanism is that anytime a person engages in physical activity that increases his or her heart rate, this mechanism allows for the delivery of more oxygen to the lungs. Further, the mechanism allows for more air to be effectively exhaled and thus both inhalation and exhalation are enhanced so overall breathing efficiency is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, this invention may be described as a method for increasing the flow rate of gas through the nasal passages, the method comprising the steps of applying the epidermal lifting mechanism by bending the spring material over the bridge of the nose so that the adhesive material of the nose pods comes into positive contact with the sides of the nose and releasing the nose pods thus allowing the springs to mechanically lift the epidermal surface of the nose and increase the size of the nasal passage openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the present invention may be structure which may be used as a nasal dilator wherein the nasal dilator comprises two separate pieces each capable of acting independently of the other. Each piece having at least one nose pod and an elastic member or strip attached to that nose pod. The elastic member or strip having a first end and a second end with the nose pods being attached to the first end. The elastic member having a second end attached to an anchor mechanism. The anchor mechanism having a first side and an adhesive material included thereon. The nose pod having the previously described structure for a nose pod. The anchor mechanism being applied to a predetermined area on a persons cheek a sufficient distance away from the side of the persons nose so that the nose pod, coupled to the elastic member, may be applied to the outside surface or epidermis surrounding the nasal passage of a persons nose and the elastic member retracting between the anchor mechanism and the nose pod causing lifting of the epidermis on the side of the nose and thereby increasing the opening of the nasal passage way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention may be considered an epidermal positioning mechanism having an elastic material coupled to a first end piece and a second piece. The first and second end pieces each having at least one side including an adhesive material. Preferably, but not necessarily, depending upon the application of the present invention, at least one of the end pieces would be the anchoring structure or mechanism while the other end piece acts as a lifting end piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Additionally the present invention need not solely be used as a nasal dilator but, as previously noted, may also be used as an epidermal positioning system for treatments of wounds and incisions by either keeping the wound or incision open for the purpose of medical treatment such as surgical procedures or cleansing of the wound or incision or by positioning the ends of the wound together in close proximity to aid in suturing of a wound or simply to be used as a suture mechanism in and of itself to hold the ends of a wound together or to hold the ends of an incision together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, when the device of the present invention is used over a wound it may also have application as a bandage. For example, the elastic or resilient material will have at least one side positioned over and adjacent the wound or incision area. This side positioned over or adjacent the wound or incision area may have a medicinal material applied thereto. This medicinal material may be, for example, zinc chromate or an alginate like calcium or sodium alginate; each of those materials respectively having anti-bacterial and clot enhancing capabilities. Other medicinal materials or even non-medicinal materials could also be applied using the device of the present invention depending upon the goals and results desired of the particular user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the epidermal positioning mechanism of the present invention is used as a bandage it should be noted that a bandage structure could be combined with the present invention such that the bandage structure would have at least a first end and second end and elastic material would be coupled to the first end and to the second end with an anchoring structure coupled to a portion of the elastic material as well. This would provide at least two anchor points at the ends of the resilient elastic material not coupled to the bandage structure. In this manner one of the anchor structures could be adhered to the skin at a predetermined position and the bandage structure positioned over the wound or incision by stretching the resilient or elastic material and then applying the other anchor structure could be to the skin at another predetermined position. In this manner, the elastic material will contract and this will have the effect of forcing the bandage material into more positive contact with the wound and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the bandaged material. If desired a medicinal compound could be applied to the surface of the bandage material which is adjacent to the surface of the wound or incision. Additionally, the bandage material may be comprised of a hydrophilic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The anchoring structure in such a use would of course comprise at least two end pieces coupled to the elastic material at predetermined positions and the end pieces would include an adhesive material attached to a side of the anchoring end pieces adjacent to the epidermis or skin to which they are to be attached. The bandage structure could also have a medicinal material applied to it as previously noted with respect to the elastic material. The adhesive material may extend as an adhesive layer coextensive a side of the anchoring end pieces, or alternatively, may extend over a predetermined portion of a side of an anchoring end piece. As discussed with regard to a previous embodiment, a coextensive, overlaying barrier layer composed of a non-adhesive material may be provided. The non-adhesive overlaying barrier layer is preferably located between a portion of the adhesive material and end piece material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the mechanism of the present invention could be described as epidermal lifting mechanism having anchor/lifting portions, connected via an elastic or stretchable material, and include an adhesive surface. The anchor/lifting portions being such that each portion, depending upon where it is applied, may act as either an anchor portion or a lifting portion. The anchor/lifting portions having a plurality of incisions or cuts of predetermined shape which divide each anchor/lifting portion into a plurality of adhesive areas. This division of the anchor/lifting portion into a plurality of adhesive areas allows the anchor/lifting portion adhesive areas to be divided such that after a first anchor/lifting portion is applied to the desired epidermal location a first predetermined portion of that first anchor/lifting mechanism may be peeled away and leave a second predetermined portion, having a predetermined shape due to the plurality of cuts or incisions, in place on the epidermal location. Subsequently, a second anchor/lifting portion, connected to the first anchor/lifting portion via the elastic material, may be applied to a second predetermined or desired epidermal location so that the elastic material is stretched a desired amount. The second anchor/lifting portion, if it is substantially similar to the first anchor/lifting portion may be applied to the epidermis so that it may be peeled away and leave a second predetermined portion, having a predetermined shape due to the plurality of cuts or incisions, in place on the epidermal location. Accordingly, the first and second anchor/lifting portions may act as a separate anchor point and lifting point or as separate anchor points or as separate lifting points and the elastic material may simply be used to supply tension between the points or it may be used to apply a material such as a medicine to the epidermis located between the two points or it may be used to supply tension and apply a material between the two points, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that it is within the scope of this invention to provide hook and loop type fastening means for the devices described. The hook and loop type fastener means may be used in combination with adhesive or as the sole means of applying a device to a limb, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention may be described as a method for using a dressing mechanism where the dressing mechanism comprises a first section, a second section, and a third section; the first section being coupled to the second section and the second section being coupled to the third section; the first section and the third section comprising an elastic material; the first section and the third section each having a first side; and a predetermined portion of the first side including an adhesive located thereon. The method consequently comprising: First, applying the first section to a first predetermined location on an epidermis. Second, pulling the third section toward a second predetermined location on the epidermis. Third, applying the third section to the second predetermined location on the epidermis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the method could be described as a method for using a dressing comprising a plurality of anchor structures, a treatment section, and an elastic material. The elastic material extending from the anchoring structure to the treatment section. The elastic material being coupled to at least one anchoring structure at a first coupling section and to the treatment section at a second coupling section. The method comprising the steps of positioning the treatment section over a first predetermined area of an epidermis; applying at least one anchor structure to a second predetermined area of the epidermis; and applying at one other anchor structure to a third predetermined area of the epidermis.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structure. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises an epidermal lifting mechanism for providing a lifting force to a predetermined epidermal area, such as the bridge of the nose, to provide an increased flow rate of gas through the nasal passage and will be referred to generally as <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the following detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A, a prior art device is shown. The prior art device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is currently marketed by CNS, Inc. of Chanhassen, Minn. and sold under the trademark BREATHE RIGHT. The same device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, however the device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> includes the flaps of the present invention whose structure and advantages are discussed in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The present invention, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, includes a two part multi-level leaf spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The two part multi-level leaf spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of spring laminates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each spring laminate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is manufactured from a 2 mil to 8 mil polyester film laminated to a spun bonded polyester material. The spun bonded polyester material may or may not be coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive. The spring laminates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are laminated together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the top <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> spring laminates are laminated together and the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied to the bridge of the nose, represented by the fulcrum point <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the bending of the multi-level spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases the opening force to the nasal passages over a single level spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Adding a layer of spring material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on top of another layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of spring material creates a leaf spring action. Because there is a stretching force introduced into the top layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when bent over a fulcrum point, a stronger (compound) spring action is created as compared to a single layer spring of equal thickness. Furthermore, bending over a fulcrum point creates a stronger yet spring action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 18</cross-reference>, the material layers of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include a silicone coated release liner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an adhesive system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to adhere the epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the nose, a top layer of material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the two part spring laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The top layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is composed of two layers of material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B and contains the springs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> there between, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The release liner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removed prior to placing the mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the bridge of the nose. The adhesive system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can either be a pressure sensitive hypo-allergenic acrylic or a hydrocolloid system. The top layer of material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be either a non-woven material or a material with some stretch characteristics such as a 3 mil polyurethane film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Although unitary in construction, it has the following components: a pair of pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> include an exposed adhesive surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is bonded to the skin on the sides of the nose. The pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> configurations allow for flexibility of the bottom spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to conform to the irregular surfaces of the nose. The bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the device has at least one fulcrum point as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and lies across the bridge of the nose as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> include horseshoe shaped cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the top layer of material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which, when applied to the nose, allows the spring action to generate a uniform lifting force in a suction cuplike manner while at the same time applies a shearing force to the adhesive itself rather than a peeling force thereby creating flexibility from the lift point to the adhesion point. This principle is demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. By decreasing the peel force <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on the adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> the bond between the adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the skin is greatly increased and allows more flexibility of the epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during facial movement. The shearing forces are shown at <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be further improved by including a pair of flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which are attached adjacent to the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, when folded underneath or over the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, create another pair of fulcrum points along lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> between the bridge of the nose (fulcrum point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied to the wearer&apos;s nose. Thus, the flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, when folded, function to increase the dilation force to the outer epidermis of the nasal passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the additional fulcrum points <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are accomplished by folding the flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> underneath the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> thereby allowing the adhesive area of each flap <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to adhere to the bottom of the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> thus securing it in place. The flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> further include perforations <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for ease of folding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the pair of flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> adds fulcrum points. Accordingly, when the flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are folded they form end sections along lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which will be located to either side of the bridge of the nose. Each of the end sections along lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will act as a fulcrum point in addition to the bridge of the nose thereby increasing the number of fulcrum points and the mechanical lifting ability of the present invention. Further, when folded they provide a cushioned area for the bridge of the nose and cover the adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the underside of the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so when applied for several hours and then removed, discomfort to the skin tissue on the bridge of the nose is greatly reduced or eliminated since no adhesive has been in contact with the bridge of the nose due to the barrier created by the flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The material layers of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Again, the layers include a silicone coated release liner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an adhesive system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to adhere the epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the nose, a first spring laminate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a second spring laminate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a top layer of material <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 14</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the shape of the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown to be rectangular instead of round. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the horseshoe shaped cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> have been removed and additional slits <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A have been added. In this embodiment, when the flaps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are not folded over, slits <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A mechanically adjust the peeling action to a shear action thereby allowing greater adhesion over the predetermined epidermal area. Additionally, in this embodiment a cut could be made along line <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to divide the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> whereby section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> could be discarded and section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> could be used as a dilator for only one side of a person&apos;s nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> includes slits <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and further includes a two-part pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises an upper pod half <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a Lower pod half <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Pod halves <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and slits <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> allow for greater flexibility of the pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the nose of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> with the exception that the bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has been widened. The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> includes the wider bridge section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in combination with rectangular pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Additional slits <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> have also been added near the outer sides of the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Slits <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> change the direction of the force applied to the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that instead of a peel force (a force which tends to peel away the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the epidermis to which they are applied) to a sheer forces (a force which tends to drag the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> across the epidermis to which they are applied). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> demonstrates the principal that different pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> configurations can be used on the same epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown on the left side has a sloping side to allow for better adhesion to the side of the nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The application of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the nose of the wearer is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 17</cross-reference>. Preferred installation of the epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the bridge of the nose is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> while in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the epidermal lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied too high on the nose and is applied too low in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. However, while the positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> are not preferred they are functional since the structure of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows a user the ability to apply the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over a relatively large epidermal area and thus effectiveness of the present invention is greatly enhanced. The present invention will generally work effectively in all the positions shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, this invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be described as a method for increasing the flow rate of gas through the nasal passages, the method comprising the steps of removing the release liner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and positioning the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> or as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, depending upon the comfort of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19, a</cross-reference> top plan view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be seen to comprise an elastic midsection <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having ends <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Ends <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are coupled to pod sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This embodiment does not include any spring mechanism other than the elastic section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; the elastic section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> taking the place of the spring mechanism. The resiliency of the elastic section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will cause the two nasal pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be drawn together when the elastic member contracts. If this is done over a fulcrum point such as the bridge of the nose it will cause a lifting of the nasal passages and thus may be used as a nasal dilator as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Additionally the mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> may be used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> to aid in holding a wound or incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> closed either for the purposes of healing as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> or for the purpose of aiding in suturing as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. The pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> adhering to the epidermis to either side of the wound and the elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> being stretched across the wound so that it will contract and draw the two pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> towards each other thereby closing the wound in an effective manner. Additionally, when the wound is closed in this manner a surgeon or physician may have both hands free to apply sutures <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> along the wound or incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This is believed particularly helpful when dealing with a large wound or incision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> With respect to the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> it should be noted that U shaped cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are also illustrated. Again, these cuts or incisions may be of any shape although the U, or horseshoe shape is preferred, however the embodiment disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> could function with these U, or horseshoe shaped cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The anchor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has an adhesive layer applied to it in the same manner as the adhesive layer which is applied to the pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The embodiment of the invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> has application for maintaining an incision opening or wound opening for either a surgical procedure or cleansing purposes as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> or for use as a nasal dilator for application to only side of a person&apos;s nose as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be seen applied to the side of a persons nose <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is stretched so that anchor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be applied to the side of persons face <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A. Thus, elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will contract and pull pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and anchor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> toward one another but since anchor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned on a substantially stationary epidermal area of the person&apos;s face the majority of the movement will occur at pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> causing the epidermal area to which it is applied to be pulled outward and thus open the nasal passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be seen to be held open by the action of the embodiment disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The anchors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are applied to a substantially stationary epidermal area and the elastic members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are stretched and the pods <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are positioned to either side of the wound or incision to hold it open so that the wound may be cleansed or a surgical procedure may be performed through the incision thus freeing the physician&apos;s hands for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the U shaped cuts <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are disclosed in the embodiment of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. While these U shaped cuts are preferred they are not considered necessary to practice the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28, 29</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows the nose <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the nasal passages <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> in cross sectional view. The nasal passages in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> being shown open but absent the use of any nasal dilator. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> the same cross sectional view is shown but the nose <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and in particular the nasal passages <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are shown being in a state of relatively little airflow through the nasal passages <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates a cross sectional view using a nasal dilator of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein the nasal passages <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the nose <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are held substantially open for airflow through the nasal passages <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Clearly, the alternative embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</cross-reference> could also be practiced according to the methods previously disclosed. Specifically, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> could be practiced as a method using the structure previously described wherein the embodiment disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is applied by first applying one nose pod section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to ore side of a wound <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and stretching the elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> over the wound <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and then applying the nose pod section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the other side or opposite side of the wound or incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> whereby the wound or incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is held closed. Additionally, it should be noted that a medicinal material could be applied to the elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> over the portion of its surface which would be adjacent to the wound or incision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and thus aid in healing of the wound. Medicinal materials such as zinc chromate or calcium alginate or sodium alginate are possible such compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> could be used in a method wherein the pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is applied to an epidermal area which is desired to be pulled or raised. This epidermal area could be an area immediately adjacent an incision or wound <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or the side epidermis of a person&apos;s nose <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> being stretched and the anchor portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being applied with its adhesive side to an epidermal area which is relatively stationary and the elastic material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> contracting and thereby raising or pulling or lifting the skin to which the pod <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been attached to via its adhesive side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31, 32</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the mechanism of the present invention could be described as epidermal lifting mechanism having anchor/lifting portions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, connected via an elastic or stretchable material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and include an adhesive surface <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The anchor/lifting portions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being such that each portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, depending upon where it is applied, may act as either an anchor portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or a lifting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The anchor/lifting portions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having a plurality of incisions or cuts <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of predetermined shape, (e.g., U shaped as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) which divide each anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> into a plurality of adhesive areas <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This division of the anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> into a plurality of adhesive areas <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> allows the anchor/lifting portion adhesive areas <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to be divided such that after a first anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is applied to the desired epidermal location a first predetermined portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of that first anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be peeled away and leave a second predetermined portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>having a predetermined shape due to the plurality of cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, in place on the epidermal location. Subsequently, a second anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, connected to the first anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> via the elastic material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, may be applied to a second predetermined or desired epidermal location so that the elastic material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is stretched a desired amount. The second anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, if it is substantially similar to the first anchor/lifting portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may be applied to the epidermis so that it may be peeled away and leave a second predetermined portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>having a predetermined shape due to the plurality of cuts or incisions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, in place on the epidermal location. Accordingly, the first and second anchor/lifting portions <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may act as a separate anchor point and lifting point or as separate anchor points or as separate lifting points and the elastic material <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may simply be used to supply tension between the points <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or it may be used to apply a material such as a medicine to the epidermis located between the two points or it may be used to supply tension and apply a material between the two points, etc. The purpose of this alternative embodiment to take advantage of the multiple shear points <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> created using this design to enhance the adhesion of this embodiment to the desired epidermal location so that the anchor/lifting portions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> maintain proper adhesion at their desired locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</cross-reference> another alternative embodiment of the present invention may be observed. The dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is comprised of a multiple layer or laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at its anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and a latex rubber <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> at its center section <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. The laminated material includes a top surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> made of TYVEC brand material and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> also made of the same material but coated with a hypo-allergenic acrylic adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> and covered with a silicone release liner. The anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> have an adhesive bottom layer <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> for adhering to an epidermis <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has a channel or slit: <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> into which margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> of the latex rubber <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> are engaged. The margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> include openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the channel <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> includes the adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> which extends through the openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from the bottom <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to the top <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. This creates a series of adhesive openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> which act as plugs which extend through the openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and couple the upper layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to the lower layer <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> effectively holding the non-elastic TYVEC material together so that the latex material <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is effectively locked into the channel <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and cannot easily be removed by tension when stretched. Accordingly, margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> are secured to the anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> at locking section <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> the center section <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may be observed to include a TYVEC brand material stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> which is bonded to a gauze pad <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> via openings <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, in the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> which contain adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. The adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> extending in a plug like manner from the pad <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to the stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. This creates a bandage or dressing structure which is suspended by the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> between the anchoring sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Further, as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51 and 52</cross-reference> the shape of the TYVEC top layer <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> need not be rectangular but can be of any design, e.g., round. When this embodiment is applied over a wound or other predetermined area of the epidermis <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the latex material <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is stretched between the two anchoring sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> which causes the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to act much like a leaf spring and apply a positive pressure downward through the pad <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the wound to which this device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is applied will have a positive pressure against it. It is well known in first aid that pressure applied to a wound will help reduce bleeding. The present invention thus provides an effective bandage which will also effectively limit bleeding from the wound. Further, the positive down pressure will effectively maintain contact of the pad <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> with the wound or other predetermined area despite movement of the surrounding epidermis <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</cross-reference> it should be noted that stability strips <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are included to illustrate that it is presently believed that in commercial utilization of the present invention that it is believed to be desirable to provide material to keep the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> relatively rigid prior to use. The strips <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are removed prior to use by tearing the material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> along the perforations <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The strips <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are separated from the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> by gap <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Also, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is curve <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> which is believed to provide strain relief when the present dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is applied so that even pressure is exerted across the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</cross-reference>, should also be noted. The openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are located in a tension adjustment section <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the number of openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> or whether they are present at all the tension applied to the latex section <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Further, as the tension adjustment section <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is stretched to apply the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> the openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> will become distorted. The greater the stretching the greater the tension applied to the latex section <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Consequently, a person applying the dressing structure disclosed herein may visually see the amount of tension applied to the latex section <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. This allows a person applying a dressing <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or series of dressings <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to apply the dressings <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in a manner so that the pressure and exerted by the stretching of the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is kept relatively constant. Alternatively, it allows the user to apply dressings <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which will apply a variety of pressures across the desired treatment area. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 and 86</cross-reference> another alternative design of the present invention may be observed. In this embodiment the center section is a breathable membrane <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of a type commonly used for dressing applications. Perforations <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> allow the dressing to be broken apart to form a plurality of anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> are provided in the member <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> to prevent tearing of the membrane <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. A locking section <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, previously described, is provided. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78 and 79</cross-reference> the cross-sectional construction may be seen to include at top layer of material <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, a layer of adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> including openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, material <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, adhesive <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, the breathable membrane <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, and a colloid adhesive <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>. The dressing <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> capable of covering a desired area of an epidermis <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and substantially isolating that area from external contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83, 84</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> the same structures as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 and 86</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are shown with the exception that the breathable membrane <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> has been eliminated so that there is only an opening <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. This dressing <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is believed to have application where it is desired that the wounded or burnt area of the epidermis be exposed to air. Since the spring action of the latex <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> will press down on the epidermal area surround the wound or burn within the opening <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> this is believed to cause the wound or burn to well up and thus receive maximum exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</cross-reference> another alternative embodiment similar to the structure disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</cross-reference> with the exception that the breathable membrane <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> has been replaced with an sealed membrane <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight> such as a urethane commonly used to hold IV type fluids. Extending through this membrane <highlight><bold>399</bold></highlight> is an input port and an output port. This dressing <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> could be used to seal a wound from external contamination but allow the wound to be irrigated or medicine applied or tissue samples taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87 and 88</cross-reference> another embodiment is illustrated showing a resealable closure <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The closure or zipper <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may bisect the dressing or extend only partially across the dressing <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The closure <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is provided to allow access to the wound or burn or other area without having to remove and reapply the bandage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> various applications of the dressings <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> described herein may be seen to be illustrated in use on a human being. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> another embodiment, similar to the structure disclosed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is shown. As seen, the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is comprised of a multiple layer or laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and a multiple layer or laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at its center section <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. As may be seen particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</cross-reference>, the laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes a top surface or layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> made of TYVEC brand material or spun silk, and a bottom surface or layer <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> comprised of a hypo-allergenic adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, covered with a silicone release liner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> preferably further includes a channel <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> into which margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> of an elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> are engaged, thereby locating the margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> between the top surface layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> may be formed of latex rubber or other suitably elastic material. The margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> preferably includes openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> which allow the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> to extend through the openings <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to communicate with the top surface layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, thereby coupling the top surface layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to the margins <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. This action effectively locks the elastic material <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> into position so that it may not be easily removed by tension when stretched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Still referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the center section <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may be observed to include a stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. The stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> may be fabricated of TYVC brand material, spun silk, or any other suitable material. The stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, is preferably bonded to the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> via openings <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, in elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> which allow an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to communicate through the openings <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> with section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. This action couples the stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> whereby the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is suspended by the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> between the anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The stabilizing section <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> may be further provided with openings <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> which allow easy dispersal of medicaments or other substances (not shown) through the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to an epidermis (not shown in these views). It is further to be noted that the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be formed of a hydrophilic material (as shown), gauze, or any other suitable material. Furthermore, it may be noted that a silicone surface material <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may be applied to any pad member surface, to aid in shear reduction on the epidermal surface to which the device is affixed. Alternatively, the pad member may be entirely replaced by a silicone surface material (not shown). Additionally, previously described embodiments may also include a hydrophilic material as part of the pad or center section construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> The dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> may be further observed to include a barrier layer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably overlays at least a portion of the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, between the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> and the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. As is seen particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</cross-reference>, the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> may preferably include a distal end <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably overlays a portion at the proximal end <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> reduces the lifting or peel force on the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> thereby increasing the stability of the bond between the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> and an epidermis (not shown) when the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is applied and the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is stretched between the anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in previous embodiments, when this embodiment is applied over a wound or other predetermined area, the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> acts much as a leaf spring and applies a positive pressure downward through the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The additional use of a hydrophilic pad material as shown in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> works in combination with the positive pressure downward pressure to effectively maintain contact of the pad member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the predetermined area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be located in a tension adjustment section <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. As mentioned previously with regard to other embodiments, as the tension adjustment section <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is stretched to apply the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> will become distorted. The greater the stretching, the greater the tension applied to the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. In this way the amount of tension applied to the elastic member <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> may be seen, allowing a person applying the dressing to keep the pressure relatively constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> another embodiment of the present invention may be seen. Similarly to the embodiment seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the dressing structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>seen in these views is composed of a multiple layer or laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at anchor sections <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a multiple layer or laminated material <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at its center section <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. However, as seen particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference>, anchor section <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a plurality of loop members <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>.
