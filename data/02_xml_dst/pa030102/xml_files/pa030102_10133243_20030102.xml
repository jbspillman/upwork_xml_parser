<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a tool holder for use in machine tools, comprising a main body, which rotates about an axis of rotation, and cutter holders which each hold a cutting plate and can be radially adjusted by means of an axially displaceable control rod and coupling means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tool holders of this kind are used for turning work, in particular for producing an inner recess, hereinafter called a turned groove. In this connection, tool holders are known which have an axially displaceable control rod which can be driven in an axial movement by means of a machine-side hydraulic or electric servo drive. The axial movement is converted by suitable coupling means, for example via a wedge mechanism that can be actuated by the control rod, into a radial movement of a single cutter holder on which a cutting plate is disposed which comes into engagement with the workpiece to be machined. A tool holder of this kind is known from DE 40 22 579 A1, for example. The latter is for single-cutter machining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, tool holders are already known in which, for the purpose of producing a turned groove, a plurality of cutters are disposed about the circumference of a rotating mount which for its part revolves on a circular trajectory. In this kind of circular milling work, individual cutters successively engage the workpiece which is to be machined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,624 discloses a tool holder in which two cutter holders are simultaneously provided which are disposed at an axial distance from one another and can be adjusted in the axial direction by means of an eccentrically mounted and axially displaceable control rod with an oblique toothing. A cutting tool can be fixed on each of the cutter holders, so that two turned grooves axially spaced apart from each other can be made simultaneously in a workpiece. For each turned groove, only one cutting tool comes into engagement with the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Tool holders for single-cutter machining and tool holders with a plurality of cutters for circular machining have the disadvantage that the surface quality obtained with them in the turned groove, and the geometric roundness of the latter, is in many cases unsatisfactory, with the result that re-machining may be necessary. In addition, the turned groove requires a considerable production time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to form a tool holder of the type mentioned at the outset in such a way that it is possible, within a very short time, to produce a turned groove which satisfies stringent demands regarding surface quality and geometric roundness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, this object is achieved, in a tool holder of the generic type, by the fact that the tool holder has at least two cutter holders which can be radially adjusted between a retracted position and an extended position and whose cutters can be simultaneously brought into engagement with a workpiece in order to produce a turned groove. Using a plurality of cutter holders whose cutters simultaneously engage with the workpiece during machining provides for mutual supporting of the cutters. This results in a higher degree of precision and, consequently, a particularly high surface quality of the turned groove which is produced. Moreover, it is thereby possible to meet very stringent demands in respect of the geometric roundness of the turned groove. In addition, the simultaneous use of a plurality of cutters permits a considerable reduction in the time needed to produce the turned groove. This provides considerable cost advantages for the user, which in turn leads to savings on production units and represents a significant potential for rationalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The tool holder preferably comprises three cutter holders disposed about a circumference of a circle and each with an associated cutter. The use of three cutters effects particularly reliable mutual support, and by this means the radial feed can also be increased by a factor of 3 compared to machining of the workpiece with only one cutter, as a result of which, once again, the time needed to produce the turned groove can be correspondingly reduced. In this connection, provision can be made for the tool holders to be disposed uniformly about the circumference. A non-uniform distribution can be particularly advantageous since the non-uniform introduction of force which can thereby be obtained results in strong damping of vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The radial movement of the cutter holders is produced by the control rod, the movement of which is transmitted to the cutter holders via suitable coupling means. A hydraulic or electric servo drive can be used on the machine side for driving the control rod. However, it is particularly advantageous if the drive of the control rod is effected mechanically. For this purpose, provision can be made for the tool holder to comprise gear means for converting a rotation movement of the main body into an axially oriented reciprocating movement of the control rod. In such an embodiment, the main body has a dual function. On the one hand, the rotation movement guarantees a corresponding rotary movement of the cutters, and, on the other hand, the rotation movement of the main body serves as a drive for the control rod, which in turn produces the radial movement of the cutter holders. Such a configuration has the advantage that on the machine side only a drive spindle has to be provided to which the main body can be coupled in order to obtain a rotation movement, and so a hydraulic or electric servo drive on the machine side can be dispensed with. In this case, the tool holder has a purely mechanical drive system and can therefore be of particularly robust construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to easily adapt the working stroke of the cutter holders, between their retracted position and their extended position, to the specific conditions of use, it is advantageous if the axial stroke of the control rod is adjustable. For this purpose, depending on the axial stroke which is desired, different gear means can be used for converting the rotation movement of the main body into the axial movement of the control rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the gear means comprise two cam elements which can rotate relative to one another and bear on one another via a control cam which is oriented obliquely with respect to the axial direction. The cam elements can be of annular construction, for example, and can enclose the main body about its circumference, it being ensured that they have a different speed of rotation relative to one another. At least one cam element forms a control cam on which the other cam element bears, and, as a result of the oblique orientation of the control cam, an axial movement is produced by the relative turning of the cam elements which bear on one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this connection, it is advantageous if a first cam element is coupled to the main body via a toothed gearing. In this way, the rotation movement of the main body is transmitted to the first cam element via the toothed gearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The toothed gearing can be constructed in the manner of a planetary gear, for example, and can have two planetary wheels disposed on a common axis of rotation, connected rigidly to one another and each meshing with a toothed ring, the toothed rings preferably being oriented coaxially with respect to the axis of rotation of the main body and each surrounding said main body. In this connection, a first toothed ring can be mounted nonrotatably on the main body and thus executes a common rotation movement with the latter, while the second toothed ring has a different speed of rotation in relation to the main body. The first cam element is preferably mounted directly and in a rotationally fixed manner on the second toothed ring. By selecting the desired transmission ratios, on the one hand between the toothed rings and the planetary wheels, and, on the other hand, between the two planetary wheels, the speed of rotation of the second toothed ring and of the first cam element can thus be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A rotation movement of the second cam element can be obtained by the fact that it is connected rigidly to the control rod, which control rod is mounted on the main body in such a way as to be axially displaceable but not rotatable. Because of the nonrotatable mount, the control rod has the same speed of rotation as the main body, with the result that the second cam element connected rigidly to the control rod also has the identical speed of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The reciprocating movement of the control rod is produced by means of the control cam. In this connection, it is of advantage if the return movement of the control rod is spring-assisted. Thus, for example, provision can be made for one of the two cam elements, for example the second cam element, to be spring-loaded in the direction of the other cam element. By this means it is possible to ensure that the two cam elements bear securely on one another even at very high speeds of rotation. The spring-loading can be produced, for example, by means of a compression spring, which bears on the control rod, and is transmitted from this to the second cam element connected to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The coupling means disposed between the control rod and the cutting plates have not yet been explained. In a preferred embodiment of the tool holder according to the invention, the cutter holders are mounted displaceably in radially oriented guides and each bear on a slide surface, of the control rod, oriented obliquely with respect to the axis of rotation. It is thus ensured, in a particularly simple way in terms of construction, that the cutter holders are displaced radially from their retracted position to their extended position when the control rod is moved axially forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure a forced return of the cutter holders from their extended position to their retracted position upon a reverse axial movement of the control rod, an elastic return element is preferably provided. A particularly preferred embodiment in this connection is characterized in that the cutter holders comprise a carriage which is displaceable between the retracted position and the extended position and on which the cutter is mounted, and a return spring loading the carriage in the direction of its retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure that the cutter holders do not execute any uncontrolled, radially outwardly directed movement as a result of the centrifugal forces induced by rotation, the cutter holders, in a particularly preferred embodiment, are mounted displaceably on the control rod and can be positively connected thereto. The positive connection ensures that the cutter holders bear securely on the control rod even at high speeds of rotation. An uncontrolled movement is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The positive connection can be configured, for example, as a dovetail guide. In a structurally particularly simple embodiment of the positive connection between cutter holder and control rod, a guide slot is provided on one of the parts to be connected, and a tension bolt of complementary configuration fixed on the other part engages in the guide slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if the tool holder comprises an adjustment mechanism for adjusting the setting of the cutter holders in their retracted position. In this way, the cutters mounted on the cutter holders and used for producing a turned groove can easily be adapted to the particular internal diameter of the workpiece bore which is to be provided with the turned groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In order to adjust or fine-tune the setting of the cutter holders, provision is preferably made for the length of the control rod to be able to be altered. The longer the control rod, the more the cutter holders bearing obliquely on it protrude radially outward. If the setting of the cutter holders is to be adapted, for example, to a smaller diameter of the workpiece bore, all that has to be done is to reduce the length of the control rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, it is advantageous if the control rod has separate front and rear rod portions which can be connected to one another with adjustable axial spacing via an adjustment element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The tool holder according to the invention comprises a plurality of cutter holders which each have a cutter and which, via mechanical transmission means, are driven in a radially oriented movement by the rotating main body, executing a radial movement from their retracted position to their extended position and back again to the retracted position. All the cutters come simultaneously into engagement with the workpiece and in so doing mutually support each other. To obtain a turned groove, all that has to be done is to drive the main body in a rotation movement so that the cutter holders extend outward for radial grooving and then resume their retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the tool holder comprises a sensor unit for detecting the retracted position of the cutter holders. By means of the sensor unit it is possible to generate a stop signal for the machine-side drive of the main body, so that the machine-side drive of the main body can be switched off when the cutter holders have resumed their retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous if the retracted position and also the extended position of the cutter holders can be detected by means of the sensor unit. This permits particularly reliable monitoring of the grooving procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The retracted position and advantageously also the extended position can preferably be detected in a contactless manner. In this way, mechanical wear of the sensor unit can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the sensor unit has at least one Hall sensor, with which at least one corresponding magnet is associated. The retracted position of the cutter holders can thus be determined, for example, by means of a magnet being disposed on each of the cutter holders and having in each case a corresponding Hall sensor. Provision can also be made for contactless detection of the position of the control rod which corresponds to the position of the cutter holders since, because of the positive guidance of the cutter holders, there is an unambiguous relationship between the position of the control rod and the position of the cutter holders. Thus, for example, a plurality of magnets can be disposed on the second cam element connected rigidly to the control rod, the axial movement of the second cam element corresponding to the corresponding axial movement of the control rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if the tool holder has an electric voltage supply for the sensor unit, for example the Hall sensor, as it is thereby possible to dispense with an external electrical supply line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The sensor signal made available by the sensor unit is evaluated and processed in a conventional manner by means of an electronics unit. The latter is preferably located adjacent to the sensor unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment, the electronics unit can switch on and off automatically as a function of the rotation movement of the main body. It is thus possible to ensure that the electronics unit is switched on only when the main body is rotating and detection of the setting of the cutter holders is thus desired. Otherwise, the electronics unit is switched off, with the result that its power consumption is kept very low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To allow the sensor electronics to switch on and off automatically, the tool holder can comprise, for example, a reed switch and an associated magnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The sensor unit is preferably associated with an electrical data transmission unit for wireless transmission of the determined position data to a machine-side control. In this case, the transmission can be, for example, by radio signal or infrared signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if the tool holder comprises a tool head which can be connected releasably to the main body and on which the cutter holders are disposed, and a stationary housing enclosing the main body. This makes it possible, in a particularly simple and time-saving manner, to exchange the desired cutter holders with fixed cutter while the entire tool head is detached from the main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The stationary housing preferably accommodates the sensor unit together with associated electronics and voltage supply, and the reed switch too can be mounted on the housing.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The drawing shows a tool holder designated generally by reference number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This tool holder is intended for use on a machine tool and for this purpose can be coupled in a conventional manner to the machine spindle of the machine tool. The tool holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is mounted in a stationary manner on the machine tool by means of a torque support which is known per se and is therefore not shown in the drawing, which housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> surrounds a main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is disposed rotatably on the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by means of ball bearings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is driven in rotation by the machine tool. The main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotatable about an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is of substantially cylindrical configuration. For coupling to the machine spindle, the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a central recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on its rear end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> directed toward the machine tool. A conventional steep-taper shank could alternatively be provided for coupling purposes. On its front end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> directed away from the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> carries a tool head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which can be connected releasably to the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and on which, as can be gathered in particular from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, three cutter holders <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are mounted in a radially displaceable manner, which cutter holders <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed uniformly about a circumference and on each of which a cutter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively, is fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The cutter holders <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are actuated via a control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which engages in a longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> opens into the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is oriented coaxially with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and, at its free end projecting beyond the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has slide surfaces <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>;o which are each oriented obliquely at an angle of <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in relation to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and on each of which there is fixed a cutter holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively, with a carriage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An oblong hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> oriented transversely with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and passing through the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> forms a guide for a bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which passes through the oblong hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and which protrudes at both ends from the oblong hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and ensures that the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is mounted in the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in such a way that it is fixed in terms of rotation, but displaceable axially, i.e. coaxial to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The axial movement of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is, like its rotation movement, produced by the movement of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. To obtain the axial movement, the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is coupled to the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> via a control cam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a planetary gearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is coupled to the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The planetary gearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> comprises two toothed rings <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which are oriented coaxially with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and bear on a radially outwardly directed flange <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and two planetary wheels <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which are connected rigidly to one another, are mounted on a common axis <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in a seat <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and each mesh with a toothed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, respectively. The rotary movement of the first toothed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is transmitted via the two planetary wheels <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the rotatably mounted second toothed ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The transmission ratios of the planetary gearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are in this case chosen such that the second toothed ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a slightly higher speed of rotation than the first toothed ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A feed ring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which surrounds the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and can rotate relative to the latter is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the second toothed ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Adjoining this feed ring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the axial direction there is a second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which likewise surrounds the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> circumferentially and has a radial through-bore <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> into which the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> engages. The second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is connected to the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a rotationally fixed manner via the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In their mutual contact region, the two feed rings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> form the control cam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which, as can be gathered in particular from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, has a helical line portion <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> which is adjoined circumferentially by a rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. It is thus oriented obliquely with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result of the chosen transmission, the first feed ring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the second toothed ring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a slightly higher speed of rotation than the second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is connected to the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a rotationally fixed manner via the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Because of the oblique orientation of the control cam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the relative movement thereby obtained between the two feed rings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> results in an axial movement of the second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> coupled to the latter via the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> oriented parallel to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ensures that, after an initial axial movement in the direction of the front end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and with it the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, is returned abruptly to its original position. The result of this is that the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> executes an axially oriented reciprocating movement when the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is being driven in a rotary movement. In order to ensure that the second feed ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is displaced in the direction of the rear end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upon reaching the rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> carries, on its outside, two radially directed carrier pins, of which only one carrier pin <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is visible in the drawing. These carrier pins <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> each engage in a guide seat <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> disposed in a rotationally fixed manner on the first feed ring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and circumferentially adjacent to the rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, by which means it is ensured that the second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, rotating relative to the first feed ring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, abruptly resumes its original position when it reaches the rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is constructed in three parts and comprises a rear rod portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> through which the bolt <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> engages, a front rod portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which protrudes beyond the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> connecting the two rod portions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to one another. The middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> forms an adjustment mechanism by means of which the length of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be adjusted. For this purpose, the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is of cylindrical configuration and is mounted rotatably in the longitudinal bore <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On both of its end faces, the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in each case carries a guide bolt <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the rear guide bolt <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> engaging in a corresponding blind bore of the rear rod portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and being connected to the rear rod portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so as to be rotatable, but not axially displaceable, by way of a threaded pin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a corresponding circumferential groove <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. By contrast, the front guide bolt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, engaging in a corresponding blind bore of the front rod portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, has an external thread which corresponds with a corresponding internal thread of the front rod portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. If the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and with it the front guide bolt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, is rotated relative to the front rod portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the front rod portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is thereby screwed to a greater or lesser extent onto the guide bolt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The result of this is that the overall length of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be altered by rotation of the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. To be able to effect the rotation, the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> has a multiplicity of through-bores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> oriented transversely with respect to the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and, level with the through-bores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with an opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that, after removal of a cover <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> closing off the opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the through-bores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be accessed and the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can be rotated, via the opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, with the aid of a suitable tool engaging in one of the through-bores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The tool head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> surrounding the front end region of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the view of the tool head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, this sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has been omitted for reasons of improved clarity. At its free end, the sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is closed off by a cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which, again for reasons of clarity, has been omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Clamped between the sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the middle portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> there is a compression spring <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> which acts on the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with a spring force in the direction of its rearward position. This results in a force acting on the second feed ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has three radially oriented guide apertures <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which are disposed uniformly in the circumferential direction and at the same axial level, and in which the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are respectively mounted in such a way that they are nonrotatable but radially displaceable. On their front aspect directed away from the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> each carry a retaining pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which engages in a blind bore <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> formed in the cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> parallel to the guide apertures. The blind bores <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are each closed off by a threaded pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The threaded pins <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are each connected to one end of a helical return spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the other end of which is in each case fixed to a retaining pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is being driven in rotation by the machine spindle, then this results in a corresponding rotation movement of the tool head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. At the same time, as has already been explained, an axial movement of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is produced via the planetary gearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the control cam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, so that this control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> moves in a defined manner in the direction of the cover <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and in so doing displaces the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the cutters <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> disposed thereon, radially outward. The displacement of the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> here takes place counter to the force of the return spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In addition, the positive connection formed by the tension bolt <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the guide slot <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> ensures that the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, despite the considerable centrifugal forces acting on them, execute a defined radial movement and all three cutters <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can simultaneously come into engagement with the workpiece to be machined in order to produce a turned groove. Once the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> have reached a desired extended position, the rebound <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> formed on the feed rings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> results in a reverse movement of the control rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so that the carriages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> again assume their original retracted position. </paragraph>

By means of the reed switch <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the electronics unit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is actuated only in the event of a rotation movement of the main body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>.
