<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel thrombin inhibitors, to the preparation thereof and to the use thereof for controlling diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Thrombin belongs to the group of serine proteases and plays a central part in the blood coagulation cascade as terminal enzyme. Both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation cascade lead, via several amplifying stages, to the production of thrombin from prothrombin. The thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin then initiates blood coagulation and platelet aggregation, which in their turn enhance thrombin formation by the binding of platelet factor 3 and coagulation factor XIII as well as a whole series of highly active mediators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The formation and effect of thrombin are central events in the production both of white, arterial and of red, venous thrombi and therefore potentially effective points of attack for drugs. Thrombin inhibitors contrast with heparin in being able completely to inhibit, independently of cofactors, simultaneously the effects of thrombin both in the coagulation cascade and on platelets. They are able to prevent in the acute phase thromboembolic events after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and lysis and to serve as anticoagulants in extracorporeal circulation (heart-lung machine, hemodialysis). They can also be used generally for thrombosis prophylaxis, for example after surgical interventions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known that synthetic arginine derivatives influence the enzymic activity of thrombin by interacting with the active serine residue of the protease. Peptides based on Phe-Pro-Arg in which the N-terminal amino acid is in the D form have proved to be particularly beneficial. D-Phe-Pro-Arg isopropyl ester has been described as a competitive thrombin inhibitor (C. Mattson et al., Folia Haematol. 109 (1982) 43-51). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Derivatization of the C-terminal arginine to the aldehyde leads to an enhancement of the inhibitory action. Thus, a large number of arginals able to bind the hydroxyl group of the &ldquo;active&rdquo; serine as hemiacetal have been described (EP 185,390, 479,489, 526,877, 542,525; WO 93 15 756, 93 18 060). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The thrombin inhibitory activity of peptide ketones, fluorinated alkyl ketones and of keto esters, boric acid derivatives, phosphoric esters and &agr;-keto carboxamides can likewise be explained by this serine interaction (EP 118,280, 195,212, 362,002, 364,344, 410,411, 471,651, 589,741, 293,881, 503,203, 504,064, 530,167; WO 92 07 869; 94 08 941). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> DE 31 08 810 and WO 93 11 152 describe &ohgr;-aminoalkylguanidine dipeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The peptide 4-amidinophenylglycinephosphonate diphenyl esters described by J. Oleksyszyn et al. in J. Med. Chem. 37 (1994) 226-231 are irreversible thrombin inhibitors with inadequate selectivity for other serine proteases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> EP 601,459 and WO 94/29336, which are not prior publications, describe thrombin inhibitory peptides. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> A.III.1. The amidines, N-hydroxyamidines and N-aminoamidines are prepared from nitrites by a method derived from Vieweg et al. (H. Vieweg et al. Pharmazie 39 (1984) 226) as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> 1 eq of the nitrile is dissolved in pyridine/triethylamine (10/1; about 20-30 ml/g of substance). The solution is then saturated with H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S gas and left to stand in a closed vessel at RT overnight. The mixture is subsequently stirred into ice-water containing hydrochloric acid, and the resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed with a large amount of water and then dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> The substance is dissolved in acetone (about 20-30 ml/g of substance). MeI (1 ml/g of substance) is added and the solution is left to stand overnight. The S-methyl thioimidate hydroiodide is precipitated by adding diethyl ether and is reprecipitated from MeOH/diethyl ether to purify. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> The salt is introduced into abs. MeOH (about 30 ml/g of substance). After addition of ammonium acetate (hydroxylammonium acetate or chloride is used to synthesize N-hydroxyamidines, and hydrazinium acetate or chloride is used to synthesize N-aminoamidines), the mixture is stirred at RT overnight. The suspension is filtered and then part of the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the amidino &lsqb;sic&rsqb; hydroiodide is precipitated by adding ether and is filtered off with suction. The crude product is then purified by RP-HPLC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> A.III.2 Alternatively, the amidation is also carried out by a Pinner reaction (D. Neilson in Patai &ldquo;The Chemistry of Amidines and Imidates&rdquo; 385-489, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1975; R. Roger, D. Neilson Chem. Rev. 61 (1961) 179; also see Example 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> A.III.3 Another possibility for the amidation comprises conversion of a nitrile group into a hydroxyamidine group with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and subsequent hydrogenation with H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Raney nickel (or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Pd-C) to give the amidine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> 10 mmol of the nitrile derivative are dissolved in 100 ml of MeOH and, after addition of 3 eq of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 4.5 eq of TEA, stirred at room temperature until conversion is complete. The reaction mixture is subsequently concentrated and taken up in DCM. The organic phase is washed with water (pH 5-6), dried with Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and concentrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> The residue is dissolved in 100 ml of 5% strength methanolic HOAc and, after addition of Raney nickel (alternatively also Pd/C 10%), hydrogenated under a hydrogen atmosphere. After conversion of the precursor is complete, the catalyst is filtered off, and the filtrate is concentrated. The product is purified as required either by column chromatography on silica gel or reversed phase HPLC. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> 1.

The protective groups on the reaction centers for the subsequent coupling are eliminated between the individual coupling steps as customary in peptide chemistry. All the building blocks can either be bought or synthesized by methods disclosed in the literature or similar thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> 2. The syntheses can also take place in the reverse sequence by coupling H-N(R1)-C(R2R3)-(CH2)m-D-(NH)n-C(NH)NHR4 (R4 is a suitable protective group) to suitably protected W-B-COOH derivatives and subsequently A derivatives W-A-OH (see Scheme II). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> 3. The guanidine, amidine, N-hydroxyamidine and N-aminoamidine functionalities are either introduced in protected form (protonated or provided with suitable protective groups) with the building block H-N(R1)-C(R2R3)-(CH2)m-D-(NH)n-C(NH)NHR4 into the preparation of the active substances and subsequently deprotected, or else prepared after the coupling of the building blocks at the stage of W-A-B-CO-N(R1)-C(R2R3)-(CH2)m-D-NH2 by guanylation &lsqb;sic&rsqb; or of W-A-B-CO-N(R1)-C(R2R3)-(CH2)m-D-CN by amidation, N-hydroxyamidation or N-aminamidation.
