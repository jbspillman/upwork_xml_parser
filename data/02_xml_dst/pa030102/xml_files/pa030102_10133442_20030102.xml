<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an all steam iron, without an electric heat body in an iron main body, with which ironing is conducted with supplied steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in an all steam iron, without an electric heat body in an iron main body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, with which ironing is conducted with supplied steam, the supplied steam through a supplying passage is momentarily filled into a heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Then, when a steam valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is opened to jet the steam in ironing, the steam is sent to plural branched passage bores <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through the heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a suction opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the steam valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and a main passage <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and jetted from steam jets <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on a sole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the iron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is composed of an operational flat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a shell member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> welded each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each of the heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the main passage <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a pressure container which needs to be made of stainless steel for mechanical strength. Further, workability of the ironing is reduced because plate thickness of these members is large and the iron main body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> becomes quite heavy. Temperature of the sole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is low for the stainless having low heat conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> And, the operational flat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a shell member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which compose the heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, are welded of which welding amount is large and requires much labor for the welding, and reliability as a pressure container is not sufficient because the welding is conducted from the outside on only one side. Many other members (the main passage <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the branched passage bores <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) have problems in workability in production and in reliability as product because they are also composed and connected with welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an all steam iron which is having simple construction, safety, good heat efficiency, and light weight.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional side view of an embodiment of an all steam iron relating to the present invention. In the all steam iron, the steam is supplied from a means for steam generation and supply (a boiler) not shown in Figures to an iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a steam supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to conduct preheat and heat retention of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (a sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and jet the steam out of the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for ironing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The all steam iron of the present invention is, omitting a heat hollow chamber for preheat in the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, provided with the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a steam flow passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, etc. A cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for burning prevention made of plastic is disposed on an outside (an upper side) of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The heat hollow chamber is an enlarged space in the conventional all steam iron shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> forming a pressure container for keeping and supplying steam to hold the steam temporarily in the heat hollow chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for preheat and heat retention of the iron main body <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and then, jetting the steam out of the sole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The steam flow passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a pipe provided with a preheat circulation passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a branched passage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As described later in detail, the preheat circulation passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is composed as to flow the steam, transmit the heat, and warm (heat) the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the branched passage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is constructed as to be freely closed and opened to a pipe on the supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by switching the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> disposed on an upstream end of the branched passage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to jet the steam out of many steam jet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected to the branched passage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and disposed on the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the iron. The preheat circulation passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, forming a part of a circulation passage of the steam, is a part of a circulation passage in which the steam generated in the boiler passes the preheat circulation passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the steam supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the steam flows out of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (to circulate) in an arrow Z direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Open-and-close operation of the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is conducted by pushing a handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to open the valve by parting a valve body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from a valve seat <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to jet the steam. The valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is kept fully closed while the handle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is simply gripped, and the steam is not jetted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is showing a steam-jetting state in which the valve is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A top view of the all steam iron, in which the cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is removed, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of flat face, a branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along and parallel to the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is disposed above the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> parallel to the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is disposed above the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The many steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, each of which has a gradually spreading steam-jet portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are disposed on the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the steam jet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is communicatively connected to the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed unitedly of a block body. That is to say, a block body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed by casting or forging is bored by a drill to form non-penetrating bores as the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (the preheat circulation passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) and the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (the branched passage <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). Therefore, an initial end portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is sealed with welding or a plug as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The united block body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a united block body having no seam and, although not shown in Figures, a block body formed with unitedly assembled plural block bodies contact and being fixed each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an operational flat plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a middle layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in which the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed, an outer layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in which the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is disposed, a valve case portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in which the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is disposed, and a transfer piping portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to supply and exhaust the steam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The steam supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for supplying the steam in the arrow A direction is detachably attached to a rear end attachment portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the transfer piping portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an exhaust valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to exhaust the steam in the arrow Z direction is detachably attached to a rear end attachment portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a drain valve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (or a steam trap) to remove water drops generated in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The steam supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is inserted to the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to form a double-pipe passage, and length L of the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is set to be 200 mm to 500 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is communicatively connected to the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a first piping hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the transfer piping portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is communicatively connected to the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through a second piping hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the transfer piping portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. And, the steam is supplied to the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened in steam jet operation. That is to say, the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are freely connected and closed by the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, flowing of the steam is described. First, in non-jetting state in which the operation valve is closed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the steam flows from the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, through the first piping hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown by the arrow B, passing a spring side of the check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> described later (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), in the direction shown with arrows C and D in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a branch portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a confluence portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the steam passes through the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. One pair or several pairs of the branch portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the confluence portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be disposed as the steam circulates the whole area of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to warm uniformly. And, the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is eventually returns to one passage, the steam is sent out of the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrows E with the water drops through the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (shown with the arrow Z), and returned to the boiler side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The steam sent from the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the non-jetting state, in which the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is closed, is not sent to the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but let off on the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side as shown with an arrow F in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by opening the check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> disposed on an upstream side of the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (a side portion below the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). The check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is composed of, serially in the flowing direction shown by the arrow F, a ball <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a seat face <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a compression coil spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The steam, pushing the ball <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (to open the check valve), easily passes the check valve when the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is closed, and be sent to the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> communicatively connected to the spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the steam sent through the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is always let off on the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side even in the non-jetting state, generation of the water drops in the second piping hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is restricted because the steam does not stay in the second piping hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> communicatively connected to the upstream side (lower portion) of the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and water drops do not flow to the steam jet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) when switched to the steam jet operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, in the steam-jetting state in which the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the steam from the boiler, passing through the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown with an arrow H, flows in the arrow I direction in the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, has a main bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and many branch bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and many steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the main bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the branch bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>penetrate the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. And, the steam flows also into the branch bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as shown with arrows J, and the steam in the branch bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is jetted out of the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also in this steam-jetting state, as described above, the steam passes through the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to heat the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and retain the heat, and circulates toward the boiler side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as described above, is opened and working as to send the steam supplied from the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the non-jetting state, and closed to prevent the water drops, generated and remaining in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, from flowing back to the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side in the steam-jetting state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the non-jetting state, the water drops generated in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> do not backflow to the second piping hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) side even when the check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is opened because the steam supplied from the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> flows to the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side with a considerable flowing speed when the check valve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, inserted to the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the steam supplying hose <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is opening in the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a predetermined length L to suck the steam. The predetermined length L is a length to prevent the water drops generated in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from flowing back to the first supplying passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> side, or to prevent the water drops generated in the first piping hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the attachment portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> from intruding to the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> communicatively connected to the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> side. So needless water drops are not blown out of the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the length L is less than 200 mm, water drops easily intrude to the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. On the contrary, when the length L is more than 500 mm, the tube as the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is excessive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the steam flow passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (the branched passage bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), composed of passage in which the steam flows, inner pressure does not become excessively high because the steam has its flowing speed. And, cross-section of the bore is preferably circular with which plate thickness of the pipe wall of the steam flow passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is thin even if the pressure (inner pressure) of the steam in the steam flow passage <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made with light metals such as aluminum and aluminum alloy because stress generated in the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is small and stable for the pipe wall composed of the block body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as described above. The iron made with aluminum has improved characteristics as an iron because aluminum has good heat conductivity and very preferable for heat transmission and efficiency with the steam in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Other than aluminum, titanium, magnesium, or an alloy of these metals may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With the construction above, the iron main body can be made thin and compact. Therefore, the outer face of the cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not hot when the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has high heat because the iron has the space <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as an air layer between the plastic cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, so safety is kept because worker&apos;s hand touching the cover <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> does not get burnt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the all steam iron of the present invention, with a rational construction as a pressure-resistant construction for flowing the steam as a pressure fluid in which the steam passes only through the passages having small cross-sectional area without a heat chamber as a large hollow portion, a safe all steam iron having a simplified and light-weight construction is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Adding to the effect above, the steam is freely jetted out of the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the operation valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the iron main body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented from reducing the temperature during a long period of steam jetting. Therefore, ironing is always conducted very neatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> And, state and distribution of stress by the inner pressure of the steam are uniform and stable, the all steam iron is made safe and of simple construction. Therefore, the iron can be formed with light metals having rather low mechanical strength and good heat conductivity to improve the workability of ironing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> And, the generation of water drops in the passages is prevented because the steam can be always sent to the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the steam does not stay also in the non-jetting state, and excessive water drops are not jetted out of the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the garment being ironed when switched to the steam-jetting state. And, the excessive water drops are not jetted out of the steam jets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the garment being ironed when switched to the steam-jetting state because the water drops remaining in the preheat circulation passage bore <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is prevented from flowing back to the second supplying passage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> side. Therefore, ironing is always conducted very neatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, the iron is made very light. And, workability of ironing is remarkably improved because the temperature on the sole <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in this specification, it is to be understood that the invention is illustrative and not restrictive, because various changes are possible within the spirit and indispensable features. </paragraph>
