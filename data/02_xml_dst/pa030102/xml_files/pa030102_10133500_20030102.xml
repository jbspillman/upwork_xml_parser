<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to imaging devices and more particularly to devices for imaging fingerprints and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fingerprint analysis is amongst the most widely used and studied biometric techniques. During the last two decades, many new and exciting developments have taken place in the field of fingerprint science, summarized for example in the monograph <highlight><italic>Advances in Fingerprint Technology, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ed., edited by H. C. Lee and R. E. Gaensslen (CRC Press, 2001). Fingerprint identification not only plays a major role in forensic or police science, but also in controlling the building-access or information-access of individuals to buildings, rooms, and devices such as computer terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When facing the task of actually imaging a given fingerprint, a problem associated with fingerprint imagers concerns the reliable and accurate transformation of the ridge and trough pattern of the fingertip into electrical or optical signals to be stored in a digital format. To achieve this task, optical systems are well known in the art, and were described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,427 to Yang issued Apr. 28, 1992, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,748 to Lee, issued Feb. 16, 1993, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,233,404 to Lougheed et al. issued Aug. 3, 1993. However, such devices require sophisticated equipment and tend to be bulky and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to overcome some of the limitations and disadvantages associated with optical systems based on illumination of the fingertip, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,056 to Tsikos issued Oct. 5, 1982, an alternative kind of fingerprint imager that uses a capacitive sensing approach, is disclosed. The described sensor has a two dimensional array of capacitors, each of which comprises a pair of spaced electrodes, carried in a sensing member and covered by an insulating film. The sensors rely upon deformation to the sensing member caused by a finger being placed thereon, so as to locally vary the spacing between capacitor electrodes, and hence the capacitance of the capacitors, according to the ridge and trough pattern of the fingerprint. Although this device may not suffer from the problems associated with the kind of sensor employing an optical sensing technique, it suffers from its own problems. The difficulties that arise are mainly related to circuitry, the need of capacitor charging, and component connections. Thus, in another attempt to improve upon deficiencies and limitations of the aforementioned and other prior art, a further contact-imaging device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,442 to Knapp issued Jun. 28, 1994. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Knapp teaches a capacitance measuring imaging device in the form of a single large active matrix array, using deposition and definition by photolithographic processes of a number of layers on a single large insulating substrate. Although Knapp&apos;s attempt provides an improvement over Tsikos&apos; device mentioned above, other disadvantages and limitations become evident in the implementation of a manufacturing process. Such a process relies on a single large imaging contact device, which often is a silicon die cut from a silicon wafer. Since a contact area of approximately 5 cm is needed for imaging a fingerprint, the silicon devices are costly to manufacture, they have a low manufacturing yield, they are fragile, and thus have limited use in contact applications. These fragility and cost limits prohibit the widespread use of capacitive imaging of fingerprints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Reducing the size of the imaging array is beneficial to limit cost and production yield limitations. That said, an imager with significantly reduced size is likely to be even more fragile than a larger imager. In U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/984,354 filed on Oct. 30, 2001, an imaging system is described that includes a small capacitive array of sense elements in conjunction with a processor for forming a composite image of a fingerprint from a plurality of images of small sections of a single fingertip captured, for example, during a swiping motion. The sensing device is disposed between protective surfaces and supported by a flexible structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, due to friction between a fingertip and a swipe fingerprint sensor, the fingerprint imaged thereby is deformed. Different amounts of pressure, different dryness or moisture levels, different swipe speeds, and different swipe directions result in very different raw image data. Of course, for best results in fingerprint analysis, similar images are preferred and as such, reproducible imaging would be highly desirable. Unfortunately, this desire to have reproducible imaging frustrates widespread implementation of swipe fingerprint scanners such as the one mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To make even better practical use of swipe fingerprint scanners, it would be advantageous to achieve enhanced control over the movement of the biological surface to be sensed relative to the swipe scanner surface, in at least one of space or time. A precise and well-controlled relative motion is particularly desirable in situations where the imager is operated in an environment with a high level of vibrational disturbance. It would be further advantageous to provide a device that reduces mechanical stress applied to the image-sensing device, thus increasing the robustness of the swipe imager. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on the apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,089 to Borza issued Jul. 7, 1998, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,989 to Borza issued Dec. 25, 2001, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/984,354. The description of the present invention will therefore closely relate to the above-mentioned patents and application, and the parts of the disclosures of these patents and application not included in this specification are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The central unit of the present invention is a group of sensor elements comprising r rows or arrays (1 to r) with c sensing elements or columns (1 to c) in each row. In practice there are about 300 rows and 200 columns of regularly spaced elements occupying an area of approximately 3&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. This area is for accepting a fingertip for scanning. The sense elements comprise a sensing electrode and an amplifier circuit wherein the amplifier circuit amplifies voltage induced in the sensing electrode by a biological source, for example a fingertip. The sense elements are arranged as to form a first swipe sensing pad, having a specific capacitive detective area, for sensing variations of a specific property of a biological source, and a second swipe sensing pad for detecting motion of the sensed variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a fingertip is passed across the first and the second swipe sensing pad, successive rows across the fingertip are imaged. The resulting rows are known in one path dimension but the spacing of the rows along the other dimension is unknown. Therefore, a comparison of the imaging results from the first swipe sensing pad and those from the second swipe sensing pad is used to determine spacing and thereby allow for fingerprint reconstruction. Typically, a processor is used to correlate data previously received from the first swipe sensing pad and data received from the second swipe sensing pad to provide correlation results, which are indicative of a known physical distance between data sensed by the first swipe sensing pad and the data sensed by the second swipe sensing pad. The second swipe sensing pad does not need to be as topographically sensitive as the first swipe sensing pad. In this regard, the second swipe sensing pad may have a lower resolution than the first swipe sensing pad thereby reducing component costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Monitoring the motion of the biological source to be scanned allows one to use a total scanning area effectively smaller than the size of the area to be sensed. Timing and sequencing logic implemented in the correlation processor selects each element in the array in turn to produce a partial image of a fingerprint presented to the device. A series of partial images is used to construct a composite image of the fingerprint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The use of a swipe sensing pad sufficient in breadth to span a surface to be imaged but insufficient along an orthogonal dimension to image the entire surface for capturing an image of a fingerprint requires that the swipe sensing pad senses and provides data at a rate to ensure that the data is correctly captured. It often is preferable to install a motion sensor that provides a separate data stream, informing the system of the relative motion of the fingertip along an axis substantially perpendicular to the breadth of the swipe sensing pad. It is advantageous to perform the process of image analysis in conjunction with the motion sensor data as this allows for compensation for slip in the motion sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a side view of the ridges of a fingertip is presented. The ridges are approximately smooth curves. Two possible swipe directions are indicated in the drawing, a first direction <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a second direction <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, being direction opposite to the direction <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When the fingertip is statically pressed against a contact imager such as a swipe sensing pad or a prior art optical contact imager, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the ridges become flattened due to pressure of the fingertip against the platen. Also, the ridges tend away from the point of maximum pressure. This tendency is usually slight and normally does not affect fingerprint analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a side view of the ridges of a fingertip is presented, as the fingertip is swiped across a platen in the direction <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Swiping of a fingerprint may be necessary, when the area of the sensing device is too small to monitor the fingerprint as one single image, and when the complete image is reconstructed from a series of partial images. Here, the ridges are deformed being pulled in one direction <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by friction of the platen. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows a similar diagram for the fingertip being swiped in the opposing direction <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As is evident, the ridges move relative to the finger and the effects of swiping the finger in opposite directions are different resulting in different fingerprint images. Those differences are often sufficient to effect image analyses and automated fingerprint recognition. Further, if a fingertip is swiped across the swipe sensing pad back and forth, formation of a composite image is difficult due to the different distortions. Also, the distortion of the fingerprint pattern greatly complicates the process of sensing reproducible images in repeated scanning events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. A swipe imager <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprises a swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in form of a parallelepiped. The spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides a distance between a biological surface to be sensed and the swipe sensing pad, thus reducing the amount of fingerprint deformation due to friction, and allowing for reproducible fingerprint imaging. As a further advantage of using the spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, less of a mechanical stress is applied to the swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reducing the risk of mechanical damage to the sensor array. Additionally, the spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> helps to ensure that the surface of the finger being scanned is not being smeared against the scanning surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Many different configurations for a spacer are possible. For example, a raised profile will perform adequately. A parallelepiped or a plurality of parallelepipeds, a roller or a plurality of rollers, or any combination of one or more rollers and one or more parallelepipeds all are possible realizations of the raised profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A swipe imager <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comprises the swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which operates as the spacer. A mounting <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for supporting the roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is also provided. The roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a motion sensor device, which reduces an amount of redundant information that the swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> captures, and provides additional information for image construction. Thus, for example, the swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> does not begin capturing data until the motion sensor registers the motion of the fingertip. Once the finger motion is acknowledged, additional information from the motion sensor allows for determining of the speed at which the finger is moving across the swipe sensing pad, and for adjusting the swipe sensing pad data capture frequency accordingly. Of course, the same advantages described for the spacer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in form of a parallelepiped do also apply for the roller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> operating as a spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a second roller is incorporated into the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, a capacitive swipe imager <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a first roller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a second roller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Mountings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for supporting the rollers are also presented. The swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed between said first and second rollers. Using this configuration has the benefit of alleviating compressive deformation of the fingertip in the region between the rollers, which is the region where the imaging device is situated. The reduced deformation is present regardless of the direction in which the fingertip is moved across the rollers along a same line. Of course, due to the curved upper surface of the rollers, increased pressure thereon results in the skin of the fingertip being stretched further across the circumference resulting in equal or less pressure between the rollers. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, respectively. As is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the fingertip rests at a height below the top of the rollers and closer to the swipe sensing pad in normal use. As the user pushes harder against the rollers, the skin stretches between the rollers, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and consequently, any compressive deformation of the fingerprint is relieved. Thus, even if the user pushes excessively, the fingerprint will not be deformed substantially in the area of the scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When additional pressure is applied, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the fingertip rests slightly further from the swipe sensing pad but still within design tolerances. Of course, the distance between the rollers and the height of the top of the rollers from the swipe sensing pad surface affect the proximity of the skin to the swipe sensing pad and the effects of pressure applied by the fingertip. The additional pressure is absorbed by the rollers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and by the mountings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> instead of by the swipe sensing pad, thereby preventing damage to delicate electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When a biasing device is used to absorb overpressure applied to the sensing element, it is preferred that the biasing device be mounted to the sensing element and rollers combination such that the rollers and sensing element are in fixed relation one to another. Alternatively, the rollers and sensing element are spaced differently depending on the applied pressure in order to result in approximately uniform spacing between the fingertip and the sensing element or, when in contact, to result in approximately uniform pressure there between. Optionally, some contact is maintained between the finger surface and the outer surface of the sensing element. This is a function of roller spacing and sensing element height relative to an upper surface of the rollers. Further, this is determined based on design requirements and other factors that are easily analyzed through simple experimentation to determine an ideal height between the rollers and the sensing element and distance between the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the first roller of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with a motion sensor. Further optionally, the second roller of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also provided with a motion sensor. By receiving data from each of two motion sensors, false motion sensor data in the form of slip or additional spin are detectable. Thus the additional motion sensor data enhances the accuracy of the sensed motion of the fingertip in the vicinity of the swipe sensing pad. When, for example, one sensor indicates motion and the other does not, the error is indicative of less reliable data. Since image analysis is typically used in conjunction with motion sensor data to construct the composite image, the motion sensor data is validated by analysis of the image data. When both sensors are in accord, the image data is validated based on the sensor data and image analysis. Thus, three independent measures of skin motion are used in the construction of the composite image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As another possibility, more than two rollers are provided to the swipe imager. In cases where more than one swipe sensing pad is present, the presence of more than two rollers allows to frame each sensor pad by a pair of rollers, thus establishing a defined motion and a defined spacing of the biological surface with respect to each of the swipe sensing pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In context of the devices described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, many different configurations for a motion sensor are possible. For example, a roller with a simple rotational speed feedback element will perform adequately. Alternatively, a second continuously active scanner aligned perpendicularly to the first scanner will provide feedback signals useable to determine the speed of the finger as it swipes the first scanner. Further, as shown, the roller and the sensing array are combined into one single unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a top-view of a contact imaging device for imaging continuously a biological surface according to a further embodiment of the present invention is shown, in which the function of the roller and the sensing array are combined into one device. A roller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having affixed to the surface thereof a plurality of arrays <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of capacitive imaging elements, each of which is made of a plurality of individual sensing elements (not shown), is provided within a recessed body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The plurality of arrays <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forms a swipe sensing pad. The arrays are separated by a known distance Ad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a side-view of the contact-imaging device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is shown. The roller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> partially protrudes above the surface of the recessed body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for frictionally engaging a biological surface being swiped, for example, in the direction of the arrow. The swiping motion of the biological surface effectively drags the roller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, causing the roller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to rotate within recessed body <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Mountings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for supporting the roller are also provided. Further, a communication bus <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for transmitting the data indicative of the imaged features of the fingerprint to a processor is provided, which optionally is integral with the mountings for supporting the roller. As such, the arrays of capacitive sensing elements <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, being embedded within the surface of the roller <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, are presented to different portions of the biological surface at different times. The spacing of the different scanned images produced by individual arrays is known because the distance Ad between a first and a second array is known. As an advantage, problems associated with swiping a fingertip at different rates are obviated since the spatial relationship between each of the plurality of sensing elements is known and invariant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The rollers described in the above embodiments are cylindrical in shape. Optionally, the rollers do not have a flat cylindrical surface, but are provided with a concave indentation. This indentation serves to accept a finger or a fingertip, and to guide the finger or the fingertip during the process of imaging a biological surface. Advantageously, the concave indentation places the finger or fingertip at a defined position on the roller, where an integrated sensor is located. Further optionally, the rollers are provided with a convex lifting. This lifting serves to accept a palm, and to guide the palm during the process of imaging a biological surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Whereas the roller as described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provides an enhanced control in time over the motion of the biological surface to be scanned, it lacks the possibility to precisely control the spatial position of the biological surface with respect to the imaging device. Not only the relative orientation with respect to the individual sensing elements is important, but also the relative spacing between the sensing area and the biological surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in another embodiment of the invention the swipe sensing pad <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is integrated into a guiding channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, comprised of a base <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and two sidewalls <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The sidewalls are spaced apart as to snuggly but comfortably enclose a human index finger. The guiding channel limits the motion of a fingertip (not shown) to the correct direction, as it passes in close proximity to the swipe sensing pad. The swipe sensing pad is mounted in a recess in the base <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the channel to prevent excessive pressure being placed upon it while in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates, how horizontal rollers <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and vertical rollers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> form the walls of the guiding channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This alleviates stresses on the user&apos;s fingers while maintaining pressure on the finger to maintain alignment. Advantageously, the horizontal rollers <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are optionally provided with a motion-sensing device, and fulfill the same functionality as the ones described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the guiding channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is shown but closed on four sides. This locks the finger into only a linear motion. Unfortunately, because different people have fingers of different sizes, such an embodiment is difficult to reliably construct. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, an embodiment is presented, wherein pairs of opposing sides, such as base <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and top <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or the two sidewalls <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are biased one relative to another to secure the finger in place against the swipe sensing pad. The finger can be pushed into and pulled out of the housing but is maintained in an approximately linear direction of motion to improve quality of the fingertip image. The relative motion of each pair of sides relative to each other is for example achieved by sets of rollers, either horizontal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> or vertical <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which are attached to the sides in such a wide that a certain margin of horizontal or vertical movement is provided for. Such an embodiment is useful in environments with shock and vibration that would cause the fingertip to move in an unintended direction relative to the swipe sensing pad during a process of swiping. Again, the rollers are optionally used to provide motion related data signals for determining a location of the fingertip as it passes over the sensing element in order to facilitate composite image construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A base <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises an imaging device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a first roller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and a second roller <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Hingedly attached to the base is a top cover <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which can be opened and closed, as well as locked in a certain position. When closed, the base <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the top part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> form a housing similar to the one described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the housing is open, a finger, which fingertip is to be scanned, is placed on the base <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The top <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is swung close, and locked in a closed position. The housing is then pulled away from the finger or the finger is pulled from the housing. Thus, the fingerprint is imaged. This embodiment is particularly suitable for use in ambulances, since the fingerprint can be imaged even during vehicle motion and with a patient that is not conscious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments thereof, various changes and modifications can be carried out by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, it is intended that the present invention encompass such changes and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
