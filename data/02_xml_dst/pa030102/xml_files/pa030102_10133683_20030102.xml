</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pattern correction method, which corrects layout data for a circuit pattern of a semiconductor integrated circuit, and a pattern correction apparatus. In particular it relates to an optical proximity correction (OPC) pattern correction method, which corrects for the optical proximate effect, and a pattern correction apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accompanying the miniaturization and increased integration of semiconductor integrated circuits, prevention of decreases in yield due to the optical proximate effect during the photolithography process has become an important issue. More specifically, in the case of forming a circuit pattern using the photolithography process, due to the optical proximate effect, the edge of the actually exposed and finished interconnect pattern is shortened in comparison with layout patterns such as those designed using computer-aided design (CAD) system. This phenomenon is called &ldquo;shortening&rdquo;. As the circuit is further miniaturized and line width becomes narrow, the shortening of the exposed pattern becomes remarkable. When shortening occurs, the VIA contact hole connecting interconnects of different levels may be incompletely covered by the metal interconnect of the upper level or lower level. In addition, the shortening due to the optical proximate effect occurs not only in the metal interconnect pattern, but also in the VIA pattern connecting the interconnect pattern between the different levels. In the case where shortening occurs in the VIA pattern, VIA resistance rises remarkably, and in the worst case, disconnection may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to compensate for post-exposure shortening before it occurs, optical corrective processing called optical proximity correction (OPC) is applied to the metal interconnect pattern and layout data of VIA pattern in the design phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a generally used OPC processing method, a correction target edge of the metal interconnect to be connected through a VIA is first extracted based on the designed layout data. The distance between the extracted correction target edge and a proximal graphics pattern is calculated. Then, referencing a rule table, correction is applied in only the amount of correction corresponding to the calculated distance. Such OPC processing is achieved through a graphics processing function provided in the general design rule checker (DRC) tool or in combination with the DRC function. In addition, there are also cases where a specific function is developed and used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In OPC processing, as the targets for correction are extracted one by one, the proximal graphics pattern must be searched and the distance to the graphics pattern must be calculated. In the case of a large-scale integrated circuit, since the number of metal interconnects and VIA graphics is huge, a great deal of time is required to perform graphics processing and distance calculation for the OPC processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the optical proximate effect at the end of the interconnect feels real influence from the surrounding two-dimensional environment, it is necessary to judge the proximal status of the surrounding graphics. In the OPC processing method, the surrounding environment is judged in relation to only one direction, for example, in relation to only the X direction or Y direction of an XY plane. As a result, correction accuracy is poor, and ultimately satisfactory accuracy cannot be achieved in the post-exposure pattern created. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an outline of optical proximity correction (OPC) according to the first embodiment of the present invention. OPC is initiated by entering layout data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> created by an automated design unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as CAD, into an OPC correction processing unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The OPC correction processing unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> applies pattern correction to layout data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, such as an interconnect pattern designed with CAD, in anticipation of the optical proximate effect caused by the exposure a micro pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> During this pattern correction, the input design layout data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is converted to replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a replacement processing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while referencing a cell replacement table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The replacement layout data is transmitted to an OPC correction pattern creation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Referencing a cell library <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for OPC correction, the OPC correction pattern creation unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> imports a substantive post-correction pattern and outputs mask data <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a more specific processing flow chart for the OPC correction processing unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. To begin with, at Step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, design layout data, which has been designed through automation, is received. At Step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not a target cell, which is the target of correction, exists in the design layout data. In the case where the target cell exists (YES in S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), processing proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and an environmental profile is determined based on whether or not another graphics pattern exists around this target cell. Determination of the environmental profile will be described later. In addition, at Step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the target cell name is replaced with a prescribed cell name of a correction pattern corresponding to the determined environmental profile by referencing the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The cell replacement table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a table that stores symbols (cell names) indicating the most appropriate correction shape for the environment for each of the respective graphics pattern location statuses (i.e., environments) surrounding of the target cell. Since cell name is indicated by a simple symbol, capacity is small and table structure is simple. Accordingly, the amount of processing and time spent on the replacement process is very short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Environmental profile determination (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) and replacement processing (S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) while referencing the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are repeatedly implemented for each cell until there are no more correction target cells. When there are no more correction target cells (NO in S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), at Step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, where all of the cells to be corrected have been converted into the appropriate cell names, is output. The replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> not only includes the actual post-correction patterns but also the symbols (cell names) representing the post-correction patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, at Step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, while referencing the cell library <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for OPC correction, the actual corrected pattern corresponding to the cell name of the target cell in the replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is read in. The cell library indexes an actual corrected pattern with the cell name for each name listed in the cell replacement table and stores them. By referencing the cell library, a symbol (cell name), which is determined according to the environment surrounding of the target cell, into expanded to substantive mask data. At Step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the post-OPC correction layout data is output as mask data <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> illustrate replacement processing examples when a VIA pattern, which connects an upper-level interconnect and a lower-level interconnect, has been selected as a target cell to be used as the target of correction. The VIA cells included in the entered layout data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, configured by a sub-cell (VIA lower-level metal sub-cell) <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which indicates the end portion of a lower-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a sub-cell (VIA upper-level metal sub-cell) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which indicates the end portion of an upper-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a sub-cell <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which indicates the VIA level that connects them. Replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is output from a replacement processing unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by employing replacement processing on these VIA cells. The VIA cells included in the replacement layout data <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, identified by the names of Via_vm, Via_umm, and Via_lmb. In other words, referencing the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the VIA level, the input VIA-level sub-cell is replaced with the name of Via_vm. Similarly, the upper-level metal sub-cell and lower-level metal sub-cell are replaced with the names of Via_umm and Via_lmb, respectively, by referencing the corresponding cell replacement table 14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> These replacement processes are not limited to the VIA cells but implemented for arbitrary patterns included in the design layout data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a more detailed processing flow of the OPC processing for VIA cells configured with the three sub-cells shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. OPC correction of the VIA cells is implemented, for example, by chip for each chip on the semiconductor wafer. Individual VIA cells included in the layout data <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, which is entered from the automated design unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, are each regarded as a targets for processing, and processing is repeated until the processing for all VIAs is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> At Step S<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a search is performed to determine whether unprocessed VIA patterns exist in the entered layout data. If unprocessed VIA patterns exist, at Step S<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, the environmental profile is determined by examining the graphics pattern location environment surrounding the upper-level metal sub-cell configuring this VIA. At Step S<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, the target cell name is replaced with a prescribed cell name of a correction pattern corresponding to the determined environmental profile by referencing the replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the VIA upper-level metal sub-cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Similarly, at Steps S<highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, the environmental profile is determined for the VIA-level sub-cell, and the target cell name is replaced with a prescribed cell name of a correction pattern corresponding to the determined environmental profile by referencing the replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for the VIA-level sub-cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At Steps S<highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, similar processes are applied to the VIA lower-level metal sub-cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for the convenience of this description, the upper-level metal sub-cell, the VIA-level sub-cell, and lower-level metal sub-cell are processed in this order; however, they may be replaced in parallel by simultaneously referencing the corresponding tables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Replacement layout data <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> can be obtained once replacement of every sub-cell of all VIAs has been completed. All cell names in the replacement layout data <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are converted to a substantive corrected pattern by referencing the VIA cell library <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for OPC correction, and at Step S<highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, mask data is output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</cross-reference> illustrate the specific structure of the sub-cell replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for VIA upper-level metal and a method for determining the environmental profile. In the examples shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</cross-reference>, the environmental profile is determined through a two-dimensional investigation of the pattern location surrounding the VIA upper-level metal sub-cell. An upper-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed extending toward the X direction. Typically, in the case of a multi-level interconnect structure, all interconnects formed in the same level are formed in the same direction (e.g., X direction). Accordingly, in the case of an orthogonal-system interconnect, the lower-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is constructed in the Y direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> illustrates a method for determining an environmental profile in the case where the target VIA cell exists at the right end of the upper-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The grid at the surrounding of the upper-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is divided into seven segments, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In the case where a graphics pattern, such as another interconnect, exists in each segment, a binary value of 1 is assigned; otherwise, 0 is assigned. In the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, since there are no graphics patterns in any of the segment, the environmental profile is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). The environmental profiles of all possibly occurring combinations (in this example, 2 to the power of 7 (2<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>) kinds) are determined through this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once the environmental profile is determined, a cell name, which is the symbol indicating the most appropriate shape under that environment, is searched from the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and the layout data is replaced with that name. The cell name corresponding to the environment (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is VIA_uma. In the case where there is another interconnect in the surroundings and the environmental profile is (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1), it is ultimately corrected into the correction graphics pattern represented by the cell name Via_umm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, in the case where the target VIA cell exists at the left end of the metal interconnect, assignment of the segment numbers in the opposite direction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> allows the sub-cell replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be shared with the case where the VIA cell exists at the right end. In this case, the post-replacement cell is subjected to a horizontal mirror inversion and used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> respectively illustrate a cell replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of VIA-level sub-cell that configure the target VIA cell and an environment determination method. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the surroundings of the VIA-level sub-cell are divided into eight segments, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the environmental profile is determined based on whether another VIA pattern exists not within the segment but at the respective interconnect grid points of each segment. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, since there are no graphics patterns in the surroundings, the environmental profile is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). When such an environmental profile is obtained, the most appropriate corresponding correction shape is represented by the cell name, Via<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>va, by referencing the replacement table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. Accordingly, this VIA-level sub-cell is replaced with the cell name, Via_va. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Once the replacement process is completed, processing similar to that for the upper-level metal sub-cell is applied to the lower-level metal sub-cell of the VIA in question. In other words, at Step S<highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, the environmental profile is determined in relation to the lower-level metal sub-cell, and at Step S<highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, the determined environmental profile is replaced with the corresponding name by referencing the replacement table <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for the lower-level metal sub-cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The environment of the VIA lower-level metal sub-cell is determined by a similar method and the target cell name is replaced with a prescribed cell name of a correction pattern using tables similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</cross-reference>, however, they are not shown in the figure. Once replacement processing has been finished for all VIAs on the chip, the replacement layout data is complete. As described above, the replacement layout data is configured with the cell name representing the corrected shape. The mask data is ultimately completed by expanding the cell name of the replacement layout data into to actual graphics pattern data while referencing the VIA cell library for OPC correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 11</cross-reference> illustrate specific examples of the OPC corrected pattern creation processing for expansion to the substantive data. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the environmental profile of the upper-level metal sub-cell is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), and the replacement layout data has the cell name, Via_uma, indicating the correction shape that is most appropriate for the environment. Since a VIA cell library <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> stores the actual graphics pattern data corresponding to each cell name, a correction shape corresponding to the cell name Via_uma can be obtained by referencing the VIA cell library <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this case, the correction shape is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> with solid line, is a square, which is created by enlarging the end portion of the upper interconnect metal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> entirely. The square shown with dotted line at the center is the VIA cut pattern. Since there are no extra graphics patterns surrounding the environmental profile shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> correction shape, which is created by enlarging the end portion (upper-level metal sub-cell) of the upper interconnect metal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> uniformly in each of the four directions, is selected beforehand, and stored in the cell library <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. By reading this correction shape from the cell library <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, it is possible to obtain the substantive correction pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> with solid line. Thus, the end portion of the upper-level metal interconnect is corrected to a pattern, which is created by enlarging at the surround of the VIA cut in advance, prior to the actual exposure. As the result, it can be prevented from causing the shortening at the edge even in the case of exposing a miniaturized interconnect pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an example of OPC correction in the case where another interconnect exists at the surrounding of the upper-level metal interconnect of the target VIA cell. The environmental profile is determined as (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) based on whether or not graphics patterns exist in each segment surrounding of the target VIA. Referencing the cell replacement table, the cell name presenting the most appropriate correction shape is Via_umm. Referencing the VIA cell library, the substantive correction pattern corresponding to this cell name is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C, a</cross-reference> rectangle, which is created by enlarging largely to the right side and widely to the bottom side of the VIA cut. When this correction pattern is read from the VIA cell library, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the upper-level metal interconnect becomes a graphics pattern, which is enlarged to the right and left sides of the edge. By creating such correction pattern in the phase of mask data, it is possible to prevent from causing the shortening at the exposure without contacting with the adjacent interconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The most appropriate OPC correction pattern according to each environmental profile should be created by using a lithography simulator and the like, and should be registered in the VIA cell library for OPC correction in advance. It takes a time for this operation itself, however, since this operation can be performed in advance independent of the individual product process, the OPC process time for each product is not influenced. In addition, once a library is created, it may be used in common with the OPC correction process for different products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C illustrate an example of correction process for the VIA-level sub-cell, which connects between upper-level metal and lower-level metal. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, other VIA cut patterns exist at the interconnect grid point at right and upper sides of the eight segment surrounding of the VIA-level sub-cell. Accordingly, this environmental profile is (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), and the corresponding name in the replacement table <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is Via_vm. The actual correction graphics pattern corresponding to Via_vm is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C, a</cross-reference> shape where a serif is added to the lower left corner of the square. When this correction pattern is read from the cell library based on the cell name and expanded into a mask pattern, a masked pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a correction example of the VIA-level sub-cell with a more complicated shape. In this example, serifs having different sizes are applied to the four corners of the square and an indent is formed at one edge according to the obtained environmental profile. In the first embodiment, since the most appropriate correction graphics pattern according to each environmental profile is stored in the cell library by using a simulator and the like in advance, it is easy to apply the correction process even in the case of applying the OPC correction to the complicated shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Whatever the surrounding environment of the target cell is, the environmental profile is forthwith determined, and the cell name indicating the corrected graphics pattern, which is most appropriate for the determined environmental profile, is searched from the replacement table. Based on the cell name, the corresponding actual correction pattern can be acquired from the cell library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The cell replacement table and cell library can be stored in the internal memory of the OPC correction unit or in the external memory in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The mask data, which is expanded into the actual correction pattern by referencing the cell library, is stored in, for example, a floppy diskette or a magneto-optical disk such as a CD-ROM, and input into a mask image rendering unit (not shown in the figure). Alternatively, it is transferred from the OPC correction apparatus directly to the mask rendering unit via the network, such as a LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The OPC correction method mentioned above can be stored in recording media as a pattern correction process program. In this case, when design layout data designed by CAD and the like is entered into the OPC correction unit, the OPC correction process is automatically initiated. The recording media in which the pattern correction program is stored are: a semiconductor memory including a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, and a MO disk; a magnetic disk; an optical disk; and a magnetic optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment, the most appropriate correction patterns for all possible environments are respectively registered in the library beforehand. An unique name is applied to each correction pattern in the library, and the name and environment are stored in the environmental table by associating them. Accordingly, the most appropriate correction shape according to the surrounding environment can also be imported in the layout data in the OPC correction phase for each cell of the different products. The time spent on pattern correction and amount of data can be greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition, since it is different from the correction method in that the existence of other graphics patterns is examined not only toward only one direction of the cell of interest but toward 360 degrees of the cell, it is possible to perform highly accurate pattern correction in the two-dimensional plane. As the result, the reliability of the exposed interconnect pattern is enhanced, and when applied to a semiconductor integrated circuit, the reliability of device operation is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the correction of multi-level interconnect patterns in the rectangular coordinate system was described. In the second embodiment, pattern correction for diagonal interconnect is described while referencing FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The case where the lower-level metal interconnect extends toward the prescribed direction (e.g., horizontal direction) on the rectangular coordinate system and the upper-level metal interconnect at the upper level extends toward diagonal direction at the prescribed angle with the lower-level horizontal interconnect is considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates segments for determining the environmental profile for the upper-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, which constructs the VIA cells, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates segments for determining the environmental profile for the lower-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In the second embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of VIA contacts <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which connect the upper-level diagonal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and lower-level horizontal interconnect <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, is a rectangular as shown with the dotted line. The line width of the upper-level diagonal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is wider than that of the lower-level horizontal metal interconnect. For example, the line width of the upper-level diagonal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is 2<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight> times that of the lower-level metal interconnect <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Typically, diagonal interconnects in the same level is constructed parallel and having the same direction. Accordingly, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> diagonal grid surrounding of the diagonal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of interest is divided into seven segments from <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in anticlockwise rotation, and whether or not another graphics pattern exists in each segment is examined. As with the first embodiment, the environmental profile is determined using two values, 0 and 1, based on the existence of other graphics patterns. The name (cell name) of the graphics pattern to be replaced is searched from the replacement table (not shown in the figure) for the diagonal interconnect according to the determined environmental profile. The actual correction pattern is imported in the cell library (not shown in the figure) for the diagonal interconnect based on the searched name. As the result, a process, such as enlarging toward the specific direction, is applied to the edge of the diagonal interconnect <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> according to the environmental profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As with the first embodiment, in the case where the outline of the upper-level diagonal interconnect is located at the upper edge, by dividing segments in reversal direction (clockwise-rotational direction), it is possible to share the cell replacement table for the diagonal interconnect. In this case, the replaced cell is used by being mirror-reversed left to right and top to bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> FIG.<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illustrates segments <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for determining the environmental profile of the lower-level horizontal interconnect <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the horizontal interconnects in the same level also extend toward the same direction, the environmental profile is determined based on whether or not another graphics pattern exists in the divided segments in horizontal direction. The cell replacement table (not shown in the figure) for horizontal interconnects associates and stores the environmental profiles of all possible combinations and the cell names indicating the most appropriate correction shape corresponding to the environmental profiles. The actual pattern data is imported from the cell library for the horizontal interconnect according to the replacement cell name specified by the cell replacement table, and the substantive pattern correction is applied to the edge of the horizontal interconnect <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates interconnect grid points for the VIA-level sub-cell of the VIA in question. Unlike the orthogonal-system grids in the first embodiment, in the case of diagonal grids, the interconnect grid points used to examine the existence of proximate graphics patterns are the six grid points <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The environmental profile is determined by examining whether or not another graphics pattern exists in relation to these grid points, and the cell name to be replaced is specified by referencing the replacement table. The actual data of the graphics pattern corresponding to the specified cell name is imported from the cell library for the rectangular VIA, and then the correction process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The method according to the second embodiment is particularly useful for the correction of diagonal interconnects. The amount of data comprising the layout data of diagonal interconnects is generally more than that in the orthogonal system. The time and amount of processing for calculating the distance between the proximate graphics pattern and each VIA and creating the graphics pattern by correcting the design layout data with the method increases under the orthogonal system. In contrast, since OPC processing can be applied to the layout data including the diagonal interconnect in a short time with little data processing with the method of the second embodiment, the processing time until mask data creation is greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the existence of the proximate graphics pattern is examined for all of the surroundings of the respective diagonal interconnects, correction accuracy is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a diagram of an OPC pattern correction apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The pattern correction apparatus <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comprises a CPU (correction processing unit) <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>; memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>; and an input/output unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. A design pattern designed with an automated layout unit, such as CAD, is input to the pattern correction apparatus <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> via the input/output unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> stores a cell replacement table <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and a cell library <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for OPC correction. The cell replacement table <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> indexes all possible environmental profiles with the names (referred to as cell names) representing the most appropriate correction shape corresponding to each environmental profile in relation to the pattern (target cell) to be corrected and stores them. The cell library <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for OPC correction stores the actual correction pattern data indicated by the cell names in the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> comprises an environmental profile determination unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>; a replacement layout data creation unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>; and an OPC correction pattern creation unit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The environmental profile determination unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> determines the surrounding environmental profile for each sub-cell, which constructs each VIA cell. The replacement layout data creation unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> creates replacement layout data based on the environmental profile by referencing the cell replacement table <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. A replacement processing unit <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is configured by the environmental profile determination unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and replacement layout data creation unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The OPC correction pattern creation unit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> expands the cell name included in the replacement layout data into the actual graphics pattern data by referencing the cell library <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for OPC correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The mask data created in the OPC correction pattern creation unit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is output to the mask rendering unit (not shown in the figure) from the input/output unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, it may be stored in another storage area in the memory <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> or in the external storage media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> By adopting such a pattern correction apparatus, it is possible to greatly reduce the processing time in comparison with that of a pattern correction apparatus, which calculates the distance from each VIA to the proximate graphics pattern and creates the corrected graphics pattern based on the results of calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof. </paragraph>
