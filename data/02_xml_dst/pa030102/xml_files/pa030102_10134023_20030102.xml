<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method of testing the data exchange functionality of a synchronous memory which operates at a high operating clock frequency. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The functional testing of high-performance memory chips requires corresponding testing systems for the production of these memory chips. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a prior-art testing arrangement. An external testing device is connected via a control bus, a data bus and an address bus to an integrated memory chip and tests the functionality of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The external testing device addresses the memory cells to be tested within the integrated memory circuit and applies generated test patterns to the addressed memory cells via the data bus. Control signals for activating the integrated memory chip, such as read and write commands for example, are transmitted from the testing device via the control bus to the integrated memory chip. The test data written into the memory cells is subsequently read out again via the data bus and compared in the testing device with the originally generated test data, for checking the functionality of the memory cells contained in the integrated memory circuit, and evaluated. The higher the requirements imposed on the integrated memory circuits, the higher too the demands and capability of the external testing device for testing the memory chip. In many cases, no testing devices that have the required range of capabilities are available by the time production of the memory chips begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, integrated memory chips which have an inbuilt self-testing function to relieve the external testing device have been developed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a prior-art memory chip with an integrated self-testing function BIST (BIST: Built-In Self-Test). In this case, the integrated self-testing circuit is likewise connected to the external testing device via the control bus, the data bus and the address bus. The address bus is also connected to an address decoder for the addressing of the memory area contained in the memory cell array, while the data bus is additionally connected to a data input/output management, which carries out the signal adaptation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> schematically shows how the prior-art integrated memory chip represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is tested. In one test operating mode, it is decided whether the test concerned is a test of the functionality of the memory cells within the memory cell array or a test of the data exchange functionality of the entire integrated memory chip. The test of the functionality of the memory cell array is performed under the control of the inbuilt self-testing circuit, which generates the addresses of memory cells to be addressed within the memory cell array and applies them to the address decoder via the address bus. In addition, the internal self-testing circuit generates test data patterns, which are written into the addressed memory cells of the memory cell array via the internal data bus and the data input/output circuit. Subsequently, the data are read out from the addressed memory cells and evaluated by the integrated self-testing circuit with the generated test data patterns to evaluate the functionality of the memory cell array. The integrated self-testing circuit BIST subsequently informs the external testing device about the functionality of the memory cell array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a further test operating mode, the data exchange functionality of the entire integrated memory chip is tested, this being performed by the external testing device. In this case, the communication of the integrated memory chip with an external circuit is tested. For example, it is tested whether the signal connections and driver circuits of the integrated memory chip are functional and whether the memory chip is capable of communicating with external circuits. The test of the data exchange functionality of the memory chip is in this case performed under the control of the external testing device. Since modern memory chips operate at ever higher operating clock frequencies, the data exchange functionality of the integrated memory chip must likewise be carried out by the external testing device at a very high data transfer rate. The requirements imposed on the external testing device for testing the data exchange functionality of the high-performance memory chip are therefore likewise very high, so that correspondingly complex, expensive external testing devices have to be used. To some extent, highly complex testing devices of this type for the testing of high-performance memory chips are not available for testing the data exchange functionality of the memory chip in the case of new developments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object is therefore to provide a method of testing the integrated memory chip in which the data exchange functionality of the memory chip can be reliably tested with a conventional testing device which operates at a relatively low operating clock frequency and of providing an integrated synchronous memory which can be reliably tested with a conventional testing device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a testing arrangement according to the invention. A memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is connected to an external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via an address bus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Additionally connected to the address bus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a reference memory. The reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is identical in terms of circuitry to the memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. The functionality of the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, i.e. the functionality of the memory cells contained therein and the data exchange functionality of the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is ensured, for example by the previous test procedure. The memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested and the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are high-performance memory chips which operate at a very high operating clock frequency. The testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a conventional testing device which operates at a relatively low clock frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For testing the data exchange functionality of the memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, the following procedure is followed in the case of the testing arrangement <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Firstly, first test data are generated by a test-data generator within the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and are written from the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a low data transfer rate or clock frequency into memory cells of the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which are addressed by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the address bus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> emits a control command via the control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is switched by the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into a reading operating mode, and the memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched into a writing operating mode. Subsequently, the first test data are copied the high operating clock frequency at which both the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the high-performance memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested operates, via the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the memory cell array of the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into the memory cell array of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. The data are copied for example at a data transfer rate of, for example, 500 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In a further step, the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched by the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into a reading operating mode and the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is switched into a standby operating mode. The first test data, copied into the memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, are read out of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a low clock frequency by the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and subsequently compared with the originally generated first test data in the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. If the originally generated test data deviate the test data read out from the memory circuit to be tested from one another, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> detects that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If, conversely, the originally generated first test data are identical to the read-out test data, a further copying operation takes place. For this purpose, new test data or second test data are generated by the test-data generator within the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and written at the low clock frequency into the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. The memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is subsequently switched into a reading operating mode by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the written-in second test data are copied into the associated reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the high operating clock frequency. Subsequently, the reference memory is switched by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into a reading operating mode, and the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched into a standby operating mode. The copied second test data are read out from the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the low clock frequency by the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the originally generated second test data are compared by the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the copied second test data read out from the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If the originally generated second test data are identical to the copied second test data, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> detects that the memory chip to be tested is functioning faultlessly. If the originally generated second test data are not identical to the copied second test data, the testing device detects that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the procedure described, two operations for copying test data at the high operating clock frequency of the test chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested are performed, that is once from the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an operation for copying test data from the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If both copying operations are successfully concluded, so that the generated test data are identical to the copied test data, this means that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is functional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this case, the method according to the invention ensures that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tested in such a way is fully functional both with regard to the functionality of the memory cells arranged therein and with regard to a data exchange functionality. The testing arrangement according to the invention simultaneously tests the data exchange functionality of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested by the copying operations at high operating clock frequency, without the data exchange functionality having to be performed in separate further test steps after the testing of the memory cell array has been performed. As a result, the test procedure is speeded up considerably, and consequently the costs of testing are lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a further testing arrangement according to the invention, in which a plurality of memory chips to be tested are assigned to a reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The testing arrangement according to the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> offers the advantage that a plurality of memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be tested at the same time, whereby the test times can be further reduced. In this respect, there are two possibilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the case of the first possibility, each memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-N to be tested, which are assigned to a reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is tested for their functionality one after the other by two test-data copying operations following one after the other, and their evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the case of an alternative possibility, the test data are copied from the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the first memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, and from the latter to further memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-N to be tested, and subsequently evaluated by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. If the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> detects a deviation between the originally generated test data and the multiply copied test data, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> detects that one of the memory chips to be tested is defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If, after the multiple copying operation, the originally generated test data are identical to the copied test data, the copying operation is performed in the reverse sequence from one memory operation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-N to be tested to one memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-N-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> . . . and finally to the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If, even after this multiple second copying operation, the originally generated second test data are identical to the copied second test data, the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> detects that all the memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-N which are assigned to this reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are functional. The testing arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be extended in a further embodiment, by providing a plurality of reference memories <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with associated memory chips to be tested. For example, eight reference memories <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, with in each case eight assigned memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, may be provided to the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be tested at the same time in one testing stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a sequence diagram of a first embodiment of the method according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, test data are generated by the external testing device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and are written at a low clock frequency of the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into the memory cell array of the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is switched by the external testing device into a reading operating mode and the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched into a writing operating mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the first test data, written into the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, are transferred or copied via the data bus at the high operating clock frequency of, for example, 500 MHz into the memory cell array of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched into a reading operating mode and the associated reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is switched into a standby operating mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the copied first test data are read out from the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the low clock frequency by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in a step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a data comparison of the originally generated first test data and the read-out data is performed, it being detected by the test device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is defective if there is a data deviation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> If, in the converse case, the first copying operation has been successfully completed, new test data are written from the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in a step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is put into a reading operating mode and the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is switched by the testing device into a writing operating mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the second test data, written into the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are copied out of the latter at the high operating clock frequency, and consequently with a high performance, into the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is subsequently switched into a reading operating mode and the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested is switched into a standby operating mode by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the copied second test data are read out from the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the low clock frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in a step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the copied second test data are compared with the originally generated second test data by the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If the second copying operation is also successful, i.e. the copied second test data are identical to the originally generated second test data, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> establishes the functionality of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The established functionality comprises both the functionality of the memory cell array within the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested and the capability of the latter to communicate with the outside world or its data exchange functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It is consequently possible by the method according to the invention to test both the functionality of the memory cell array and the data exchange functionality in one test procedure with a conventional testing device, the clock frequency of which lies far below the operating clock frequency of the high-performance memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. In this case, given a corresponding testing arrangement, a plurality of high-performance memory chips <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be tested at the same time by a testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in one test procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the test data are copied delayed an adjustable delay time. This makes it possible to vary signal parameters of the data read in and out, for setting the specification limit values of the memory chip to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows time sequence diagrams for testing set-up times at the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. As represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the data read out from the reference memory are applied to the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested with a certain time delay through the data line. In this case, the data are preferably delayed by an adjustable delay time At corresponding to the specifications of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, in order to test critically a minimal set-up time tsmin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows time sequence diagrams for testing the holding time of the memory chip to be tested. The data read out from the reference memory are applied with a time delay &Dgr;t<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>to the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested, so that the holding time t<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is obtained. This holding time is shifted or delayed by one clock cycle by means of an adjustable delay time, so that the minimal holding time t<highlight><subscript>hmin </subscript></highlight>of the memory chip to be tested is critically tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a preferred embodiment of an integrated synchronous memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention. In the case of the preferred embodiment of the integrated synchronous memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, said memory has inbuilt self-testing circuits. In the case of the first testing arrangement represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested does not require an inbuilt self-testing circuit, but instead an external reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The synchronous memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> has an address bus connection <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a data bus connection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a control bus connection <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The address bus connection <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected to the external testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via an external address bus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The data bus connection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via an external data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the control bus connection <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to the testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via an external control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In addition, the integrated memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected at a clock-signal input connection <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a clock line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and receives an external clock signal CLK via the clock line <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The integrated memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the invention, as represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, has an internal address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for applying the address received from the testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to an internal address decoder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The address decoder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is clocked with the external clock signal CLK via an internal clock signal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and activates via lines <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the memory cells within the memory cell array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> addressed by means of the address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The integrated memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also has an internal data bus <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which exchanges via a data input/output circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which contains inter alia the read amplifiers, and lines <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the cell array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The data input/output circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is likewise clocked with the clock signal via the internal clock line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The integrated memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also contains an internal controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is connected via an internal control bus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the control bus connection <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and exchanges control signals with the external testing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The internal controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> applies control signals to memory cells <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via control lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The integrated synchronous memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> operates at a very high operating clock frequency and contains a frequency multiplying circuit for increasing the clock frequency of the applied external clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also has a first self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for testing the functionality of the memory cell array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The first self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> generates addresses of memory cells to be tested within the memory cell array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and addresses the latter via the internal address bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the address decoder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the test data are applied via the internal data bus to the data input/output circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which writes the generated test data into the addressed memory cells. Subsequently, the data are read out again from the addressed memory cells and compared with the originally generated test data by the first self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. If the generated test data are identical to the data written in and out, the internal self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> establishes the functionality of the memory cell array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and announces this to the testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via the memory bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the external testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> activates the second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the control bus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and puts the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested into a test mode. Subsequently, the testing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> switches itself into a standby operating mode and the further testing operation is controlled by the second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, test data are generated in a test generator within the integrated memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the test-data generator being located for example within the first self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for testing the data exchange functionality, activates the test-data generator and switches the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> over to reading operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in a step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the generated test data are copied under the control of the self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the test-data generator, which is located within the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a high data exchange rate, which corresponds to the high operating clock frequency of the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> switches the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> over to writing operation and the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested to data reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the test data copied in the reference memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are copied back at the high data transfer rate via the data bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the memory <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be tested. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> If the generated test data and copied-back test data deviate, the second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> detects this and generates a signal indicating that the memory chip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is defective. This indicating signal is emitted by the second self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the control bus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the external testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. One advantage here is that the two copying operations are performed under the control of the integrated self-testing circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The testing device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> merely activates the self-testing operation and receives the result of the self-testing operation. </paragraph>
