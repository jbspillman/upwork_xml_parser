<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a plastic blow molded bottle or wide mouth jar useful in containing hot-filled beverages or food products, and more particulary, the present invention relates to a container having a multi-sided sidewall which is reinforced to resist unwanted deformation, which enables a label to be aesthetically displayed on the container sidewall, and which is capable of accommodating vacuum associated with hot filling, capping and cooling of the container. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hot-fillable, blow-molded plastic containers are well known in the art. The problems associated with accommodating vacuum deformations associated with hot filling, capping and cooling, and their solutions are also well known. Typically, so-called vacuum flex panels are formed as relatively large indented panels in the sidewall of containers and accommodate the vacuum that develops in the containers as a result of hot fill processing. Examples of cylindrical containers having indented flex panels are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,762,221 issued to Tobias et al.; D.402,563 issued to Prevot et el.; D.366,831 issued to Semersky et al.; and D.366,416 issued to Semersky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hot-fillable blow-molded containers having multi-sided sidewall configurations with indented vacuum flex panels are disclosed, for example, by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,178,290 issued to Ota et al. and 5,238,129 issued to Ota. In particular, FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the Ota &apos;290 patent and FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the Ota &apos;129 patent illustrate and disclose hexagonal and octagonal container sidewall configurations which have indented flex panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hot-fillable, multi-sided containers have also been provided with a series of walls which are formed planar and which bow, flex, or warp inwardly in response to induced vacuum. Thus, the resulting shape of each panel of such hot-filled, capped and cooled containers is concave, or inwardly bowed, thereby providing the sidewall with an undulating shape in plan. Examples of such containers are disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,749,092 issued to Sugiura et al. and 4,497,855 issued to Agrawal et al. For instance, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference> of the &apos;092 Sugiura patent and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of the Agrawal &apos;855 patent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,923,178 issued to Welker, III discloses another multi-sided container having a plurality of sidewall panels which, as-formed, are planar and which are designed to flex inwardly. For instance, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of the Welker, III &apos;178 patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other related container designs are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,053 issued to Conrad which discloses an ovalized label panel for a hot-fillable bottle having a circular footprint; U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,127 issued to Weick et al. which discloses an ovalized or &ldquo;rounded-off&rdquo; rectangular sidewall of a hot-fillable bottle having front and rear outwardly bowed panels; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,244 issued to Darr which discloses a paneled sidewall of ajar having a circular footprint. Also see the container configurations disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,818,575 issued to Hirata et al.; 5,866,419 issued to Meder; D.189,372 issued to Adell; D.402,896 issued to Conrad; D.318,422 issued to Rumney; D.418,760 issued to Blank; and D.419,886 issued to Gans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A problem experienced with hot-fillable containers having flex panels, particularly indented or concave flex panels, is that voids are created within the label mounting region behind the labels. Voids behind a label can prevent the label from being prominently displayed on the container sidewall and can provide areas on the label which are prone to tearing, undesirable stretching, or the like. In addition, the use of certain labels, such as shrink wrap labels, can result in the labels extending into, or shrinking within, the voids which also negatively effects container aesthetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another problem experienced with hot-fillable containers is the occurrence of creases, dents or like deformations in the sidewalls of the containers which damage, weaken, and/or detract from the aesthetics of the container. Such deformations can result, for instance, due to line pressure experienced during transferring, filling, capping and packing operations. To this end, adjacent containers in such operations can become tightly engaged, particularly adjacent the base and lower bumper areas of the containers, thereby causing at least selected ones of the containers from being dented or provided with undesirable crease marks. More specifically, multi-sided containers typically experience such deformations adjacent the vertical post structures adjacent the base of the containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further problem relates to the occurrence of creases, dents or like deformations in the sidewalls of the containers experienced as a result of shipping and handling of the containers due to inadequate top loading or drop capability. To this end, creases or dents can result in containers located in bottom rows of containers on which many other rows of containers are stacked during shipping. In addition, forces exerted on the containers during loading and unloading of the stacked containers can also cause creases and dents. Multi-sided containers are particularly prone to such deformation along post structures adjacent the base of the containers along an area of contact of the containers with adjacent containers in the stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although various ones of the above referenced containers may function satisfactorily for their intended purposes, there is a need for a hot-fillable, blow-molded container having a flex panel and sidewall structure which permits a label to be completely wrapped around the container sidewall and prominently displayed thereon and which limits voids behind the label. In addition, preferably the sidewall structure should be multi-sided and should be reinforced to resist creasing, denting and the occurrence of like deformations. Further, the container should provide improved top loading capability and improved drop testing results. Still further, the container should be capable of efficient and relatively inexpensive manufacture and should be capable of being made from a minimum of thermoplastic material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing in mind, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a blow-molded plastic bottle and/or wide mouth jar having a multi-sided sidewall capable of accommodating induced vacuum within a hot-filled, capped and cooled container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a hot-fillable, multi-sided container providing a label mounting area which encompasses flex panel structures on the sidewall and which can prominently support and display a label, including shrink wrap labels and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A further object is to provide a hot-fillable, multi-sided, plastic, blow-molded container which provides a novel visual appearance and which has enhanced structural integrity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention provides a hot-fillable plastic container provided by a blow molded plastic container body having a circular base, a sidewall, a circular lower bumper between the base and sidewall, and a dome having an upstanding finish. The sidewall has a plurality of panels positioned circumferentially in a side-by-side relationship about the sidewall thereby forming a multi-sided sidewall structure. Each adjacent pair of panels interconnect at an obtuse angle and form a vertically-extending post structure which extends continuously through the multi-sided sidewall structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Each panel, as-formed, has a section which is arcuate in a plane extending perpendicular to an imaginary central axis extending longitudinally through the container. The arcuate sections provide the panel with a slightly outward bow and are formed having a predetermined radius of curvature within a predetermined range of radius of curvatures. Preferably, the radius of curvature of the panels varies along the length of the panels. This structure permits the arcuate sections of the panels to flex inwardly for accommodating induced vacuum created when the container is hot-filled, capped and cooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each panel also has an inset circumferentially-extending reinforcement area adjacent the lower bumper of the container. Each inset area extends between an adjacent pair of the post structures and terminates a spaced distance from the post structures to reinforce and strengthen the circular lower bumper and post structures. This structure enables the container to resist creasing, denting and like deformation, and enhances top loading capability and drop testing results.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a blow-molded plastic container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The illustrated container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is utilized to package beverages, such as juice, and is capable of being filled in either high-speed hot-fill or cold fill operations. The container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be manufactured in various sizes to provide a fill capacity of, for instance, 64 fluid ounces. Of course, the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made smaller, or larger, to provide any desired pre-determined capacity and also can be made having a wide-mouth finish so that the container can be utilized as ajar to package food products, such as, sauces, relishes, pickles, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a dome <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an upstanding finish <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The particular shape of the dome can vary as desired. In the illustrated embodiment, the dome <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a lower end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>providing an upper label bumper <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is circular and which projects outwardly directly above an inset circumferential groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides hoop strength and resists ovalization-type distortion of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the finish <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided in narrow sizes for beverage bottle-type containers and is provided in wide-mouth sizes for jar-type food containers. In addition, the finish <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be an injection molded finish or a blown finish and is preferably provided with threads for cooperatively engaging a cap (not shown) used to seal the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a closed ended base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides the container body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a circular footprint. An outer peripheral sidewall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides a lower label bumper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which, as illustrated, is circular. An endwall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be of any desired shape, such as, a concave-shaped base structure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. To this end, the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a so-called push-up style base and is capable of accommodating a percentage of the induced vacuum created in a hot-filled, capped and cooled container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One important aspect according to the present invention is that the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a multi-sided sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which extends between the dome <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the entire sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is multi-sided and provides a label mounting region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending between the upper and lower label bumpers, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, although not illustrated, only a portion of the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> need be formed as a multi-sided structure, and the label mounting region can be limited to less than the entire sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a label (not shown) can be applied to the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to cover the entire sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and extend 360&deg; about the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, the label can be a paper label adhesively applied to the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or a tubular plastic shrink wrap label shrunk to tightly engage the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Most importantly, the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of prominently displaying these and other types of labels because the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has relatively few voids, or sunken areas, behind the label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the multi-sided sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed by six panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> positioned in a side-by-side relationship about the periphery of the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each pair of adjacent panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> interconnect at an obtuse angle &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and a column, or post, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed at each interconnection. Thus, the illustrated container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has six circumferentially-spaced, longitudinally-extending posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is identical in shape and size, and only a corner-shaped post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located between each pair of adjacent panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, at least selected ones of the panels can be provided with a different shape and/or dimension, and intermediate structures can be located between each adjacent pair of panels. In addition, the number of panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> utilized to form the sidewall can vary, such as within a range of 3 to 12 panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has at least a section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereof which is flexible to accommodate induced vacuum created in a hot-filled, capped and cooled container. In accordance with the objectives of the present invention to reduce the number of voids or the like behind a label and to enhance the prominence of the display provided by the label, the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are not formed as indented structures. Rather, the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed with a slight gentle outward bow between each pair of adjacent posts <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is arcuate in a plane &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; extending perpendicular to an imaginary central axis &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is formed at a predetermined radius of curvature &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;. Also see the cross-sections of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> along planes &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; and &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, respectively, and which are formed at predetermined radius of curvatures &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is hot-filled and capped and as the hot-filled container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its contents cool, a vacuum is created which reduces the internal volume of the sealed container. The outwardly bowed sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accommodate the vacuum by flexing inwardly to a substantially flattened condition. Thus, the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the hot-filled, capped and cooled container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> maintains a uniform multi-sided configuration and is capable of prominently displaying a label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to one contemplated embodiment of the present invention, the outward bow of the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as-formed, becomes either greater, or gentler, as the panel extends in a direction parallel with the central axis &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;. For example, section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> bows outward to a greatest extent in plane &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; and flattens as the panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends upwardly toward plane &ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;. To this end, sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are flatter and have a greater radius of curvature than sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Preferably, the radius of curvature &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; defines a minimum radius of curvature of the section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the radius of curvature &ldquo;Rc<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; defines a maximum radius of curvature. In addition, preferably the minimum and maximum radius of curvatures are within 5% of one another so that the change in radius of curvature, if any, is gentle and difficult to visualize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the above discussed and illustrated structure of the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the entire flexible section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, or each entire panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, can be formed having a constant radius of curvature. Another alternative is for the sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to flatten as the sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extend in a direction toward the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Yet another alternative is a flexible section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is provided with upper and lower arcuate areas and a relatively flat intermediate area located therebetween (ie. a so-called &ldquo;H-panel&rdquo; structure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An advantage of providing a multi-sided sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which flex inwardly according to the present invention is that as the panels accommodate vacuum they are also reinforcing the post strength of the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by pinching, and preferably vertically-straightening, the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed at the interconnection of each adjacent pair of panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For instance, the obtuse angle &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the interconnection between adjacent panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as formed, reduces as the outwardly bowed flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> flatten. Thus, the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> progressively become stiffer as the sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> accommodates the induced vacuum and provides the filled and sealed container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with improved top-loading capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the multi-sided sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are continuous and without interruption thereby maximizing top-loading capability of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, preferably at least a portion of each post <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located adjacent an inset reinforcement area, or rib, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are located on each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> adjacent areas of the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that tend to crease or dent due to line pressures which are experienced during transferring, filling, capping, and packing operations and which result in adjacent containers being forced tightly together in a restricted amount of space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one circumferentially-extending rib <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is located on each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between and adjacent the lower label bumper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each rib <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends between an adjacent pair of posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and does not interrupt the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to permit the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to extend continuously from the groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the dome <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the lower label bumper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> function to reinforce and strengthen the lower label bumper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and to prevent deformation thereof. In addition, the ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> permit the arcuate flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to flatten, yet reinforce the sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from unwanted inward denting and like deformation. Thus, creasing and like deformations which structurally weaken and blemish the aesthetics of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are prevented at locations particulary susceptible to such deformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By way of example and not by way of limitation, the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manufactured of PET utilizing injection blow-molding techniques. Of course, other plastic materials and multi-layered plastic materials can be utilized as well as other blow molding techniques. The container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to have a capacity of 64 fluid ounces and a multi-sided sidewall with a total of six identical panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a flexible section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which, as formed, bows outwardly. A lower portion of the flexible section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a radius of curvature of about 5.5 inches and an upper portion of the flexible section has a radius of curvature of about 5.7 inches. The sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has six vertically extending posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has one circumferentially extending inset rib <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is located between and adjacent the lower label bumper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the flexible sections <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Each rib <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> terminates a spaced distance from an adjacent pair of posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and preferably the innermost walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the ribs <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are planar as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and have ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which interconnect to form a portion of the posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, preferably the upper and lower label bumpers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are circular in plan and the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the container body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a circular footprint. Finally, each panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has three longitudinally-spaced, circumferentially extending inset reinforcement ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which prevent unwanted over flexure of the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and assures that the panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> uniformly accommodates the induced vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> While a preferred hot-fillable container body having a multi-sided sidewall has been described in detail, various modifications, alterations and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
