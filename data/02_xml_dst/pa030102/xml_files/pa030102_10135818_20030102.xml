<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to a network apparatus capable of automatically configuring connection polarities, and in particular to a network apparatus capable of automatically configuring polarities in a 10Base-T, 100Base-T and 1000Base-T network. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a typical local area network, a parallel cable or crossover cable is generally used to interconnect a number of network apparatuses, for example, hubs, switches, repeaters or network cards, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if it is desirous to interconnect two network interface cards (NIC) crisscross, a crossover cable must be employed to allow the transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a network interface card to respectively connect to the receiver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of another network interface card, so as to form a valid network connection. On the other hand, if it is desirous to connect a network interface card to a switch, a parallel cable must be employed to assure the validity of connection polarities. If it is desirous to interconnect network apparatuses, one has to choose proper network cable to bring them to a correct connection polarity. However, it is quite a torment to a network user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, if two network apparatuses in a local area network need to be interconnected crisscross, that is, the polarities of the transmit pair and the receive pair are needed to be exchanged, it is generally accomplished by a manual MDIX (medium-dependent interface crossover) switch. It indicates the manual switching of the transmission/reception polarity on the connector can be achieved by a user to manually push a button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If two network apparatuses are of different data transmission rates, for instance, those in 10Base-T (10 MHz), 100Base-T (100 MHz) and 1000Base-T (GHz) networks that transmits data with different data transmission rates, it is unlikely to automatically configure connection polarities through the use of prior connection polarity configuration technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Besides, the so-called auto-negotiation capability enables different interconnected network apparatuses to work under an optimized operating mode, including full-duplex, half-duplex and so on. However, if the network apparatuses are interconnected with incorrect polarity, it is unable to bring the auto-negotiation mechanism into full play. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a major object of the present invention to provide a universal network apparatus capable of automatically configuring connection polarities in a network and the operating method thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention discloses a network apparatus capable of automatically configuring connection polarities in a network. The network apparatus can be a switch or hub, and including a plural order random number generator for generating a plurality of random numbers, a plurality of connectors each of which is connected to a corresponding network cable, wherein each connector includes a signal detector for detecting a signal, for example, a normal link pulse or a fast link pulse from the corresponding network cable, and a polarity configurer coupled between the signal detector and the random number generator for selectively changing a connection polarity of a connector thereof in accordance with one of the random numbers generated by the random number generator when no signal is detected by the signal detector from the corresponding network cable. The signal detector further includes a status counter for counting a first predetermined time period to determine the connection polarity of the corresponding network cable, and counting a second predetermined time period to allow the auto-negotiation process to be completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The first predetermined time period is preferably set at 62 milliseconds and the second predetermined time period is preferably set at 1.8 seconds. The network apparatus is applicable to a 10Base-T, 100Base-T and 1000Base-T network simultaneously and is provided with auto-negotiation capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention also addresses a method of automatically configuring a connection polarity for a network apparatus, including the following steps of enabling the network apparatus to operate in either a medium-dependent interface test mode or a medium-dependent interface crossover test mode, detecting a network signal within a first time period, selectively enabling the network apparatus to operate in either the medium-dependent interface test mode or the medium-dependent interface crossover test mode in accordance with a random number if failing to detect a network signal within the first time period, and enabling the network apparatus to stay at a stable state for at least a second time period if a network signal is detected or a link is established within the first time period, wherein if a network signal is continuously detected or a link is established, enabling the network apparatus to keep staying at the stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Now the foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood through the following descriptions with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In general, a network apparatus such as switch or hub is provided with a plurality of connectors, and each of the connectors is provided with a network interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> network apparatus capable of automatically configuring connection polarities in a network according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a MDI(media dependent interface) enabling network interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as a RJ-45 connector that is used to connect to a network cable. The network apparatus of the present invention further includes a signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is coupled to the output of the MDI enabling network interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for detecting a network signal from the network cable to determine whether the transmitted data is valid, that is, to check whether there is data received. The signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further can be used to determine the data transmission rate over the network cable, for example, 10 MHz or 100 MHz. If the transmitted data is valid, the way of data transmission remains unchanged. Otherwise, a random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will generate a random number and output the random number to a polarity configurer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The polarity configurer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> selectively provides control signals for the MDI enabling network interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to switch its connection polarity according to the random number from the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the random number from the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used to determine whether the assignment of the TX(transmission)/RX(reception) pins of the MDI enabling network interface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is to remain unchanged or to be switched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, the operation algorithm of the network apparatus of the present invention can be better illustrated from the point of view of a state machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a state diagram illustrating the operation algorithm of an internal MDI/MDIX state machine of the network apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this preferred embodiment, it is inclined to take a network apparatus applicable to a 10Base-T, a 100Base-T and a 1000Base-T network and is provided with auto-negotiation capability as an example for illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the network apparatus resets or powers on, the operation flow of the network apparatus initiates from block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>), that is, the network apparatus operates in MDI test mode. In state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the status counter of the signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> starts to count, and the operation of the network apparatus will stay at the same state for at least a first predetermined time period through the circulative execution of the loop <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the first predetermined time period is set at 62 milliseconds (which is conformable to the link period prescription in IEEE standard 802.3). The signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> continuously detects a network signal, or detects a link pulse, for example, a normal link pulse or a fast link pulse. If the status counter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> reaches the first predetermined time period, and no network signal is detected or no link is established, the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> generates a random number to determine whether the operation of the network apparatus stays at state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> or goes to state S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, if the signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects a network signal or a link is established within the first predetermined time period, it indicates that the current connection configuration is correct, namely, the network apparatus operates in MDI mode, the operation of the network apparatus will go to block <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (state S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) via path <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which indicates the network apparatus operates in a stable state of MDI mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In state S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation of the network apparatus will stay at the same state for at least a second predetermined time period, preferably 1.8 seconds (which is the time period required to complete the auto-negotiation process). If data is continuously received or a link is established, it indicates the network apparatus operates in a stable state of MDI mode and its operation is normal, and the operation of the network apparatus keeps staying at state S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the circulative execution of loop <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to repeat the MDI test mode operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if no data is received or no link is established within the second predetermined time period in state S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation of the network apparatus returns back to state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>This situation could occur if the link is down or the other side network apparatus is changed or the other side network apparatus fails to transmit data over a period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, in state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> if no network signal is detected or no link is established, the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> generates a random number. The intention of using the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is to prevent two universal MDI/MDIX enabling network interfaces that change their polarities simultaneously all the time but can not identify each other from failing to link. While the random number determines the operation of the network apparatus to go to block <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, that is, state S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it indicates that the network apparatus operates in MDIX test mode. In state S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the status counter is reset and the operation of the network apparatus stays at state S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for at least a first predetermined time period, more preferably 62 milliseconds (which is conformable to the link period prescription in IEEE standard 802.3). The signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> continuously detects a network signal or detects whether a link is established. If the status counter reaches the first predetermined time period, and no network signal is received or no link is established, the random number generator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> generates a random number to determine whether the operation of the network apparatus stays at state S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or goes back to state S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, if the signal detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects a network signal or a link is established within the first predetermined time period, it indicates that the current connection configuration is correct, namely, the network apparatus operates in MDIX mode, the operation of the network apparatus will go to block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (state S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) via path <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which indicates the network apparatus operates in a stable state of MDIX mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In state S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the network apparatus stays at state S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for at least a second predetermined time period, more preferable 1.8 seconds. If data is continuously received or a link is established within the second predetermined time period, it indicates that the network apparatus stays at MDIX stable state and the operation is normal, and the operation of the network apparatus keeps staying at state S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the circulative execution of loop <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to repeat the MDIX test mode operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For example, the foregoing random number variable can be one of thirteenth order, in which the thirteen nodes thereof is capable of generating sufficient random numbers. As far as a switch or a hub having a plurality of connectors is concerned, the automatic connection polarity configuration technique of the present invention is quite convenient for the assurance of connection polarity. From the point of view of hardware implementation, only a random number generator is necessary to be shared by a plurality of connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be summarized by a network apparatus capable of automatically configuring connection polarities to transmit and receive network signals in a network, including a random number generator of a plural order for generating a plurality of random numbers, and a plurality of connectors each of which is connected to a corresponding network cable. Each of the connectors includes a signal detector for detecting a network signal on the corresponding network cable, for example, a fast link pulse or a normal link pulse, and a polarity configurer coupled between the signal detector and the random number generator for selectively changing a connection polarity of a connector thereof in accordance with one of the random numbers generated by the random number generator when the signal detector fails to detect a network signal from the corresponding network cable. The signal detector further includes a status counter for counting a first predetermined time period for determining a connection polarity of the corresponding network cable and counting a second predetermined time period for allowing the auto-negotiation process to be completed. The first predetermined time period is preferably set at 62 milliseconds and the second predetermined time period is preferably set at 1.8 seconds. The network apparatus can be applicable to a 10Base-T, 100Base-T and 1000Base-T network simultaneously and is provided with auto-negotiation capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention also suggests a method of configuring a connection polarity for a network apparatus, including the following procedural steps of: enabling the network apparatus to operate in either a MDI test mode or a MDIX test mode, detecting a network signal within a first time period, selectively enabling the network apparatus to operate in either MDI test mode or MDIX test mode in accordance with a random number if failing to detect a network signal within the first time period, and if a network signal is detected or a link is established within the first time period, enabling the network apparatus to stay at a stable state for at least a second time period, wherein if a network signal is continuously detected or a link is established, enabling said network apparatus to keep staying at the stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the foregoing is intended to give a preferred embodiment of the present invention only, but is not used to be taken as an exhaustive disclosure of the present invention. Those of skill in the art will soon recognize that these and other modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
