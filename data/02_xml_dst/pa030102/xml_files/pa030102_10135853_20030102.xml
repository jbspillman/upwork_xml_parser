<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a lottery game, and more particularly, to a lottery game and system that is accessible online, is played only when predetermined participation related conditions are satisfied and has a tiered or pyramid-like distribution method for distributing jackpots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the advent of the globally accessible networks, such as the Internet, and the popularity of lottery games, there have been attempts to provide lottery type games that are accessible and playable on the Internet. Most of the on-line lottery games known comprise versions that either access or resemble existing state lotteries. The games known primarily award the main prize to participants that match all the numbers drawn and smaller prizes to participants have some but not all of the drawn numbers. In addition, the current lottery systems known offer extremely poor odds of winning the main jackpot because of the number of matches that are required to win. As a result, on-line lotteries and existing state lotteries are losing popularity and, in some instances, struggling. The gaming systems known in the art are profiled herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,278, issued to Markowicz, discloses a network of individual lottery systems such as state lotteries, interconnected such that players can participate in a national lottery. Each of the state lotteries operate independently using data entry and validation stations for accepting player data and having independent structure for selecting individual winners based upon coincidence of player-selected data and random data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,035, issued to Morris, et al., discloses a gaming system including a central game processor, a plurality of master processing units and a plurality of slave terminals operable by players to select and play the games from a pool of games. The central game processor communicates with the master processing units and supplies the various games available in the system. The system provides video lottery plays and updates players on their chances of purchasing one of the remaining winning plays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,904,619, issued to Scagnelli, et al., discloses a wagering system for accepting wagers over communications systems comprising an automatic call director means (ACD) for receiving incoming messages from subscribers who wish to wager on the system; message means (wagering VRU) connected thereto for receiving the incoming messages routed from the ACD, and for playing a series of recorded audio messages requesting subscriber wager information to be input via telecommunications means; and host processor means having storage means and being connected to the wagering VRU for receiving the subscriber wager information, storing it in a master subscriber wager file in the storage means, and assigning an associated ticket number to the wager. The system allows players to play conventional lottery games via a telecommunication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,272, issued to Walker et al., discloses a conditional lottery ticket system that processes conditional lottery ticket transactions, including the acceptance and validation of play entries, that does not activate purchased lottery tickets until one or more player defined activation conditions are satisfied, such as a minimum jackpot, particular date or external event. An external event could be based on a subscription. The conditional lottery ticket system preferably includes a central lottery server and one or more remote lottery terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> PCT Patent No. WO 96/00950, issued to Walker, discloses a remote gaming system whereby a player can gamble against a wagering establishment or state-run lottery from a remote location on a personal or portable computer device where it is unnecessary to establish an on-line connection with a host computer associated with the wagering establishment. The gaming computer has software for providing a wagering opportunity and enabling the player to obtain gambling credit and cash-out any winnings. The host computer enables the player to purchase and redeem gambling credit at a remote location using cryptographic protocols through a series of authenticatable message exchanges between the player and the establishment, the gaming computer and the host computer directly on-line, or the gaming computer and a detachable tamper-resistant credit module with preloaded gambling credit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As the above noted art fails to provide a lottery system and game that is accessible and playable on-line, offers jackpot winnings at much more favorable odds, distribute jackpot to persons matching most numbers in a pyramid-like format, there exist a need for a gaming system that fills this gap in the prior art. The instant invention solves this problem by providing such a game and system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Based on the foregoing, it is a primary object of the instant invention to provide a globally accessible lottery-based system and game that provides improved odds for winning, a tiered system for awarding the jackpot, and a fixed number of plays per game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the instant invention to provide a globally accessible lottery-based system and game that manages the collection, allocation, protection and dispersion of funds through secured communication links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In light of these and other objects, the instant invention provides a globally accessible offshore lottery game comprised of software and the steps of selecting a plurality of numbers from a defined set, such as 1 to 53, comparing the player&equals;s numbers to a United States lottery drawing (such as Florida) and distributing a predetermined jackpot, such as one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), to all winners having the most numbers that match the state lottery numbers. For instance, if no players get all six numbers, but say four players match five numbers, then the four players would split the jackpot. The winners are determined by the player or players that match the most numbers, even if it is a hundred players that match one number and no one else matches any. If no tickets match any of the numbers, then the purse is used for the next drawing and the players that play again receive a discount on their next ticket, such as 50%. The money is always distributed unless no one matches any of the numbers. The game is not played until a certain number of tickets are sold. If more than the designated numbers of tickets are sold, then the extra tickets are applied to the next drawing. Based on the teachings of the invention, the jackpot is conveniently manageable and predictable, the host realizes guaranteed revenue, players have an improved chance of winning the jackpot even if they do not match all numbers, cash never exchanges hands, the system is able to distribute winnings automatically and players can play from any remote location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these and other objects, which will become apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C depict the preferred and alternative embodiments of the globally accessible lottery game and system of the instant invention, which is generally characterized by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system of the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made available on a globally accessible network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a plurality of databases <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, user accounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a central computer or central processing unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and software <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that is readable and processible by the processing unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for controlling the access and content in the databases <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and financial accounts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The instant invention further comprises the software <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> apart from the system, the method of processing and/or the method of playing the on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Players wishing to access, use and/or play the on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably access the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through a globally accessible network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a locally accessible network or direct link <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably includes a fire wall or other secured connection to provide secure communications when receiving and/or providing data. The lottery numbers database <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives and stores the winning lottery numbers for various state run lotteries. The games database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> receives and stores a plurality of games which may be selected and played by members and registrants with the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The players database <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> receives and stores information pertaining to registered players and players having memberships to play at least one game. Membership database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives and stores registrant membership information on all players having current memberships with the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that databases <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may comprise a single database partitioned for storing the respective information noted herein in a plurality of partitions or two or more databases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the links between the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and/or escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a secured and direct link so as to alleviate or eliminate the interception of transferred information. The communication links denoted by two solid lines preferably comprise telecommunications links having sufficient band width for transmitting data comprising financial account-related information and monetary wire transfers. Although the communication links denote communication between fields, such as between host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the communication link does not necessarily include access to all information in the programs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or databases <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For instance, although the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is linked to the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, users visiting the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> do not have access to the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise links to a user&apos;s account <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for receiving payment for tickets and transferring winnings into the user&apos;s account, but it preferably does not provide direct access to the user&apos;s account information and cannot receive funds from the user account <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> unless authorization has been given. The communication links denoted by two phantom lines comprise optional links. For instance, the escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably linked to the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> but it may be linked to the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for directly transmitting jackpot funds into the escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be linked to the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to more directly controlling the transfer of funds from the merchant account to the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the communication links <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may, but do not necessarily have to, be direct and line links. The links may comprise a wired or wireless system, such as a Packet Switching Network (PSN) or any packet, cell or similar network in which data compiled, partitioned, and/or transmitted in packet-like units. In a wireless system, the invention may also employ Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) technology or other known wireless publicly accessible communication technology. The links between the data bases <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and host website and cpu/software and server system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> denote conventional links as is known in the art. The links shown between the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and globally accessible network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and direct link <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> denote conventional network links such as that provided by modems, DSL and wireless systems having compatible bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention includes accounts for managing funds. The merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably linked to the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or CPU/software system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through secured links. At least one account out of the three is necessary for managing the receipt of funds and the distribution of winnings. A single host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be arranged to electronically receive payment for tickets, disburse payment to the host company and disburse the jackpot to winners. In order to avoid complications that may arise from managing funds through a single account, the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably employs a plurality of accounts, such as those depicted by characters <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For instance, the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be used to receive the payments for lottery tickets and to act as a liaison for transferring money from the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and if used, user accounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. That is, a user account <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be directly linkable to the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that funds may be directly transferred into the host account for authorizing payment and tickets. In the preferred embodiment, when a user registers with the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> funds are initially received by the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and distributed to the merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, respectively. Alternatively, the initial funds may be received through a merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is initially set up through the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In either arrangement, a predetermined percentage of the funds received are held in the host account for covering the costs of the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while a predetermined percentage of the funds are transferred to an escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for disbursement to players that win the jackpot. The CPU/software and server system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may manage the allocation of funds between the various accounts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an example of the preferred website pages and links is shown. When the host website address is accessed through a globally accessible network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the home page of the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first made available. While other pages may be accessed first based on the website address accessed through the Internet, in one embodiment it is preferred that all Internet traffic be directed through the home page <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for security reasons. The host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a home page <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a registration page <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a contact information page <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, a rules and regulations page <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a membership page <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;play the game&rdquo; page <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. The registration, contact, rules and regulations, membership, and game pages <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are preferably linked to the home page <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> such that all pages are accessible from the home page <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In addition to providing links to the other pages on the website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as linked to other websites on the Internet, the home page may provide general information on the lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as general information regarding the method in which the game is played, odds of winning, benefits derived from directing traffic to the website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and other information to encourage registrations and participation. Registration page <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> requests and obtains information from visitors wishing to register with the on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The registration page, therefore, has a plurality of fields for receiving and processing registrant information, such as name, address, zip code and e-mail address, as depicted by block <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The registration information obtained from the registration page <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> allows the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to update information related to the lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, future games and any other information of interest. The rules and regulations page <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> provides the ability to read <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> the rules and regulations governing the lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an &ldquo;I accept button&rdquo; <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that contractually binds registrants and members with regard to the game and its rules <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the registration page also allows the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to entice registrants to become members and/or to refer traffic to the site in exchange for potentially receiving a percentage of a jackpot if any referral should win. The membership page <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> confirms registrant information and contractually establishes membership with the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A registrant must become a member to play the lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Membership is approved in block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In order to play the game, the &ldquo;play the game page&rdquo; <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is accessed and activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the instant invention communicates with visitors, registrants and members using e-mail addresses. In order to participate in the on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the instant invention a user must have an internet address. The host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> uses e-mail addresses to communicate with registrants and members. This information may include new games, next drawing, winning numbers, membership related information and notification of winnings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Prior to participating in a lottery game in accordance with the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a player must first obtain a membership and register with the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the registration process, the user is required to provide credit card and/or wire transfer information for making payment towards lottery tickets and receiving winnings. This is preferably achieved through a globally accessible network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as the Internet, but may also be achieved through a direct telecommunication link or locally accessible network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Once a player registers with the host website <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a member, that information is stored in the membership database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each time a player pays and participates in a game, that information is stored in a player&apos;s database <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of games, such as those dictated by the lottery drawings in various states. The instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably uses the lottery numbers drawn from various state lotteries to allow verification of winning numbers and legitimacy of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The game of the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an on-line lottery where participants purchase tickets and pick numbers from a predetermined set, such as 1 to 53, with the hopes of matching the lottery numbers from a predetermined lottery drawing. Instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably only sells a certain number of tickets before each drawing, such as 80,000 tickets such that there must be and would only be 80,000 tickets sold for each and every lottery. The winning numbers maybe tied to the U.S. Florida lottery drawn on Saturdays or Wednesdays, or some other predetermined state lottery. A predetermined jackpot will be set for each lottery, which is preferably $1,000,000 in a preferred embodiment. The jackpot is divided among the players that correctly picked the most numbers from the corresponding state lottery. This makes for a tamper proof lottery. If, however, no one picks all six numbers, then the winners will be determined by the participants picking the most correct numbers. For instance, if no one picks six of six numbers, then the $1,000,000.00 jackpot would be divided among those with five of six numbers. If no one picks five of six numbers, then the jackpot is divided among those selecting four of the six numbers. If no one picks four of six numbers, then the jackpot is divided among those that selected three of the six numbers. If no one picks three of the six numbers, then the jackpot is divided among those with two of six numbers. If no one picks two of six numbers, then the jackpot is divided among those with one of six numbers. If no one picks any of the numbers correctly, then the $1,000,000.00 is either held until the next drawing or used to provide the participants with a discount, such as 50%, or credit towards the purchase of their next lottery ticket(s). For instance, if each lottery ticket sells for $25.00 and 80,000 tickets are sold, then the $1,000,000.00 jackpot would be comprised of half the lottery ticket price, i.e., $12.50. Consequently, if no one wins that drawing, then a $12.50 credit will be issued to each player for purchasing future tickets. Depending on the number of participants that take advantage of the credit, the next jackpot drawing would still not be done until 80,000 tickets or some other predetermined number of tickets have been sold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Unlike the Florida lottery which has no jackpot winners (&ldquo;jackpot&rdquo; meaning the main prize) if six numbers are not correctly picked, then the prize rolls over to the next drawing, there will always be a winner for the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the instant invention once the minimum number of tickets have been sold. Consequently, there is a greater chance of winning the jackpot or a portion thereof because all six numbers do not have to be picked correctly in order to win. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, the method and system for processing participants is shown. The method in system <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> processing participants preferably comprises establishing membership, registering to play, selecting a game, drawing numbers and paying. The invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a registration process and/or membership process to offer more flexible services, such as allowing those who do not want to play as a member but want to refer new members so they can win if the new member wins as further described here. To initiate processing, a user first logs in and verifies whether they are a new or previous visitor. If the visitor is new user, i.e. not a registrant or member, the visitor is queried for information pertaining to establishing a new account, such as name, address, e-mail address and bank account information <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The program verifies the accuracy and solvency of the visitor&apos;s account <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Upon verifying the accuracy of the information submitted, a membership is established and the new member is authorized to participate in the on-line lottery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Prior to playing, a member may access game-related information <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, such as the number of tickets remaining for the next drawing <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, rules and odds of winning <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, information on prior winners <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and various links to other sites <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Upon reviewing such information, the member is given the option of playing <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. If the member opts not to play, then they may log out or continue reviewing information pertaining to the game <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. A member may also directly play upon logging in <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the member may need to register to play the next game <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. All information pertaining to the member for the next drawing is stored in the database, preferably the players per game database <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or the membership database <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The on-line lottery game <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise one lottery game or a plurality of lottery games from which a member can select to play. In the embodiment comprising multiple games, the member must select a game to play <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The available games may be based on select state lottery drawings <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, numbers taken and combined from multiple state lotteries <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> or on other numbers readily verifiable <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> After selecting a game, the member draws or selects its lottery numbers for the play ticket <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. Numbers may be randomly selected using a random number generator <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> or personally selected <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The lottery ticket is not issued until the predetermined number of numbers are selected. The lottery tickets preferably comprise six numbers in a predetermined range, such as 1 through 53. It should be noted that the number of play numbers per ticket and number range may vary without departing from the scope and spirit of the instant invention. Once a valid ticket has been completed, the ticket information is stored in a database, preferably in the players per game database <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Upon completing a ticket selection, the member is offered the opportunity to purchase additional tickets <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. If the member elects to purchase additional tickets, then the program is redirected to the subroutine or program object for selecting games <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that in an alternative embodiment multiple tickets maybe purchased at one time. Members are given the option of playing multiple games and/or purchasing multiple tickets. Once the member elects not to purchase any more tickets, the lottery ticket order is confirmed and finalized <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Upon finalizing the order, the member is given the total amount due and must authorize payment from a previously approved credit card or bank account providing wire transfer abilities <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. When a member purchases a lottery ticket for a drawing that does not yield any winners, their account is credited with approximately fifty percent (50%) of the purchase price for each ticket purchased for that drawing for use with future lottery ticket purchases. Accordingly, the processing program applies player discounts to future lottery ticket purchase <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. The credit may be applied before or after finalizing an order. Once the full purchase price, including credits, have been confirmed, funds are drawn from the user&apos;s account <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. This is preferably done by a direct wire transfer from the member&apos;s bank account or applying the charge to the member&apos;s credit card account. The program verifies and confirms whether funds have cleared once processed. If the funds do not clear, then the member is notified and must be reprocessed <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Once the funds have cleared, the member&apos;s lottery tickets are cleared and activated and the member&apos;s account is charged <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Payment for lottery tickets are allocated into the escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at predetermined percentages. In the preferred embodiment, approximately fifty percent (50%) of the ticket purchase price is held in an escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and approximately 50% of the purchase price is held in the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, money for ticket purchases are initially deposited into the host website&apos;s merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in block <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Once the funds clear, the money is taken from the merchant account <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and deposited into the host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> based on predetermined allocation percentages. The escrow account <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably holds funds comprising the jackpot. The host account <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holds funds that go to the host website owner for covering costs and profit margins, as shown in block <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. Thereafter or some time before, the database of players per game <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is updated with information on new players and their ticket purchases <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each time a new ticket entry is made into the database for players per game <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a ticket counter is incremented by the number of new tickets <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>. The number of tickets sold for each game are continuously monitored so as to determine when the ticket threshold has been reached <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. If the number of tickets sold does not meet the threshold level, then the game is postponed until the requisite number of tickets have been sold <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. Once the required number of tickets have been sold, no more ticket purchases will be applied to the next drawing and the next drawing is then announced at least one (1) day before the lottery drawing. In order to insure security and alleviate potential tampering, tickets are preferably not sold one hour before and one hour after the corresponding state lottery drawing. As only a limited number of tickets are sold per game, once the ticket threshold has been reached, then any new ticket purchases will be applied to the following lottery drawing. Upon determining the lottery drawing date, all members who purchase tickets for the lottery drawing are given notice of the drawing date, preferably by electronic mail. Thereafter, the processing program <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> directs the user to start <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, homepage <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> or a display of other tickets sold and/or available for the next drawing <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a game or games may be provided in which the lottery drawing is made at predetermined intervals, such as once a month or week, and the corresponding jackpot comprises half or approximately half of the finds received for the that jackpot. Players may elect to play either game, that is the one based on a fixed number of ticket purchases or the one based on time intervals. Players may further have the option to chose from a variety of games that differ in ticket price and jackpot, and/or differ in the timing of the drawing and determination of the jackpot as noted above. For instance, a ticket for $25.00 could correspond to a $1,000,000 jackpot, a $50.00 ticket could correspond to a $2,000,000 jackpot, a $100.00 ticket could correspond to a $4,000,000 jackpot and so on. These jackpots would be based on a fixed ticket sale requirement, such as 80,000 tickets. These games could also be played in accordance with the alternative embodiment wherein drawings are done at specified times and the jackpot varies based on the number of tickets sold and is preferably approximately half of the ticket revenue for that drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the software comprising the game and distribution of winnings <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown. Once the required number of lottery tickets are sold, the game playing routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> confirms and activates the game to be played on the designated date <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The game playing routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also verify the players registered for the next drawing <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The game playing software <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also store and lock the playing tickets electronically to insure security. In those embodiments having multiple games available, the game playing routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> would access the game database to find the game selected for play. If the lottery drawing is going to be based on a select state lottery, such as Florida, then the routine looks for that state lottery in the database <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> tracks the state lottery and obtains and stores the winning numbers in the database of state lottery winning numbers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, if the game to be played is based on a number of lotteries or other predetermined numbers, then the routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> accesses the information related to those numbers, tracking the state lotteries, and obtaining and storing the lottery numbers in the database <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The numbers drawn from multiple state lotteries are organized into the winning number for determining the winning number <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Once the winning numbers have been determined from the selected game, the game routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> accesses the database of issued tickets <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The purchased tickets are compared to the winning numbers <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The game routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> first determines whether any of the issued tickets matched all six numbers. If a ticket matches all six numbers, then the routine confirms the winning ticket, divides the winnings if there are multiple winning tickets, confirms and notifies the winners, confirms the winner&apos;s account and wires the winnings from the escrow account database <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the winning member&apos;s account <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. If, however, no tickets match all six numbers then the game routine <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> looks for tickets which match five of six numbers <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. If no ticket has matches five of six numbers, then the game routine looks for four of six numbers and then three of six and then two of six and then one of six <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. If no numbers match, then the participants are given a 50% discount on next ticket purchase, which may come from the escrow account or host account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the alternative embodiment, the instant invention may also comprise a secondary method of winning which is based on the primary method of winning. That is, a first non-participant, which is preferably but not necessarily a registrant, identifies and conveys or communicates to a second non-participant the host address of the instant invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second non-participant accesses the website and successfully completes registration and/or membership procedures in accordance with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and provides the address of the first non-participant. The first non-participant is then converted to a new participant and/or registrant if not already registered. If the new registrant or participant wins a drawing, then the first non-participant who directed the new registrant receives a predetermined percentage of the jackpot, such as ten percent, which preferably comes from the host account funds and not the jackpot finds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The instant invention has been shown and described herein in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention and that obvious structural and/or functional modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
