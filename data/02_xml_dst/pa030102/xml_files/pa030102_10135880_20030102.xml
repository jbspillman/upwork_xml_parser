No. 09/467,617, filed on Dec. 20, 1999, entitled &ldquo;REDUNDANT ELECTRICAL FUSES&rdquo;. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/467,617 is commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The disclosure of the related patent application is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fuses in integrated circuits and, in particular, to multiple electric fuses for redundancy. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fuses are devices extensively used in integrated circuits to provide a way to program, repair, or modify the operation of, an integrated circuit after the circuit has been manufactured. Typical applications for semiconductor fuses include programmability of memory (PROM, EPROM) and disablement/enablement of certain circuitry for redundancy purposes (memories), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The two main types of fuses in common use by the semiconductor industry are electric fuses and optical fuses. Optical fuses are blown (or open-circuited) using radiation (such as laser) while electric fuses are blown by an electric current flowing through the electric fuse. In many applications, electric fuses are preferred over optical fuses due to the complexity and time needed to blow optical fuses using radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One problem that exists with electric fuses is that sometimes after an electric fuse is blown, the fuses can reform upon cooling or sometime thereafter. While additional and complex testing may detect such a defect, it is generally desirable to blow the fuse(s) and perform no additional testing (in most cases, the testing has already been performed prior to the blowing of the fuses). In addition, even though duplication of the step of blowing the fuse may sometimes bring success in re-blowing a fuse that has reformed immediately, there is still a substantial possibility that the fuse may reform again after packaging of the die or during use in the field. If this occurs, the integrated circuit will be (or become) defective and cannot be repaired, thereby reducing the yield or affecting the IC during customer operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need to increase the yield of integrated circuits (and decrease the likelihood of failure in the field) that utilize electric fuses therein by reducing the likelihood that a reformed electric fuse (reformed after blowing) will cause a fatal defect. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>, discussed herein, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present invention in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present invention may be implemented in any suitably arranged integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic diagram a fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a fuse control device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One end of the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and one terminal of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are coupled to a node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, while the other end of the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, one end of the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and one terminal of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are coupled to a node <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Another terminal of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is coupled to a first voltage reference VREF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the control terminal coupled to a fuse control signal FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the other endo f the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is coupled to a second voltage reference VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Another terminal of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is coupled to a third voltage reference VREF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the control terminal coupled to a fuse control signal FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are electric fuses of the type that are blown when a predetermined amount of current flows through the fuse. The fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are constructed of a conductive material, such as polysilicon. In a preferred embodiment, the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are constructed of doped polysilicon that is unsalicided. Additionally, the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> each have a resistance and a power dissipation per unit cross section area (or current density) (and assuming height (or thickness) is constant) associated therewith depending on geometry and composition of the fuse. In a preferred embodiment, the power dissipation per unit cross section area of the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is greater than the power dissipation per unit cross section area of the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and preferably about two times or more greater. As will be appreciated, and assuming a substantially same composition and same thickness of conductive material for both fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in order to achieve a larger power dissipation per unit cross section area for the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shaped such that it is more narrow (and with the same length) than the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the thickness and length are the same for the two fuses, then a smaller width provides a greater power dissipation per unit cross section area. It will be understood that one of ordinary skill in the rt can easily select a composition and shape (length, height, and width) of th fuses to achieve the desired result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the one embodiment, the fuse control devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and MOS transistors, and in a preferred embodiment, the devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are n-channel devices and the second voltage reference (VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is Vdd (or power) while the first and third reference voltages (VREF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VREF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) are both ground. As will be appreciated, the first and third reference voltages do not have to be at the same voltage reference, provided the voltage values are sufficient to provide a current flowing between the second reference voltage (VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the first voltage reference (VREF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) (flowing through the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) when the fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is turned &lsquo;on&rsquo;, and to provide a current flowing between the second reference voltage (VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the third voltage reference (VREF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) (flowing through the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) when the fuse control device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is turned &lsquo;on&rsquo;. It will be understood that the fuse control devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are relatively large transistors having a substantial W/L ratio adequate to allow a sufficient current to flow through the fuses in order to blow the fuses. It will also be understood that the fuse control devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may alternatively be p-channel MOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The basic operation of blowing the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will now be described (assuming VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is power and VREF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and VREF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are both ground). The fuse control signal FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is activated thereby turning on the fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and generating a current flowing through both the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> sufficient to blow (open circuit) the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Due to the higher power dissipation per unit cross section area of the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will incur higher power dissipation (get hotter) than the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and will blow first. As will be appreciated, the period of time needed for blowing use <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will depend mainly upon the composition and geometry of the fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the voltage differential between VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VREF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the size of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> After fuse <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is blown, the fuse control signal FC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is activated thereby turning on the fuse control device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and generating a current flowing through the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> sufficient to blow the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (open circuit). As will be appreciated, the period of time needed for blowing fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will depend mainly upon the composition and geometry of the fuse <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the voltage differential between VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and VREF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the size of the fuse control device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Having a redundant fuse system in accordance with the present invention increases the yield of integrated circuits that utilize fuses to repair or modify circuitry (e.g., redundant rows or columns in memory). It will be understood that if a fuse itself is inoperable or defective due to failure to blow (i.e., reformed after blowing), then an integrated circuit that would normally be operational if the fuse operated as desired will be defective. The present invention decreases the probability that a defective fuse will cause a fatal defect in an integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in conjunction with a fuse latch circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The fuse latch circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> generates an output signal (OUTPUT) having a first state when one or both of the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are blown (open-circuited) and having a second state when none of the fuses <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are blown. The fuse latch circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown is only one embodiment of a fuse latch circuit that may be utilized with the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that many configurations of latch circuits may be utilized as long as the desired results are achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fuse latch circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a p-channel MOS transistor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> coupled to the node (OUT) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, two n-channel MOS transistors, and an inverter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, all configured as shown. An initialize signal (INIT) is coupled to the gate (control) terminals of the transistors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The INIT signal is a pulsed signal that latches in the state of the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (state one&mdash;at least one fuse blown; state two&mdash;b <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> fuses blown). In the present embodiment shown, the INIT signal is normally active high, and after the pulse goes low, the state of the fuse circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is latched, with a logic zero output when none of the fuses is blown and a logic one when at least one of the fuses is blown. Described in a different way, the node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is coupled to the voltage reference (VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) when none of the plurality of fuses are blown and decoupled from the voltage reference (VREF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) when at least one of the plurality of fuses is blown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates redundant fuses used in conjunction with fuse status circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Fuse status circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, optional P-channel transistors <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, NOR gate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, fuse <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and fuse <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. When the fuse control signal, FC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, on the gate of N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is set high, N-channel transistor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> drives a large amount of current through fuse <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, causing fuse <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to blow (i.e., become an open-circuit).

Depending on whether the OUT signal is an active high or an active low signal, NOR gate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may also be implemented as an OR gate. If fuse <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is not blown, fuse <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> shorts a first input (input A) of NOR/OR gate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to ground (i.e., Logic 0). Otherwise, input A appears to be a Logic 1.
