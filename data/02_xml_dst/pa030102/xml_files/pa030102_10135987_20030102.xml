<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor memory device which is capable of adjusting the number of banks and a method for adjusting the number of banks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the time taken to access data in dynamic access random memories (DRAMs) can be reduced by increasing the number of banks including memory blocks and thus decreasing losses in row active time. However, the increase in the number of banks decreases the efficiency of repairing defective rows in each of the banks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a conventional semiconductor memory device using a memory block as one bank. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor memory device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes 2N (where N is a natural number) banks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the banks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> include normal memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, respectively, and redundant memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method for replacing a defective cell in the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a normal cell in the redundant memory cell block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The redundant cell block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be set to substitute for a plurality of defective cells. However, the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is supposed to substitute for only one defective cell in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If the bank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is activated, the other banks <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are activated except the bank <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> operate normally. However, since the bank <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inactive, in other words, since the bank <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is precharged, the bank <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> cannot use the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if two or more defective rows are generated in the bank <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is impossible to replace the defective rows with redundant rows in the conventional memory device having such a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a conventional semiconductor memory device using two memory blocks as one bank. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> semiconductor memory device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes N (where N is a natural number) banks <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the bank <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes two normal memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and two redundant memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A method for repairing two defective rows in the normal memory cell block will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. If the bank <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is activated, sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> operate normally. Thus, if two defective rows are generated in the bank <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the two defective rows are repaired by using the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating the translation of bank selection addresses into row addresses in the case of transforming a semiconductor memory device including 32 banks into a semiconductor memory device including 16 banks. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the differences in bank selection addresses and row addresses between a semiconductor memory device including 32 banks and a semiconductor memory device including 16 banks, with an arrow to indicate the transformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor memory device including 2<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>banks needs N bank selection addresses for selecting each of the 2<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>banks. Accordingly, in the case of a semiconductor memory device including 32 banks, each bank selection address BADR&lt;i&gt; (where i is a natural number between 0 and 4) for selecting the 32 banks is comprised of 5 bits. On the other hand, in the case of a semiconductor memory device including 16 banks, each bank selection address BADR&lt;i&gt; (where i is a natural number between 0 and 3) for selecting the 16 banks is comprised of 4-bit addresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For the case of either 16 or 32 banks, there is a row address made from n&plus;1 bits. These bits are labeled row addresses RADR&lt;i&gt; (where i is a natural number between 0 and n). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, there is a bank address. For the general case of 32 banks, the bank address has five bits BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;. For the general case of 16 banks, however, the bank address has only four bits BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&gt;, BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&gt;. There will be no need for bit BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the particular case, however, where there is a conversion from 32 banks to 16 banks, there will be one less bank bit, but one more row address bit. More particularly, bit BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;, which is the most significant bit, is used as a translation row address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt; bit. Nevertheless, the total number of bits remains the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the bank <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is selected by the bank selection address BADR&lt;i&gt; (where i is a natural number between 0 and 3), and the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is selected by the translation row address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt;. In other words, the translation row address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt; is used to select one out of two normal memory cell blocks constituting one bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A limitation of the prior art is that banks cannot be integrated easily, to exploit the redundancy. That is because semiconductor memory devices including 32 banks and semiconductor memory devices including 16 banks must be integrated in different chips. Such chips, which are designed as different integrated circuits, must be separately tested using different repairing methods. Accordingly, different manufacturing processes and testing processes are required for individual products, which makes it hard to reconfigure the blocks of a device from 32 banks to 16 banks. This lowers the productivity in a manufacturing process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method for adjusting the number of banks from 32 to 16 in the case of using a semiconductor memory device including 32 banks according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A method for setting the semiconductor memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to have 32 banks will be described first. Each of the 32 banks is supposed to include one memory block, in other words, one normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and a corresponding one redundant cell block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, respectively. In addition, the programmable master fuse set <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is supposed to activate the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE. In this embodiment, this is implemented by making the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The first switch SW-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned off in response to the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE, which has been activated, thus blocking the output signal of the input buffer <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. A transistor N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on, and sets the bias level of the voltage of the pad <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> to a ground voltage level VSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The second switch SW-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on in response to the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE. This way second switch SW-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the most significant bit MSB, that is, the bank selection address BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;, of the bank selection addresses to the first node PSBE. As a result, one of the 32 banks can be selected by a combination of the bank selection addresses BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&gt; and the most significant bit MSB, that is, the bank selection address BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The redundant address fuse set <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> responds to the output signal of the address input buffer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the output signal of the first node PSBE. In a case where the semiconductor memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> operates normally, the first switch SW-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is off. Thus, the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> does not program the memory block selection address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt;, and the enable master fuse <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> outputs the enable signal F-EN as inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As a result, the transistor M<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the first block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is turned on, and the block switching signal BLKS becomes logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;. Thus, the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> activates the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> However, if a defect occurs at a normal cell of the memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the fuses F-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and F-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are cut, and the selection of the first fuse <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is set to a &lsquo;don&apos;t care&rsquo; condition, so that the defective normal memory cell can be replaced by a redundant memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, some of the fuses F-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through F-n are selectively blown for selecting the address of the defective normal memory cell in response to the row addresses RADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:n&gt; input to the second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In other words, the enable signal F-EN is activated, and the transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through M<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are turned on. Then, the appropriate ones of fuses F-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through F-n are cut, except for those connected to a row address to be repaired. Accordingly, the second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is programmed as the row address to be repaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the block switching signal BLKS is inactivated, the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> selects one of the 32 banks in response to the combination of the 4-bit bank selection addresses BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&gt; (which is the output signal of the input buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>), and of the most significant bit MSB, that is, the bank selection address BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt; (which is the output signal of the first node PSBE). The controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> thus simultaneously selects a wordline WL of a memory cell of the selected bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, signals BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt; and /BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt; represent the most significant bit (MSB) of the bank selection addresses for selecting the 32 banks. In other words, if the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of one of the 32 banks is activated by the output signal of the controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> activate the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to sense the data of the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> However, the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is inactivated, and thus if there is a defective row in the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the defective row of the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is replaced by only the redundant memory cell block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method is described for setting the semiconductor memory device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to have 16 banks. Each of the 16 banks includes two normal memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, and two redundant cell blocks <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The programmable master fuse set <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> inactivates the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE, in other words, make the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Since the first switch SW-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on in response to the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE being inactive, the memory block selection address RADR&lt;n&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt; is translated to the first node PSBE. That address contains the most significant bit MSB, that is, the bank selection address BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt;, for selecting 32 banks input via the pad <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The memory block selection address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt; selects one of the normal memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> of a particular bank, which has been selected by the bank selection addresses BADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The second switch SW-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off, in response to the bank control master clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-BE being inactive. In addition, the transistor N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, and sets the bias level of the voltage of the pad <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> to a ground voltage level VSS. This blocks the path of the input buffer <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> selects one of the 16 banks in response to the 4-bit bank selection addresses BADR&lt;0:3&gt;. In this case, the memory block selection address RADR&lt;n&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt; selects one of the normal memory cell blocks <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in the selected bank, and simultaneously selects a wordline of a memory cell in the selected bank in response to the output signal of the address input buffer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> If the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> constituting each of the <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> banks is activated, the sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are activated. On the other hand, if the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is activated, the sense amplifiers <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method for repairing two defective rows in the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with a redundant cell block will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In a case where the memory block selection address RADR&lt;n&plus;1&gt; is input into the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, the fuses F-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are cut so as to select a memory block Block-j among memory blocks Block-i and Block-j. The second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> programs the row addresses RADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:n&gt; for selecting redundant memory cells of the memory block Block-j. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> According to the programming of the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, the block switching signal BLKS is activated. Then, the fuses of the first and second fuse blocks <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are programmed, thus activating the redundant enable signal RES. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In addition, the fuse F-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and one of the fuses F-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and F-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are selectively cut to program the addresses of defective memory cells, and a plurality of fuses F-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through F-n constituting the second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are selectively decoded, to program the addresses of the defective memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in a case where the row addresses RADR&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>:n&gt; input via the address input buffer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are the same as defective row addresses, the block switching signal BLKS from first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, disables a control circuit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> for controlling the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a control circuit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> for controlling the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and a control circuit <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> for controlling the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Block switching signal BLKS then enables a control circuit <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> for controlling the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> for controlling the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and a control circuit <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> for controlling the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When there are defective rows in the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, it is possible to repair the normal memory cell block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> adjacent to the redundant cell block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This increases the repairing efficiency, and thus also the manufacturing yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor memory device of the present invention includes the programmable master fuse set <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and a redundant programmable address decoder, i.e., the first fuse block <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> or the second fuse block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. Thus, the semiconductor memory device of the present invention can adjust the number of banks and can simultaneously program repairing of defective cells with the use of the redundant programmable address decoder. </paragraph>
