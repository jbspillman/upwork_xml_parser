<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical disc apparatus for recording data on an optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, various types of optical disc apparatuses for recording or reproducing data using a light beam have been developed. As write once type optical discs, CD-R/RW discs, DVD-RAM discs, DVD-R/RW discs have been, for example, developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A DVD-R/RW has a convexed pit referred to as a &ldquo;pre-pit&rdquo; in each of land tracks interposing groove tracks (landpre-pit). A landpre-pit is detected by level-slicing a push-pull signal at a prescribed slicing level. The push-pull signal is obtained when the groove track is irradiated with a light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain a recording clock signal in synchronization with a linear velocity of the rotating optical disc which is rotating, the track is waved at a prescribed cycle. This wave is referred to as a &ldquo;wobble&rdquo;. Wobbles are located so as to have a prescribed phase relationship with the landpre-pits. Like the landpre-pit, the wobble is also detected by level-slicing a push-pull signal at a prescribed slicing level. By detecting the frequency of the wobbles and multiplying the frequency by a prescribed value, a recording clock signal corresponding to a unit time length of a recording mark can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, data is recorded on a DVD-R/RW disc in synchronization with a recording clock signal obtained from the wobbles based on the land pre-pit signal. In the case where data is already recorded on the DVD-R/RW disc, very highly precise recording position control is required so that there is no gap or discontinuity between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The DVD-R/RW disc has a track pitch of 0.74 &mgr;m, which is half of the track pitch of a CD-R/RW disc of 1.6 &mgr;m. The CD-R/RW disc is another write once type optical disc. Due to such a narrow track pitch, in the DVD-R/RW disc, the influence of interference from tracks adjacent to the track of interest (i.e., crosstalk) is highly noticeable. A fluctuation in the wobble amplitude and phase caused by the crosstalk affects, in the form of jitters, the recording clock obtained by multiplying the frequency of the wobbles by a prescribed value. The recording clock extracted from the wobbles is mainly used for generating a recording timing signal for the purpose of, for example, synchronization of recording data. Therefore, the jitters in the recording clock may undesirably deviate the recording position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A land pre-pit signal itself involves a jitter component due to, for example, interference with the recording mark which is already recorded, and a difference between the power of the light beam in the state of forming a recording mark for the purpose of recording and the light beam in other states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, recording of data which is performed after the recording timing signal is determined based on the land pre-pit signal may result in the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data being undesirably discontinuous. Such discontinuity affects bit synchronization or frame synchronization which is performed for reproduction. As a result, the connection portion between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data cannot be reproduced in a superb manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem, Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-187947 titled &ldquo;Optical disc recording apparatus&rdquo; proposes an optical disc of a system for reproducing a synchronization signal included in the previously recorded data and adjusting a timing of recording the data to be newly recorded based on the synchronization signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Depending on the influence of the crosstalk or the difference between the states of recording, a reproduction clock obtained from the previously recorded data and a reproduction clock obtained from the newly recorded data may have different frequencies or phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In such a case, there is a problem in that the connection portion between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data cannot be reproduced in a superb manner until the frequency of the reproduction clock is stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem. Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-298955 titled &ldquo;Information recording apparatus and information recording method&rdquo; proposes an optical disc of a system for synchronizing the frequency or phase of a recording clock to the frequency or phase of the reproduction clock of the previously recorded data and then, after the recording operation starts, recovering the frequency or phase of the recording clock to the original frequency or phase at a prescribed time constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, the optical discs described in the above-described publications have the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the system for reproducing a synchronization signal included in the previously recorded data and adjusting the timing of recording the data to be newly recorded based on the synchronization signal, the positional deviation of the previously recorded data remains in the newly recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The system for synchronizing the frequency or phase of a recording clock to the frequency or phase of the reproduction clock of the previously recorded data and then, after the recording operation starts, recovering the frequency or phase of the recording clock to the original frequency or phase at a prescribed time constant, involves the following problem. Frequency errors of the recording clock, which are generated in a transition state in which the frequency or phase of the recording clock changes after the recording operation starts, are accumulated. Thus, a timing error is generated at a recording position. As a result, a positional deviation occurs for the newly recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The amounts of deviation of recording position are Accumulated each time data is additionally written and may result in a significant deviation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As an example of an optical disc usable for recording and reproduction performed, by an optical disc apparatus according to the present invention, an optical disc conforming to the DVD-R/RW (Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable/Re-Recordable) Standards will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a structure of an optical disc conforming to the DVD-R/RW Standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The optical disc has a recording groove (groove track) spirally formed on a surface thereof. When the groove track is irradiated with a light beam, the optical characteristics of the recording film of the groove track change. As a result, a recording mark is formed on the groove track. Thus, the data is recorded on the groove track. The recording film is formed of an organic colorant or a phase change material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Data recorded on the optical disc includes at least one ECC (Error Correction Code) block. An ECC block is a minimum unit for error correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An ECC block includes 16 sectors (sectors 0 through 15). The 16 sectors each include 26 frames (frames 0 through 25). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The 26 frames each include a 2-byte synchronization signal (SY)and 1488T data (i.e., a 32T sync code and a 1456T data code). The 32T sync code and the 1456T data code are obtained by performing 8-16 modulation of 91-byte data. Here, &ldquo;1T&rdquo; refers to a unit time length of a recording mark. &ldquo;1T&rdquo; corresponds to 38.2 ns (1/(26.16 MHz)) at the standard speed of the DVD-R/RW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A sync code is a code including &ldquo;a recording mark having a length of 14T and a space having a length of 4T&rdquo; or a code including &ldquo;a space having a length of 14T and a code having a length of 4T&rdquo;. Here, a &ldquo;space&rdquo; refers to an area interposed between two adjacent recording marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A leading frame (frame 0) of each sector includes 4-byte address information referred to as a data ID and a 2-byte ID error detection code referred to as an IED (ID Error Detection Code). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A groove track is waved at a prescribed cycle (wobbles). Wobbles have a frequency of about 140.6 kHz at the standard speed of the DVD-R/RW. By multiplying the frequency of the wobbles by 186 (140.6 kHz&times;186&equals;26.16 MHz), a clock signal having the unit time length of the recording mark is obtained. In other words, 1 wobble has 186T, and 1 frame (1488T) includes 8 wobbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The optical disc has pits ref erred to as land pre -pits (LPP) on a land track between two adjacent groove tracks. The land pre-pits are used as a positional reference for recording and physical address information. The land pre-pits are formed during the production of the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A land pre-pit is convexed toward the light beam directed thereto. A land pre-pit is corresponded to the groove track which is immediately adjacent thereto and closer to the center of the optical disc than the land pre-pit. The land pre-pit is located at the apex of a wobble of the groove track corresponding thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Among the 26 frames included in each sector, even-numbered frames are referred to as &ldquo;EVEN frames&rdquo;, and odd-numbered frames are referred to as &ldquo;ODD frames&rdquo;. Especially, the leading frame (frame 0) of the sector is referred to as an &ldquo;EVEN sync frame&rdquo;, and the second frame (frame 1) of the sector is referred to as an &ldquo;ODD sync frame&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In principle, LPP codes obtained by the conversion shown in Table 1 are located at the apexes of the first three wobbles among the eight wobbles included in each EVEN frame. In the case where the LPP code on the inner side of a groove track is different from the LPP code on the outer side of the groove track, the LPP code on the outer side of the groove track is exceptionally shifted to the ODD frame. This is done in order to prevent crosstalk between two adjacent LPP codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> By converting the 13 LPP codes included in each sector using Table 1, 13-bit information (a 1-bit sync code and 12-bit LPP information) is obtained for each sector.

The 13-bit information is defined for each ECC block (16 sectors) The first 4 bit (bit 1 throughout 4) of the 12-bit LPP information is referred to as an &ldquo;RA&rdquo; (Relative Address) and represents a sector number in the ECC block. The remaining 8 bits (bit 5 through bit 12) of the 12-bit LPP information represents two sets of ECC block addresses (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;pre-pit addresses&rdquo;) and two sets of error correction codes (parities) for the ECC block. </paragraph>

According to the DVD-R/RW standards, data is recorded in units of ECC blocks. The position at which the data recording is started is rearward by 18 bytes with respect to the border between two adjacent ECC blocks. The position at which the data recording is finished is also rearward by 18 bytes with respect to the border between two adjacent ECC blocks. Thus, the end of the previously recorded data is rearward by 18 bytes with respect to the border between two adjacent ECC blocks. Therefore, new data is recorded from the position which is rearward 18 bytes with respect to the border between the two adjacent ECC blocks. Then, no discontinuity occurs between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The new data is recorded on a groove track so that the circumference position on the groove track, at which the center of the 14T-long mark or space included in the sync code of the new data is located matches the circumferential position of the land pre-pit on the land track adjacent to the groove track. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> directs a light beam having a prescribed reproduction power to the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The light beam output from the pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is driven by a driving signal which output from the light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is control led based on a reproduction power control signal which is output from the power control circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The light beam directed to the optical disc is reflected by the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is incident on the pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The light reflected by the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has properties in accordance with the optical and physical characteristics of a recording film of the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reflecting the light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of light receiving circuits (not shown). Each receiving circuit converts the amount of reflected light incident thereon into an electric signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The reproduction amplification circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> adds all the electric signals obtained as a result of conversion performed by the receiving circuits and amplifies the resultant sum, so as to generate an RF (Radio Frequency) signal. The reproduction amplification circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> obtains a difference signal representing a difference in amplitude between electric signals obtained by light receiving circuits having a border therebetween substantially parallel to the track of the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The reproduction amplification circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> then amplifies the difference signal, so as to generate a push-pull signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit reproduction circuit a includes a comparator (not shown) for comparing the level of a push-pull signal and a prescribed slicing level. When the level of the push-pull signal is higher than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a H-level signal. When the level of the push-pull signal is lower than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a L-level signal. Thus, pre-pit reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> outputs a pulse-like pre-pit signal. The prescribed slicing level is set so as to be substantially the median between the maximum level of land pre-pit portion of the push-pull signal and the maximum level of the wobble portion of the push-pull signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The wobble reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> includes a BPF (Band Pass Filter; not shown) for allowing a wobble frequency component (around 140-6 kHz at the standard speed of the DVD-R/RW) to pass, and a comparator (not shown) for comparing the level of a signal after a noise component and a land pre-pit component are removed by the BPF with a prescribed slicing level. When the level of the signal is higher than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a H-levee signal. When the level of the signal is lower than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a L-level signal. Thus, the wobble reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> outputs a rectangular wave-shaped wobble signal representing the frequency of the wobbles. The prescribed slicing level is set so as to be substantially the median of the amplitude of the wobble signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The data reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a comparator (not shown) for comparing the level of an RF signal and a prescribed slicing level. When the level of the RF signal is higher than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a H-level signal. When the level of the RF signal is lower than the prescribed slicing level, the comparator outputs a L-level signal. Thus, the data reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> outputs a rectangular wave-shaped data reproduction signal. The prescribed slicing level is set so that a value obtained by integrating the H-level of a level-sliced RF signal in a prescribed period is substantially equal to a value obtained by integrating the L-level of the level-sliced RF signal in the prescribed period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The reproduction clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generates a reproduction clock having a frequency corresponding to the length of 1T as follows. The reproduction clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of a reproduction clock so that the minimum length in which the data reproduction signal can maintain the H-level or L-level (3T) includes 3 cycles of the reproduction clock and so that the maximum length in which the data reproduction signal can maintain the H-level or L-level (14T) includes 14 cycles of the reproduction clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit window protection circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> predicts the timing at which the next pre-pit signal is output from the pre-pit reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> based on the timing at which the previous pre-pit signal was output from the pre-pit reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The pre-pit window protection circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> then eliminates pre-pit signals which are output at timings other than the predicted timing. Thus, the number of times of erroneous detection of the pre-pit can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extracts, among pre-pit signals output from the pre-pit window protection circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a pre-pit sync detection signal corresponding to a prescribed pre-pit (for example, a land pre-pit pre-formed in correspondence with the leading frame (frame 0) of the sector). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit window protection circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be omitted. Regardless of whether or not the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes the pre-pit window protection circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the pre-pit sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> operates to detect a prescribed pre-pit pre-formed on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (for example, a land pre-pit pre-formed in correspondence with the leading frame (frame 0) of the sector) and to output a pre-pit sync detection signal in response to the detection of the prescribed pre-pit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit demodulation circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> converts the pre-pit signal in synchronization with the pre-pit sync detection signal in accordance with Table 1. Thus, LPP information including a 4-bit RA (Relative Address) and 8-bit data is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit address extraction circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> stores, in a memory, data included in the LPP information based on the RA included in the LPP information, performs a prescribed error correction for the data stored in the memory, and extracts a pre-pit address from the data stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The data sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> synchronizes the data reproduction signal at the timing of the reproduction clock so as to detect a prescribed synchronization signal included in the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then outputs a data sync detection signal in response to the detection of the prescribed synchronization signal. Here, the prescribed synchronization signal included in the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, for example, a sync code including &ldquo;a recording mark having a length of 14T and a space having a length of 4T&rdquo; or a sync code including &ldquo;a space having a length of 14T and a recording mark having a length of 4T&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The data sync window protection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> predicts the timing at which the next data sync detection signal is output from the data sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> based on the timing at which the previous data sync detection signal was output from the data sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The data sync window protection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> then eliminates data sync detection signals which are output at timings other than the predicted timing. Thus, the number of occurrences of erroneous detection of the prescribed synchronization signal included in the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (for example, sync code) can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The 8-16 demodulation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> performs 8-16 demodulation of the data reproduction signal in response to the data sync detection signal which is output from the data sync window protection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Then, the 8-16 demodulation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outputs demodulated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The data sync window protection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be omitted. When the data sync window protection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is omitted, the 8-16 demodulation circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can perform 8-16 demodulation of the data reproduction signal in response to the data sync detection signal which is output from the data sync detection circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then output demodulated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The data ID extraction circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extracts a data ID from the demodulated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generates a recording clock, and also detects a time-wise amount of deviation between the pre-pit sync detection signal and the data sync detection signal. The recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of the recording clock so as to correct the detected time-wise amount of deviation. The recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be described in more detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The lock detection circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> detects that the frequency of the recording clock is stable in a prescribed range and outputs a lock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> refers to the extracted pre-pit address or data ID to check whether or not the pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has reached such a position as to allow data to be recorded. When the system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> confirms that the pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has reached such a position and further detects the lock signal which indicates that the frequency of the recording clock is stable, the system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> instructs the recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to record data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> control a recording operation based on the instruction from the system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Specifically, this operation is performed as follows. The system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the data is recorded immediately before an assumed recording starting point. In the case where no data is recorded immediately before the assumed recording starting point, the recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> determines an actual recording starting point based on the pre-pit signal. In the case where data is recorded immediately before the assumed recording starting point, the recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> determines an actual recording starting point based on the data sync detection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Whether data is recorded immediately before the recording starting position or not is determined by, for example, referring to TOC information which is recorded in a lead-in area. Alternatively, whether data is recorded immediately before the recording starting position or not is determined in accordance with whether or not the amplitude of the RF signal is equal to or greater than a prescribed level. Still alternatively, whether data is recorded immediately before the recording starting position or not is determined in accordance with whether or not the synchronization signal is detected a prescribed number of times or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the case where the data is recorded immediately before the assumed recording starting point, the actual recording starting point is determined based on the data sync detection signal. In this manner, new data can be recorded so as to be continuous from the recorded data. Thus, the recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, together with the error correction circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the 8-16 modulation circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the power control circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can act as a recording section for recording new data on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to be continuous from the recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> outputs a recording gate signal. For example, an activated state (H level) of the recording gate signal indicates that recording is permitted, and an inactivated state (L level) of the recording gate signal-indicates that recording is prohibited. In this case, the point at which the recording gate signal is transited from the inactivated state (L level) to the activated state (H level), i.e., the rising edge of the recording gate signal, corresponds to the recording starting point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When the recording gate signal is activated, the error correction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> adds an error correction code to the data to be recorded. The 8-16 modulation circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> modulates the signal which is output from the error correction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and outputs the resultant modulated signal in synchronization with the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When the recording gate signal is activated, the power control circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outputs a recording power control signal to the light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> converts the level-sliced modulated signal to a driving signal having a prescribed pulse pattern based on a prescribed light strategy, and outputs the driving signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The pickup <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> directs the light beam in accordance with the driving signal to the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and thus changes the optical characteristics of the recording film so as to form a recording mark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be described in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> generates a first rectangular wave in synchronization with the recording clock, based an the pre-pit sync detection signal. The first rectangular wave is generated using, for example, a counter (first counter), the counting value of which is incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the first counter is preset to a prescribed value (A) in response to the pre-pit sync detection signal regardless of the state of the recording clock (activated state or inactivated state). When the counting value of the first counter reaches a prescribed value (B) the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> changes the level of the first rectangular wave from the H level to the L level. When the counting value of the first counter reaches a prescribed value (C), the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> changes the level of the first rectangular wave from the L level to the H level. When the counting value of the first counter reaches a prescribed value (D), the counting value of the first counter is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the counting value of the first counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. Thus, the first rectangular wave having an alternately changing level between the H level and the L level is output from the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> generates a second rectangular waves in synchronization with the recording clock, based on the data sync detection signal. The second rectangular wave is generated using, for example, a counter (second counter), the counting value of which is incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the second counter is preset to a prescribed value (E) in response to the data sync detection signal only when the recording clock is in an inactivated state. When the counting value of the second counter reaches the prescribed value (B), the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> changes the level of the second rectangular wave from the H level to the L level. When the counting value of the second counter reaches the prescribed value (C), the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> changes the level of the second rectangular wave from the L level to the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When the counting value of the second counter reaches the prescribed value (D), the counting value of the second counter is reset to No. Thereafter, the counting value of the second counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. Thus, the second rectangular wave having an alternately changing level between the H level and the L level is output from the second timing signal-generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The prescribed values (A) and (E) are preset so that the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave is substantially zero when new data is recorded on an ideal position on the groove track (i.e. the position of the new data which is recorded so that the circumferential position on the groove track, at which the center of the 14T-long mark or space included in the sync code of the new data is located, matches the circumferential position of the land pre-pit on the land track adjacent to the groove track). In this specification, &ldquo;substantially zero&rdquo; refers to a range, including 0, which can be permitted from the viewpoint of the design of the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The prescribed value (D) is preset so as to be equal to a multiple of the length of one cycle of wobbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the above, the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> act as a detection section for detecting an amount of deviation between the position of data which is already recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the position at which the data should have been recorded. The position of data which is already recorded on the optical disc L is detected based on, for examples the data sync detection signal. The position at which the data should have been recorded is detected based on, for example, the pre-pit sync detection signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> outputs a first phase difference signal representing the difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave. The phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> maybe constructed to be operable only when the recording gate signal is in an activated state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> restricts the time-wise change amount of the first phase difference signal, and outputs the first phase difference signal having the restricted time-wise change amount as a correction amount signal to the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The time-wise change amount of the first phase difference signal is restricted in order to adjust a response speed so that a data reproduction PLL for reproducing data recorded by the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can generate a reproduction clock sufficiently quickly. Therefore, when such response speed adjustment is not necessary, the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be omitted. The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be realized by, for example, an LPF (Low Pass Filter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of the recording clock so that the level of the correction amount signal is substantially zero (i.e., so that the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave approaches &ldquo;0&rdquo; or is substantially &ldquo;0&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the above, the phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> act as a control circuit for controlling the frequency of the recording clock so that the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave approaches &ldquo;0&rdquo; or is substantially &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also act as an adjustment section for adjusting the position at which the new data is to be recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having data already recorded thereon. The adjustment is performed so that even when the position of the already recorded data is deviated from the position at which the data should have been recorded, the position of the end of the new data matches the position at which the end of the new data should be recorded (i.e., so that the deviation between the position at which the end of the new data is actually recorded and the position at which the end of the new data should be recorded is substantially zero). The position at which the new data in to be recorded can be adjusted by, for example, adjusting the frequency of the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The adjustment section may adjust the position at which the new data is to be recorded so that the deviation between the position at which the end of the new data is actually recorded and the position at which the end of the new data should be recorded is smaller than the deviation between the position of data which is already recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the position at which the data should have been recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the case where the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a reference frequency detection section for detecting a reference frequency of the recording clock, the adjustment section may control the frequency of the recording clock so that the frequency of the recording clock is closer to the reference frequency. For example, the wobble reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may act as the reference frequency detection section, because the frequency of the wobble signal output from the wobble reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be used as the reference frequency of the recording clock. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The charge pump <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> converts the second phase difference signal to a voltage level signal. The first LPF <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> removes a high frequency component from the voltage level signal.

It is assumed that the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has data recorded at a position which is deviated from the position at Which the data should have been recorded. The optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> records the new data so that the newly recorded data is continuous to the already recorded data and so that the amounts of positional deviation are not accumulated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The pre-pit signal is output from the pre-pit reproduction circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>).

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> outputs the first rectangular wave based on the pre-pit sync detection signal.

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an exemplary operation of the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The counter (first counter) built in the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> increments the counter value thereof in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the first counter is preset to &ldquo;24&rdquo; in response to the pre-pit sync detection signal. When the counting value of the first counter reaches &ldquo;46&rdquo;, the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> changes the level of the first rectangular wave from the H level to the L level. When the counting value of the first counter reaches &ldquo;139&rdquo;, the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> changes the level of the first rectangular wave from the L level to the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> When the counting value of the first counter reaches &ldquo;185&rdquo;, the counting value of the first counter is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the counting value of the first counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. Thus, the first rectangular wave having an alternately changing level between the H level and the L level is output from the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The cycle of the first rectangular wave is 186T. Accordingly, the first rectangular wave can be generated by the first timing signal generator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by dividing the frequency of the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The counter (second counter) built in the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> increments the counter value thereof in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the second counter is preset to &ldquo;32&rdquo; in response to the data sync detection signal, When the counting value of the second counter reaches &ldquo;46&rdquo;, the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> changes the level of the second rectangular wave from the H level to the L level. When the counting value of the second counter reaches &ldquo;139&rdquo;, the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> changes the level of the first rectangular wave from the L level to the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When the counting value of the second counter reaches &ldquo;185&rdquo;, the counting value of the second counter is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the counting value of the second counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. Thus, the second rectangular wave having an alternately changing level between the H level and the L level is output from the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The cycle of the second rectangular wave is 186T. Accordingly, the second rectangular wave can be generated by the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by dividing the frequency of the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the case where the position of the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> matches the position at which the data should have been recorded (i.e., in the case where the data is recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with no positional deviation), the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave are adjusted to have a phase difference of substantially &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Therefore, in the case where the position of the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deviated forward with respect to the position at which the data should have been recorded, the second rectangular wave is output, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, with the phase being deviated forward with respect to the phase of the first rectangular wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When prescribed conditions are fulfilled, the system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> instructs the recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to record data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The recording control circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> activates the recording gate signal in accordance with the instruction from the system controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and also controls a recording circuit system (including the error correction circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the 8-16 modulation circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the power control circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the light beam driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) so that the new data is recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the recording clock based on the data sync detection signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows waveforms of the signals and the operations of the circuits in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> When the recording gate signal is activated, each circuit of the recording circuit system starts a recording operation, and the second counter in the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is prohibited from being preset. Thus, when the position of the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deviated forward with respect to the position at which the data should have been recorded, the second rectangular wave is output with the phase being deviated forward with respect to the phase of the first rectangular wave, immediately after the recording operation starts. After the recording operation starts, the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave changes in accordance with the correction amount of the recording position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The phase difference detector <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> detects the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave, and thus outputs the first phase difference signal. The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> outputs a correction amount signal obtained by restricting the time-wise change amount of the first phase difference signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Before the recording operation starts, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal. After the recording operation starts, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adds the correction amount signal to the loop of the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thus controls the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the correction amount signal as well as the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal. Specifically, when the second rectangular wave is output with the phase being deviated forward with respect to the phase of the first rectangular wave, the frequency of the recording clock can be controlled to be decreased. When, by contrast, the second rectangular wave is output with the phase being deviated rearward with respect to the phase of the first rectangular wave, the frequency of the recording clock can be controlled to be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The above-described control operation of the recording clock is repeated until the deviation of the recording position is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (i.e., until the phase difference between the first rectangular wave and the second rectangular wave becomes zero). When the deviation of the recording position is eliminated, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is switched to operate to control the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may control the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the wobble signal instead of the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As described above, the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first example records the new data based on the data sync detection signal at the connection portion between the previously recorded data and the new data. Therefore, the continuity between the previously recorded data and the new data is guaranteed. Even when the position of the previously recorded data is deviated from the position at which the-data should have been recorded, the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> detects the amount of deviation and controls the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the detected amount of deviation. Therefore, the deviation of the recording position does not remain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with both the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal, but the present invention is not limited to this. It is not necessary that the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal are input to the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It is sufficient that the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can add a correction amount signal to the loop for generating a recording clock and control the frequency of the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the phase shift frequency divided clock, which is one input to the phase comparator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is further shifted in accordance with the correction amount signal. Alternatively, the wobble signal output from the noise filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which is another input to the phase comparator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, may be further shifted in accordance with the correction amount signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Still alternatively, after the correction amount signal is converted into a voltage level signal, the correction amount signal may be added to the output of the charge pump <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in an analog manner. The same effect as above is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows another structure of the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In this example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a selector <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, a phase difference detector <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, a third LPF <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, and a phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> in addition to the elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can control the frequency of the recording clock also in accordance with the second rectangular wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The selector <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> selects either the second rectangular wave phase-shifted by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> or the wobble signal output from the noise filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The phase difference detector <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> detects the phase difference between the second rectangular wave phase-shifted by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and the wobble signal output from the noise filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and outputs a fourth phase difference signal representing the detected phase difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The third LPF <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> removes a high frequency component from the fourth phase difference signal, and outputs the resultant fourth phase difference signal with the time-wise change amount being restricted to the phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> as a second correction amount signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> shifts the phase of the second rectangular wave in accordance with the second correction amount signal so that the phase of the second rectangular wave matches the phase of the wobble signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows waveforms of the signals and the operations of the circuits in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Before the recording operation starts, the second counter built in the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is operated in synchronization with a reproduction clock which is output from the reproduction clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and thus the second timing signal generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> outputs the second rectangular wave in synchronization with the reproduction clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Before the recording operation starts, the phase shifter <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> operates so as to correct the phase difference between the second rectangular wave and the wobble signal (for example, so that the phase of the second rectangular wave matches the phase of the wobble signal) in accordance with the second correction amount signal. This operation corresponds to the period marked with *1 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When the correction of the phase difference between the second rectangular wave and the wobble signal is completed (for example, when the phase of the second rectangular wave matches the phase of the wobble signal), the selector <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is controlled to select the second rectangular wave instead of the wobble signal. As a result, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> operates to multiply the second rectangular wave obtained by dividing the frequency of the reproduction clock and thus to generate a recording clock. This operation corresponds to the period marked with *2 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, towing to this operation, a recording clock having an equal frequency to that of the reproduction clock can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> After the recording operation starts, the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> operates in substantially the same manner as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Before the recording operation starts, the frequency of the recording clock can be controlled using the second rectangular wave generated based on the reproduction clock. After the recording operation starts, the deviation of the recording position can be corrected, and the frequency of the recording clock can be controlled in accordance with the pre-pit signal and the wobble signal. The recording clock it obtained in synchronization with the frequency of the reproduction clock which is obtained from the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the difference in frequency between the data already recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the new data can be reduced. As a result, the continuity in frequency can also be guaranteed between the data recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the new data. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the second example includes a first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>, a second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, a subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, a filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an exemplary operation of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> includes a first counter, the counting value of which is incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the first counter is preset to a prescribed value (F) in response to the pre-pit sync detection signal regardless of the state of the recording clock (activated state or inactivated state). The first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> outputs the counting value of the first counter as the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> When the counting value of the first counter reaches <highlight><bold>1488</bold></highlight> corresponding to one frame, the counting value of the first counter is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the counting value of the first counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> includes a second counter, the counting value of which is incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. The counting value of the second counter is preset to a prescribed value (G) in response to the data sync detection signal only when the recording clock is in an inactivated state. The second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> outputs the counting value of the second counter as the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> When the counting value of the Second counter reaches <highlight><bold>1488</bold></highlight> corresponding to one frame, the counting value of the second counter is reset to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Thereafter, the counting value of the second counter is again incremented one by one in synchronization with the recording clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The preset value (prescribed value (F)) of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the preset value (prescribed value (G)) of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> are preset so that the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is substantially zero when new data is recorded on an ideal position on the groove track (i.e., the position of the new data which is recorded so that the circumferential position on the groove track, at which the center of the 14T-long mark or space included in the sync code of the new data is located, matches the circumferential position of the land pre-pit on the land track adjacent to the groove track). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> outputs a difference signal representing a difference between the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. The optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be structured so that the subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> operates only when the recording gate signal is in an activated state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> restricts the time-wise change amount of the difference signal output from the subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, and outputs the difference signal having the restricted time-wise change amount as a correction amount signal to the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The time-wise change amount of the difference signal is restricted in order to adjust a response speed so that a data reproduction PLL for reproducing data recorded by the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can generate a reproduction clock sufficiently quickly. Therefore, when such response speed adjustment is not necessary, the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> maybe omitted. The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be realized by, for example, an LPF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the frequency of the recording clock so that the level of the correction amount signal approaches &ldquo;0&rdquo; or is substantially zero (i.e., so that the difference between the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> approaches &ldquo;0&rdquo; or is substantially &ldquo;0&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the above, the subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> act as a control circuit for controlling the frequency of the recording clock so that the difference between the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> approaches &ldquo;0&rdquo; or is substantially &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The structure of the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that of the PLL <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> described in the first example (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> As described above, the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the second example records the new data based on the data sync detection signal at the connection portion between the previously recorded data and the new data. Therefore, the continuity between the previously recorded data and the new data is guaranteed. Even when the position of the previously recorded data is deviated from the position at which the data should have been recorded, the optical disc apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> detects the amount of deviation and controls the frequency of the recording clock in accordance with the detected amount of deviation. Therefore, the deviation of the recording position does not remain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The correction amount is derived by calculating the value of the first timer <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the value of the second timer <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the recording clock generation circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be structured au a digital circuit. The functions of, for example, the subtractor <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be implemented as software. This allows the circuit scale to be reduced and also allows the filter characteristics to be easily variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, new data is recorded on an optical disc so as to be continuous from the data already recorded thereon. Thus, continuity between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data is guaranteed. Even when the position of the previously recorded data is deviated from the position at which the data should have been recorded, the position at which the new data is to be recorded is adjusted so as to be as follows: the amount of deviation between the position at which the end of the new data is recorded and the position at which the end of the new data should be recorded is smaller than the amount of deviation between the position at which the previously recorded data is recorded and the position at which the previously recorded data should have been recorded. By such adjustment, the amounts of deviation of recording position is prevented from being accumulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, new data is recorded on an optical disc Which has data already recorded thereon, based on a data sync detection signal. Thus, continuity between the previously recorded data and the newly recorded data is guaranteed. The time-wise deviation between the pre-pit sync detection signal and the data sync detection signal is detected, and the frequency of the recording clock is controlled so as to correct the time-wise deviation. By such control, the amounts of deviation of recording position is prevented from being accumulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. </paragraph>
