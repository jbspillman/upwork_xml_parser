<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A clock synchronization circuit. The clock synchronization circuit composed of a digital DLL outputs a clock signal delayed by a variable delay line and a clock signal delayed by an additional delay cell, mixes the two clock signals, and outputs an internal clock signal having a smaller delay than a delay time of a delay cell, thereby rapidly precisely synchronizing an external clock signal and the internal clock signal. In addition, a driving unit and a control unit for adjusting a duty cycle are provided to set up a ratio of 50%, thereby improving operation performance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a clock synchronization circuit for a semiconductor memory device, and in particular to a clock synchronization circuit which can improve a jitter property by outputting a clock signal having a phase between phases of two clock signals generated in a digital delay locked loop (DLL) with a predetermined time difference by using a phase mixing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a clock synchronization circuit such as a DLL or PLL is used as a clock-generating device for compensating for a skew between an external clock signal and data or between the external clock signal and an internal clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional clock synchronization circuit for a semiconductor memory device. Here, a linear register controlled DLL is exemplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The conventional clock synchronization circuit includes: a receiving unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for buffering an external clock signal EXCLK; a variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for delaying a buffered clock signal iCLK from the receiving unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and generating an internal clock signal INCLK; a delay monitor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for monitoring a delay time of the internal clock signal INCLK from the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; a phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for comparing a phase difference between the buffered clock signal iCLK and the internal clock signal INCLK, and outputting the results SHL and SHR; and a shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for controlling the delay time of the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the output signals SHL and SHR from the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The buffered clock signal iCLK obtained by buffering the external clock signal EXCLK is delayed by the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a predetermined time, and then outputted as the internal clock signal INCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The internal clock signal INCLK is inputted to the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the delay monitor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> judges whether the internal clock signal INCLK has a faster or slower phase than the buffered clock signal iCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> controls the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that the buffered clock signal iCLK and the internal clock signal INCLK have the same phase, and controls the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to delay the buffered clock signal iCLK for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a detailed circuit diagram illustrating the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the clock synchronization circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes: NAND gates ND<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-NDN for selectively outputting the buffered clock signal iCLK according to output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; unit delay cells DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-DELN connected in series for delaying the buffered clock signal iCLK selectively outputted by the NAND gates ND<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-NDN; and a NAND gate NDA having its one terminal connected to receive a power voltage VCC and its other terminal connected to receive the output signal from the last unit delay cell DELN, and outputting the internal clock signal INCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The unit delay cell DELN includes: a NAND gate ND<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N having its one input terminal connected to receive the output signal from the previous unit delay cell DEL(N&minus;1) and its other input terminal connected to receive the output signal from the NAND gate ND<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; a NAND gate ND<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>N having its one input terminal connected to receive the power voltage VCC and its other input terminal connected to receive the output signal from the NAND gate ND IN. Here, the other unit delay cells DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-DEL(N&minus;1) have the same constitution as the unit delay cell DELN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The operation of the conventional clock synchronization circuit will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When it is presumed that the second signal of the output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a high level and the other signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-SLN have a low level in an early stage, the buffered clock signal iCLK is delayed through a delay path from the second delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the last delay cell DELN, and outputted as the internal clock signal INCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Here, the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> compares the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK with the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK. When the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK is faster than that of the internal clock signal INCLK, the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputs the control signal SHL to shift left the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> That is, since the second signal SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a high level and the other signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-SLN have a low level in the early stage, the first signal SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a high level and the other signals SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-SLN have a low level according to the control signal SHL from the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the buffered clock signal iCLK is delayed through a delay path from the first delay cell DELI to the last delay cell DELN, and outputted as the internal clock signal INCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> compares the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK with the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK, if the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK is slower than the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK, the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> outputs the control signal SHR to shift the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Since the second signal SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a high level and the other signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-SLN have a low level in the early stage, the third signal SL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the output signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a high level and the other signals SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-SLN have a low level according to the control signal SHR from the phase detector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the buffered clock signal iCLK is delayed through a delay path from the third delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the last delay cell DELN, and outputted as the internal clock signal INCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a conventional clock synchronization circuit for a semiconductor memory device, the variable delay line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the unit delay cells DELI connected in series and each unit delay cell has serially-connected NAND gates ND<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and ND<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a number of the unit delay cells DELI is increased or decreased to adjust a delay time. The minimum time unit of the delay time are the delay time of one unit delay cell DELI. As a result, a precise delay cannot be performed in a smaller unit than the delay time of the unit delay cell DELI. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to improve a jitter property by adjusting a delay ratio in a clock synchronization circuit composed of a digital DLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to improve operation and performance by controlling the duty cycle of an internal clock signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The operation of the clock synchronization circuit in accordance with the present invention will now be explained. When it is presumed that the second signal of the output signals CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CSLN from the shift register <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is at a high level and the other signals CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CSL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-CSLN are at a low level in an early stage, the buffered clock signal iCLK is delayed through a delay path from the second delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the last delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N to output the normal delay clock signal NDS to the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the normal delay clock signal NDS is delayed through the additional delay cell ADEL for a predetermined time DL to output the additional delay clock signal ADS to the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Here, the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> outputs the internal clock signal INCLK having a phase between the phases of the normal delay clock signal NDS and the additional delay clock signal ADS according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A phase difference between the normal delay clock signal NDS and the additional delay clock signal ADS is the delay time of the additional delay cell ADEL. Since the additional delay cell ADEL has the same delay time as the unit delay cells DEL<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N, the phase difference is as long as the delay time of the unit delay cells DEL<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> outputs the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN to determine the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK from the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to approximate the phase of the normal delay clock signal NDS or the phase of the additional delay clock signal ADS, and then outputs the internal clock signal INCLK having a phase between the phases of the two input signals NDS and ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Here, the operation of the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is defined by the following Formula 1: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>INCLK&equals;NDS&times;</italic></highlight>(1&minus;&agr;)&plus;ADS&times;&agr;&emsp;&emsp;(formula 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Here, &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is determined by the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. When &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is increased, the internal clock signal INCLK has a phase approximately equal to the phase of the additional delay clock signal ADS. When &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is decreased, the internal clock signal INCLK has a phase approximately equal to the phase of the normal delay clock signal NDS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The operation of the clock synchronization circuit, when the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK is faster than that of the internal clock signal INCLK, will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Initially, &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is set up to be zero (0) in Formula 1. That is, all of the whole control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN are at a high level, thereby enabling all the driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N to drive the normal delay clock signal NDS, and the whole control signals SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN have a low level, thereby disabling all the driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N to drive the additional delay clock signal ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> outputs the internal clock signal INCLK having the same phase as the normal delay clock signal NDS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This condition is maintained until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is approximate to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK to some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is approximately equal to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK to some extent, &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is gradually increased in Formula 1, so that the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK can be approximately equal to the phase of the additional delay clock signal ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> That is, the number of the enabled driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS is reduced according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the number of the enabled driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS is increased according to the control signals SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The internal clock signal INCLK is outputted with the minutely-increased phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The procedure is repeated until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a situation where (1) the driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS are all disabled; (2) the driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS are all enabled according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; (3) the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the additional delay clock signal ADS; and (4) the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is still faster than that of the buffered clock signal iCLK, the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal CON to shift the shift register <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the left. Accordingly, the first control signal CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is at a high level and the other control signals CSL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-CSLN are at a low level to form a delay path from the first unit delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the last unit delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N, thereby newly outputting the normal delay clock signal NDS and the additional delay clock signal ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the number of the driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS and the number of the driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS are adjusted according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. That is, the internal clock signal INCLK is outputted with the minutely-controlled phase. Such a procedure is repeated until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK is slower than that of the internal clock signal INCLK, &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is set up to be one (1) in Formula 1 in an early stage, and thus the internal clock signal INCLK has the same phase as the additional delay clock signal ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> This condition is maintained until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is approximately equal to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK to some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is approximately equal to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK to some extent, &lsquo;&agr;&rsquo; is gradually decreased in Formula 1, so that the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK can be approximately equal to the phase of the normal delay clock signal NDS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> That is, the number of the enabled driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS is increased according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the number of the enabled driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS is decreased according to the control signals SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The internal clock signal INCLK is outputted with the minutely-decreased phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The procedure is repeated until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When the driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N, for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS, are all enabled and the driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N, for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS, are all disabled according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the normal delay clock signal NDS, if the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is still slower than that of the buffered clock signal iCLK, the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> outputs the control signal CON to shift the shift register <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the right. Accordingly, the third control signal CSL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is at a high level and the other control signals CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CSL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and CSL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-CSLN are at a low level to form a delay path from the third unit delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the last unit delay cell DEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>N, thereby newly outputting the normal delay clock signal NDS and the additional delay clock signal ADS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the number of the driving units <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>N for driving the normal delay clock signal NDS and the number of the driving units <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>N for driving the additional delay clock signal ADS are adjusted according to the control signals SN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SNN and SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-SAN from the control unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. That is, the internal clock signal INCLK is outputted with the minutely-controlled phase. Such a procedure is repeated until the phase of the internal clock signal INCLK is identical to the phase of the buffered clock signal iCLK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a clock synchronization circuit for a semiconductor memory device in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The clock synchronization circuit includes: a receiving unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; a variable delay line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; a delay monitor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>; a phase detecting unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>; a shift register <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>; a phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>; and a control unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The clock synchronization circuit further includes: a duty driving unit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for setting up a level ratio of a mix clock signal MIXCLK from the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>; and a duty cycle control unit <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for controlling the ratio of the duty driving unit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The duty driving unit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> sets up an identical time duration ratio in the high level period and the low level period of the mix clock signal MIXCLK from the phase mixing unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> according to a control signal DSC from the duty cycle control unit <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. That is, the duty driving unit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is driven so that the duty of the duty cycle of the internal clock signal INCLK can be 50%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For example, when the internal clock signal INCLK has a frequency of 500 MHz, if a period of one clock is 2 ns and the duty of the duty cycle is exactly 50%, the high level period and the low level period of the internal clock signal INCLK are ins, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The duty cycle is adjusted because the DDR SRAM is operated both in a rising edge and a falling edge of the clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Except for the above-described operation, the clock synchronization circuit of the second embodiment is operated in the same manner as the clock synchronization circuit of the first embodiment, and thus detailed explanations thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As discussed earlier, in accordance with the present invention, the clock synchronization circuit composed of the digital DLL outputs the clock signal delayed by the variable delay line and the clock signal delayed by the additional delay cell, mixes the two clock signals, and outputs the internal clock signal having a smaller delay than the delay time of the delay cell, thereby rapidly precisely synchronizing the external clock signal and the internal clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the driving unit and the control unit for adjusting the duty cycle are provided to set up a ratio of 50%, thereby improving the operation performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalences of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
