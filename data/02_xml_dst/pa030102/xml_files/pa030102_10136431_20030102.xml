<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawing and specific examples, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figure and specific examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In general, ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of a polymer electrolyte are greatly affected by the degree of crosslinking of a polymer used to form a polymer matrix. When using polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate alone as a polymer to form the polymer matrix, the polymer exhibits a weak mechanical property due to a high degree of crosslinking while having a good ionic conductivity. Therefore, the present invention is directed to a reduction of the degree of crosslinking of a polymer electrolyte by adding a polymer of compounds of polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylates represented by formula 1 and/or multi-functional ethyleneoxides represented by formula 2 with a vinylacetate monomer represented by formula 3, a (meth)acrylate monomer represented by formula 4 or a mixture thereof. As described above, if the degree of crosslinking in the polymer electrolyte is reduced, the mobility of lithium ions at low temperature can be increased and the mechanical properties and processibility of the polymer electrolyte can be improved.

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> wherein R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is H or CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, n is an integer from 1 to 100,000, R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is H or CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is H or CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, an alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and the sum of a and b is 6, in which it is preferred that a is 2 and b is 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A method of preparing a polymer electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The material used to form the polymer matrix is prepared by mixing a polymer of compounds of polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylates represented by formula 1 and/or multi-functional ethyleneoxides represented by formula 2 with one selected from a vinylacetate monomer represented by formula 3, a (meth)acrylate monomer represented by formula 4 and a mixture thereof. The material used to form the polymer matrix is mixed with an electrolytic solution including a lithium salt and an organic solvent, thereby obtaining a composition use to form the polymer electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the polymer electrolyte forming composition, the mixture ratio by weight of the polymer matrix forming material to the electrolytic solution is 1:0.1 to 1:50 according to an aspect of the invention. If the content of the polymer matrix forming material relative to the content of the electrolytic solution exceeds the above range, the mechanical property of the polymer electrolyte film deteriorates and the ionic conductivity characteristic thereof becomes low. If the content of the polymer matrix forming material relative to the content of the electrolytic solution is less than the above range, the reactivities of the precursors used to form the polymer electrolyte film are lowered, making it difficult to obtain the polymer electrolyte film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the material used to form the polymer matrix according to an aspect of the invention, the mixture ratio by weight of the polymer of compounds of polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylates represented by formula 1 and/or multi-functional ethyleneoxides represented by formula 2 to the one selected from a vinylacetate monomer represented by formula 3 and a mixture of a vinylacetate monomer represented by formula 3 and a (meth)acrylate monomer represented by formula 4, is between 1:0.0001 and 0.0001:1, and preferably between 1:0.01 and 0.01:1. If the ratio exceeds the above range, the mechanical property of the polymer electrolyte film deteriorates. If the ratio is less than the above range, the reactivities of the precursors used to form the polymer electrolyte film are lowered, making it difficult to obtain the polymer electrolyte film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate has a weight-average molecular weight of 170 to 4,400,000, and preferably 200 to 100,000. If the weight-average molecular weight exceeds the above range, the mechanical property of a film formed by polymerization of the polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate becomes undesirably weak. In the (meth)acrylate monomer represented by formula 4, R<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is a methyl or ethyl group according to an aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A curing initiator and a curing catalyst are further added to the composition to form the polymer electrolyte according to an aspect of the invention, and mixed to obtain a homogenized solution. However, the curing initiator and/or the curing catalyst need not be used in all aspects of the invention. The curing catalyst is added to improve the curing speed. Examples of the curing catalyst include but are not limited to, one or more amines selected from the group consisting of triethylamine, tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-benzyldimethylamine. The content of the curing catalyst added is in the range of 0.01 to 2.0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer matrix forming material. If the content of the curing catalyst is greater than 2.0 parts by weight, the electrochemical property of the polymer electrolyte deteriorates. If the content of the curing catalyst is less than 0.01 parts by weight, the curing reaction is not carried out smoothly, which is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Usable curing initiators include, but are not limited to, at least one selected from the group consisting of diacyl peroxides such as dibenzoyl peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide and didecanoyl peroxide; dicumyl peroixides; di-t-butylperoxides; dialkyl -peroxides such as 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di)-t-butylperoxy)hexane; peroxy esters such as &agr;-cumyl peroxy-neodecanoate, 1,1-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyl peroxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, t-amylperoxy-benzoate and t-butyl peroxy-pivalate; tertiary alkyl hydroperoxides such as 2,5-dihydroperoxy-2,5-dimethylhexane, cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide; peroxy ketals such as 1,1-di-(t-amylperoxy)-cyclohexane, 2,2-di-(t-butylperoxy)butane and ethyl 3,3-di-(t-butylperoxy)-butylate; peroxydicarbonates such as di(n-propyl) peroxy-dicarbonate, di(sec-butyl) peroxy-dicarbonate and di(2-ethylhexyl)peroxy-dicarbonate; and azos such as azobisisobutyronitrile. The content of the curing initiators is in the range of 0.0001 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer matrix forming material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, when using the multi-functional ethylene oxide polymer represented by formula 2 according to an aspect of the invention, peroxides such as diacyl peroxides, dialkyl peroxides, peroxy esters, peroxy ketals or peroxy dicarbonates, are preferably used as the curing initiator. This is due to the use of a gas forming compound such as azobisisobutyronitrile, which may generate gas that roughens the surface of the polymer electrolyte formed on an electrode plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, the resultant mixture is cast on a support substrate and cured by heat or ultraviolet radiation. The support substrate is a glass substrate or a TEFLON substrate. The curing temperature is in the range of 25 to 85&deg; C., and preferably 60 to 80&deg; C. If the curing temperature is higher than 85&deg; C., volatilization of the liquid electrolyte or decomposition of the lithium salt may result. If the curing temperature is lower than 25&deg; C., the curing reaction may not take place properly. However, it is understood that other support structures and/or temperatures can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the curing is completed, the support substrate is subjected to stripping, thereby obtaining a polymer electrolyte according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the above-described method of preparing the polymer electrolyte, any organic solvent can be used that is generally used in the manufacture of a lithium battery. Examples of the organic solvent include at least one selected from the group consisting of propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate, methylethylcarbonate, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methylhydrofuran, diethoxyethane, methylformate, ethylformate and V-butyrolactone. The content of the organic solvent is in the range of 90 to 99.9 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the electrolytic solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Usable examples of the lithium salt forming the electrolytic solution include at least one selected from the group consisting of LiClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, LiCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and LiN(CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The content of the lithium salt is in the range of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the electrolytic solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the mechanical strength and the performance at the interface with electrodes, additives, such as an adhesion enhancer, a filler or the like, are further added to the polymer electrolyte forming composition according to an aspect of the invention. However, these additives need not be used in all aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> lithium-sulfur battery according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing a positive electrode (i.e., a cathode) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a negative electrode (i.e., an anode) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a separator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> interposed between the positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the negative electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The polymer electrolyte is disposed between the positive and negative electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A method of preparing a lithium battery using the polymer electrolyte according an embodiment of to the present invention will be described. A cathode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an anode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are manufactured by the same method generally used in the manufacture of a lithium battery. Here, a lithium composite oxide, a transition metal compound or a sulfur compound can be used as a cathode active material, and a lithium metal, carbonaceous material or graphite can be used as an anode active material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Then, the thus-prepared polymer electrolyte is interposed between the cathode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the anode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, followed by winding or stacking, to form an electrode assembly. The resultant electrode assembly is put into a battery case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby assembling a battery. Thereafter, an electrolytic solution containing an organic solvent and a lithium salt is injected into the battery case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby completing a lithium battery. The electrolytic solution can be the same or different from that used to prepare the polymer electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Another method of preparing a lithium battery according to another embodiment of the present invention will be described. Like in the above-described preparation method, a composition used to form a polymer electrolyte is first prepared. Separately, a cathode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an anode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are prepared, respectively, in the same manner as described above. Then, a separator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made from an insulating resin having a network structure is interposed between the cathode and the anode, followed by winding or stacking, to form an electrode assembly. The electrode assembly is put into a battery case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby assembling a battery. According to an aspect of the invention, the separator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a single-layered polyethylene or polypropylene separator, a double-layered separator of polyethylene/polypropylene, or a triple-layered separator of polyethylene/polypropylene/ polyethylene or polypropylene/polyethylene/polypropylene. Thereafter, the polymer electrolyte forming composition is injected into the battery case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accommodating the electrode assembly, and thermally treated to perform a polymerization reaction in the battery, thereby completing a lithium battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the above-described preparation method, the thermal treatment temperature is in the range of 20 to 850&deg; C., preferably 60 to 80&deg; C., according to aspects of the invention. The deviation of the thermal treatment temperature from the above range entails the same disadvantage as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described preparation method, a polymer formed by polymerization of unsaturated groups present in the polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate represented by formula 1 or the multi-functional ethyleneoxide compound represented by formula 2, is completely dissolved in the electrolytic solution and gelled at room temperature. In such a manner, a gel-type polymer electrolyte is formed on an insulative resin sheet and a solid polymer electrolyte existing in the network structure of the insulative resin sheet is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the polymer electrolyte coated on the insulative resin sheet having a network structure is in the range of 5 to 90 pm according to an aspect of the invention. The polymer electrolyte has good ionic conductivity within this range of thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The lithium battery according to the present invention is not specifically limited from the viewpoint of type or shape, and the present invention can be applied to both lithium primary batteries and lithium secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described through the following examples. However, the invention is understood to not be limited thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The resultant product was cured at 80&deg; C. for 2 hours, thereby completing a lithium secondary battery. Here, an electrolytic solution obtained by dissolving 1.3 M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>in a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) in the mixture ratio by weight of 3:7 was used as the electrolytic solution. </paragraph>
