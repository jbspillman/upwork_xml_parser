<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A tenant-centric paradigm is applied to the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. Also, an online information management and exchange mechanism, a parallel approach to the process, and a demand-focused scheme may be employed to facilitate the linking of would-be tenants to the real estate of landlords. Tenants are empowered by enabling them to submit project specifications, which include desired characteristics of real estate, outfitting parameters, and a move-in date, which may be in the future. These project specifications may be combined into a real estate demand (aggregation) database, which may be accessed by landlords. Alternatively, a project specification may be submitted directly to landlords, which respond with proposals. These proposals may be combined into an ad hoc real estate supply database to service the tenant that created the project specification. Other embodiments may include, for example, on-line collaboration, information sharing, and document hosting. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to the field of real estate exchange/market(s) and the provisioning thereof, and in particular, by way of example but not limitation, to creating and implementing an efficient and expeditious mechanism for linking tenants with real estate that matches their requested specifications as well as outfitting such real estate with appropriate accouterments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The real estate industry exists, ostensibly, so as to enable would-be tenants to secure leaseholds on real estate owned by landlords (or to purchase real estate from owners). Unfortunately, the current real estate industry is replete with inefficiencies and &ldquo;middlemen&rdquo; that together result in unnecessarily high costs and lengthy delays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary purpose for the real estate industry is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The real estate industry <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, in at least one regard, is intended to enable real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be linked to one or more tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may include, for example, corporations, partnerships, individuals, governmental entities, charitable institutions, etc. Real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include, for example, high, medium, and low rise structures; flexible buildings suitable for, e.g., research and design; industrial complexes and properties; land (e.g., for building to suit); a portion thereof (e.g., a floor, a quadrant, etc.); etc. The tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, as represented by respective real estate departments or liaisons, for example, determine desired characteristics of real estate to be acquired for lease, purchase, etc. The real estate industry <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> endeavors to link a tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to a parcel of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by matching the real estate desires (or at least the minimum requirements) of the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to a piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at an acceptable cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> first conventional real estate linking paradigm is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This traditional paradigm <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that are eventually linked to satisfactory real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Each piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is owned, operated, and/or managed by a landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. In most, especially commercial, real estate environments, each landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is represented by a landlord&apos;s broker (BL) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> while each tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is represented by a tenant&apos;s broker (B<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. In this traditional paradigm <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the power and control is (intentionally or inadvertently) vested in various brokers, who control both the information relevant to any real estate deal as well as the flow of such information and the process undertaken to consummate the transaction, instead of the customer (e.g., the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>) or even the purveyor (e.g., the landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). As indicated by the communication arrows <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the likelihood of a particular tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> having even the opportunity to pursue a particular piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is at least partially dependent on whether the respective brokers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> have knowledge (i) of each other&apos;s existence and business or (ii) of a particular locale or access to a particular proprietary database, which may not be current in any event. The information controlled by the middlemen, the brokers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, includes not only the factual information associated with the attributes of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the desires of the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, but it also includes more intangible knowledge such as what each party will actually accept in a deal. This distribution of intangible knowledge may, if not properly shared and utilized by the brokers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, hinder the completion of a deal, or, on the other hand, it may result in an agreement that is sub-optimal, especially for the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, due to the nature of the broker-to-broker interplay, not only is a portion of any profit from the transaction absorbed by middlemen, but there is a resistance to being able to pursue multiple deals simultaneously, especially if multiple landlord brokers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must be involved in order to pursue the various alternative pieces of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as will be explained in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the organization and inertia of the traditional real estate industry extends the period of time a tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> must endure before a piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is ready for possession and use because the traditional real estate industry adheres to a conventional serialized approach. This conventional serialized approach to securing a piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and subsequently, and only subsequently, outfitting the real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> lengthens the period of time between when a tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> determines the need and appropriateness for expansion and when the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may actually expand into new or larger facilities. This lengthened time period is unfortunately too long to meet the needs of today&apos;s businesses, especially those that must compete at &ldquo;Internet speed&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> second, electronically-based conventional real estate linking paradigm is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Each landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that has real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> available may enter relevant data regarding the real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> into a database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Access to the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is typically provided through an Internet site and server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. A tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> inputs a query that includes a minimal amount of information regarding desired real estate traits (i.e., city, area of town, square footage, and property type) using a terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (i.e., a computer with Internet access). The query is sent from the terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, over the Internet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, and then to the Internet site and server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The Internet site and server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> submits the query to the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Electronic real estate listings that match the minimal information input for the query are extracted from the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and forwarded for display at the terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for review by the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may thereafter select one or more of the displayed properties for further consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this first-generation Internet paradigm <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the power and control is vested primarily in the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and the Internet site and server <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. However, some control, and hence some power, is also vested in the landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> inasmuch as the landlords are empowered to present their real estate to tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> without necessarily relying on one or more brokers. However, the customer in the real estate environment, the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, still has no direct control of the real estate selection and acquisition process. Another drawback to this approach is that the data in the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> rapidly and frequently becomes outdated. The tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> therefore has little certainty, and definitely no guarantee, as to whether or not any particular real estate forwarded to the terminal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is still available. Moreover, the tenant is unable to plan for the future inasmuch as the data in the database of real estate that is currently available <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> only includes listings of real estate that is presently on the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> conventional real estate acquisition and outfitting process is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The time line <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> indicates a project initiation time <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and a project completion time <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The duration between the project initiation time <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and the project completion time <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is typically <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> months using the conventional linear approach. (It should be noted that the various phases in the time line <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are not necessarily drawn to relative scales with respect to each other.) An initial real estate phase <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> overlaps an analysis phase <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> only slightly. While a due diligence phase <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> is frequently started during the analysis phase <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, subsequent design sub-phases of programming <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and development <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> are only started and completed in a serial fashion. Furthermore, a bidding/estimation/value engineering phase <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, a construction phase <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>, and a relocation phase <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are also carried out in a serial manner after the development design sub-phase <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> is completed. Each of the bidding/estimation/value engineering phase <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the construction phase <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>, and the relocation phase <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is only started after the respective previous phase is completed, which causes the above-noted completion time of <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> months. As noted hereinabove, such a time period is too long to meet the needs of today&apos;s businesses, especially those that must compete at &ldquo;Internet speed&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In short, conventional real estate paradigms have heretofore failed to empower the tenant-customer to control the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. Furthermore, the process to which the tenant-customer is subjected is fraught with delays intrinsic to the traditional serialized approach to this process as well as frustrations from other inherent inefficiencies. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The deficiencies of existing paradigms and approaches are overcome by the methods, systems, arrangements, and electronic transactions of the present invention. For example, as heretofore unrecognized, it would be beneficial to institute a tenant-centric paradigm for the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. In fact, it would also be beneficial if this tenant-centric paradigm involved an online information management and exchange mechanism, a parallel approach to the outfitting process, and a demand-focused selection and acquisition scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention in various embodiments is directed to real estate exchange, real estate markets, etc. In certain embodiment (s), a tenant-centric paradigm enables the customer in the real estate environment to control, guide, and drive the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. As a result, the likelihood of a would- be tenant securing an optimal piece of real estate in a timely manner is significantly increased. Furthermore, costs can be reduced (i) as middlemen may be optionally excluded from the process, (ii) as information is made available to the tenant-customer, (iii) as traditional delays are reduced or eliminated, (iv) as traditional &ldquo;dead ends&rdquo; are avoided, etc. Moreover, the time from when a determination by the tenant-customer of desired real estate characteristics is made to a time when such desired characteristics are made available for move-in and utilization is significantly reduced by automating the real estate acquisition and outfitting process as well as by orchestrating the performance of certain phases in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiment (s), a demand-pull type market for real estate is created using, for example, an online mechanism. The demand-pull type market may entail a database that includes, for example, data items associated with a collection of real estate characteristics (e.g., as part of an overall project requirements specification) desired by a tenant either currently or in the future. This list of characteristics may be associated with, inter alia, a time, which may be in the future, at which the desired characteristics will be needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This database, in certain embodiment(s), may be accessed and searched by landlords so as to enable them to determine whether there are any tenant-customers whose real estate needs they may be able to meet. After determining a target project requirements specification that they may be able to meet, the various landlords may thereafter bid in which they submit (e.g., in an on-line, standardized proposal format) to the tenant-customer their best offer to satisfy or meet the project requirement specifications, and other intangibles, of the tenant-customer. This database, in accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, may therefore also be instrumental in producing a demand-pull type marketplace for real estate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), project requirement specifications of a would-be tenant may be compared to a database that includes entries directed to a real estate supply of various landlords. When one or more successful matches are determined, the corresponding landlords are notified so that they may, at their option, prepare a bid proposal to the would-be tenant. Alternatively, the matches that result from the comparison may be returned to the would-be tenant for analysis and review. The review may entail access to detailed information regarding the real estate matches, including, e.g., the associated amenities and a virtual on-line tour. The tenant consequently has the ability to narrow the list of matches to a preferred list. Landlords corresponding to the matches on the preferred list may subsequently be sent requests for a proposal (RFPs). Such proposals, which advantageously may be required to adhere to a standardized format for the convenience of the tenant-customer, that are produced by landlords on the preferred list may be analyzed and/or considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), landlords (i) may only be given access to the aforementioned tenant-centric demand database, (ii) may only have their corresponding entries in the real estate supply database be compared to project requirement specifications, and/or (iii) may only have their corresponding entries in the real estate supply database available for direct searching or perusal by others (e.g., would-be tenant-customers) if and only if the landlord has updated all such corresponding entries in the real estate supply database within a prescribed period of time and/or at least once during each prescribed interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), a quasi-spot market is created to service a particular demand-driven transaction. A would-be tenant provides a project requirements specification for a desired real estate transaction. Pertinent aspects of the information in the project requirements specification are extracted and provided to multiple landlords for their consideration. Each of the multiple landlords may review the pertinent aspects of the desired real estate transaction to determine whether or not they have the real estate resources to meet the specified requirements. For those landlords that decide in the affirmative, data related to relevant pieces of real estate is provided. The data from various responding landlords is provided by them and combined into an ad hoc real estate supply database for use in servicing the particular desired real estate transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), different phases from conception and specification of project requirements to final completion of the outfitting process are overlapped using, for example, an online mechanism. For instance, project requirement specifications from the would-be tenant may be forwarded to appropriate expertise for the outfitting process. This expertise may include, for example, companies equipped to handle design, engineering, information technology, and/or other build-out aspects for readying a space for ultimate move-in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), landlords may be permitted to access (in addition to general entries in a real estate demand database) entries corresponding to projects/deals that are in the process of being completed and/or agreed to. In such cases, landlords have the option of requesting to be included in the list of possible real estate providers by submitting an unsolicited response to a request for information (RFI), which typically has less information than a request for proposal (RFP). The landlords may be given the opportunity to review on-going projects/deals as an optional part of certain embodiment(s) that involve on-line collaboration between various parties in the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. This on-line collaboration may further facilitate a parallel approach to the process in which various phases are advantageously overlapped in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also in certain embodiment(s), document (e.g., real estate related document) hosting on-line enables near any-time, anywhere access to documents being used in the real estate selection, acquisition, and outfitting process. Benefits of the document hosting embodiment(s) may be synergistically increased by combining them with on-line collaboration embodiment(s). In further embodiment(s), lease administration may be seamlessly integrated with on-line mechanisms in accordance with the present invention. Lease administration embodiment(s) may be combined with, for example, real estate demand (aggregation) database embodiment(s) by presently, e.g., &ldquo;posting&rdquo; leases that will expire in the future at the behest of the landlord or tenant. In still further embodiment (s), access to various information collected by the on-line mechanism may be exchanged for value with other parties both during actual individual projects/deals/transactions and as statistical summaries after effectuating multiple such projects/deals/transactions. In yet still further embodiment(s), agreements (e.g., those that are real estate-related) may be created on-line by selecting or deleting various provisions from a collection of provisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The above-described and other features/embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail hereinafter with reference to the illustrative examples shown in the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that those skilled in the art will appreciate that the described embodiments are provided for purposes of illustration and understanding and that numerous equivalent embodiments are contemplated herein. Also, it should be understood that the various embodiments of the present invention as described herein may be combined to create still other embodiments.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular computer systems, flow charts, logic modules (implemented in, for example, software, hardware, firmware, some combination thereof, etc.), techniques, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an exemplary, tenant-centric paradigm for the real estate industry in accordance with the present invention, is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. In contradistinction to existing paradigms of the real estate industry, the principles of the present invention advantageously adopt a tenant-centric paradigm. The tenant is the central focus of the structure, management, and work flow in this tenant-centric paradigm. In the organizational diagram <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, a set of concentric circles have at their center tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The remainder of the real estate industry revolves around the tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> in order to best meet their needs. The tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> initiate a real estate inquiry by completing a project requirements specification (PRS) <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be input, for example, using an on-line mechanism. Each PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> includes data related to the identity, needs, and desires of the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. This data includes, for example, client name, date inquiry initiated, date real estate desired, target square footage, building class, parking requirements, generic special requirements, general manager (e.g., for construction), broker, design firm contact, all project contacts, move-in date needed, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As indicated by the dashed-line circle for the tenants&apos; brokers <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, the tenants&apos; brokers may optionally be included in the process. While not required in accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, a would-be tenant may feel more comfortable using a broker that is familiar with the targeted locale and/or may have a history with a broker that understands the would-be tenant&apos;s preferences. The on-line mechanism may be employed to convert the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to a request for proposal (RFP) <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. An electronic transmission is sent to each of multiple landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, each of which is associated with one or more pieces of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The electronic transmission may be sent to the multiple landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> using, for example, an electronic mail (e.g., e-mail) format. The electronic transmission notifies the landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the RFP <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and may optionally provide instructions and/or directions (e.g., one or more links to a web site page or pages) for and/or to accessing and viewing/retrieving the RFP <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the RFP <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be sent directly to each of the multiple landlords using, for example, an electronic transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As indicated by the dashed-line circle for the landlords&apos; brokers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the landlords&apos; brokers may optionally be included in the process. While not required in accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, landlords may elect to rely on a broker to facilitate and streamline communications. Each landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that receives the RFP <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> decides whether or not to respond thereto. Those landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that are interested in providing a solution to the would-be tenant&apos;s <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> real estate needs prepare a proposal (e.g., proposals P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . P<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. The would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that originally prepared the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is notified of the one or more proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> using, for example, an electronic transmission (e.g., electronic mail, etc.). The electronic transmission may optionally provide instructions and/or directions (e.g., one or more links to a web site page or pages) for and/or to accessing and viewing/retrieving the one or more proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the one or more proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> may be sent directly to the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> using, for example, an electronic transmission. The proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> may also be prepared and forwarded by the landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> using an on-line mechanism. The PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, the RFP <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, etc. may be formatted in a standardized manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the system may combine information from other (e.g., earlier) parts of the transaction/transfer process into a single file. For example, proposal and financial information for all of the buildings selected by the would-be tenant as &ldquo;finalists&rdquo; can be combined, with their respective information from the RFI/RFP dialogue and exchange(s), into the single file using an automated process. The file may then be converted into a more standard format, such as MS Word and WordPerfect. Advantageously, the converted file format may then be easily modified and fine-tuned for final presentation, or for other manipulation. Notably, when a transaction is near culmination (or after), a summary document with final terms and conditions can be created by the system. The information in the summary document may then be provided to a lease management/administration program. For example, in addition to the terms and conditions, contact information and reminders (e.g., those derived from the terms and conditions) may be imported to the lease management/administration easily and automatically because the lease transaction side of the system may be coupled to the lease management/administration &ldquo;side,&rdquo; although they may actually be separate programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an exemplary real estate linking scheme in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The real estate linking scheme <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may include a real estate demand database (or, more generally, a data structure) <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and a real estate supply database (or, more generally, a data structure) <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. A would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may complete a PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> using, for example, an on-line mechanism. In other words, the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may fill out a form on a web page and then submit the form to a centralized or distributed repository (e.g., a web site). It should be noted that other means to enter the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> information into an electronic format may alternatively be used. After many (or at least two) PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> have been received, they may be amalgamated into the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. The real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> thus serves to aggregate both present and future real estate demand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, each of which is associated with one or more pieces of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, prepare an entry for each piece of real estate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that they want entered into the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Each entry includes details regarding real estate that is or will be available, such as landlord identity, square footage, availability time frame, building type, building location, amenities offered, number of parking spaces, etc. A landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may complete such an entry using, for example, a on-line mechanism. In other words, the landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may fill out a form on a web page and then submit the form to the web site, for example. It should be noted that other means to convert entry information into an electronic format may alternatively be used. After many (or at least two) such real estate entries have been received, they may be amalgamated into the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> thus serves to aggregate both present and future real estate supply. As indicated by the &ldquo;cloud-like&rdquo; appearance of the lower portion of the illustration of the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, at least a portion of the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be in flux and/or be built/established on an ad hoc basis. An ad hoc real estate supply database may be formed of entries that are provided by landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in response to a particular PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Consequently, an ad hoc real estate supply database is formed responsive to the needs of an individual would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and by landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that are interested in meeting those needs. Such an ad hoc real estate supply database is described further hereinbelow with particular references to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> can be populated using information on known real estate in a geographic area, regardless of whether there is any currently known availability in such real estate. In this embodiment, the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> can include base building data that rarely changes, such as the size of the building, the location, the year in which the building was built, who represents the building (i.e., leasing agent), and other permanent or semi-permanent facts about the building. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Once the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> has been established, searching and viewing access <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> may be provided to would-be tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> via, for example, an on-line mechanism such as a web site. In accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may advantageously be provided with searching, viewing, etc. access <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> to the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. This access may be accomplished, for example, via an on-line mechanism such as a web site. This access enables landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to analyze the current and future needs of various tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and to attempt to meet them. As a result, multiple landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are likely to be exposed to a given tenant&apos;s <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, which exposure increases the likelihood that the tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> will receive multiple competing proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, a comparison function/unit/software program <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> may access both the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> in order to find matches between the PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and the entries from landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. Entries from the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> that appear to meet the requirements enumerated in a particular PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> may be forwarded as matching results <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> to the corresponding would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. These matching results <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> may be forwarded, for example, in a standardized electronic format via e-mail. The would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may then investigate the real estate corresponding to the matching entries before selecting a number of entries for further consideration. The further consideration may include, for example, sending RFPs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to the landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that correspond to the selected entries. The comparison feature <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> may also compare each PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> to a particular entry of the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> that appear to be satisfiable by the particular entry are forwarded as matching results <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> to the corresponding landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The matching results <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> may be forwarded, for example, in a standardized electronic format via e-mail. The landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may review the received PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and submit a proposal to each would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that had entered a PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> for which the landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is able to satisfy the requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In cases where the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> includes all or substantially all of the potential real estate in an area, potential tenants can identify real estate that might meet the criteria in the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> even before the real estate is publicly known to have availability and/or before the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is updated to indicate availability. The tenant can then forward the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to the landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the identified real estate. This increases the number of matches for potential space and can provide the potential tenant with a head-start on other potential tenants in cases where future availability is not publicly known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form for linking tenants to real estate in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>B, respectively. In accordance with the tenant-centric paradigm and demand-focused scheme of the present invention, the prospective tenant enters a project requirements specification (PRS) (step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>). The PRS may be entered using, for example, a web site form. The PRS may be added to a real estate demand database (step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>). Such a real estate demand database may be composed of a data structure with multiple PRSs indexed and linked appropriately in order to facilitate searching, access, retrieval, etc. The entered PRS may be compared to each entry in a real estate supply database (step <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>). The comparison will ordinarily result in one or more matches (step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>). In this context, a match may imply that the entry of the real estate supply database holds or indicates a potential to meet the requirements set forth in the PRS. The one or more matches may then be presented to the would-be tenant that entered the PRS (step <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> These one or more matches may be presented to the would-be tenant via, for example, e-mail with links to web site locations that include further descriptions and/or the ability to take virtual tours of the real estate. The matching results can also be presented in the form of a report that allows corresponding fields from different matching entries to be easily compared, thereby facilitating the tenant&apos;s selection and ranking process. The tenant reviews the presented entries and selects one or more entries that correspond to potentially desirable real estate (e.g., preferred real estate) (step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>). Requests for proposals (RFPs) are sent to the landlords that correspond to the preferred real estate (step <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>). Those landlords that are interested in meeting the needs of the would-be tenant prepare a proposal. The proposals from the various interested landlords are sent to the would-be tenant (step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>). Again, this communication of proposals may be effectuated using an on-line mechanism such as e-mail, and the information in and the layout of each proposal may be standardized in the e-mail (or its attachment(s)) to facilitate side-by-side comparisons. From these proposals, the would-be tenant selects a primary (and optionally a secondary, tertiary, etc.) real estate option (step <highlight><bold>745</bold></highlight>). This selection may also be accomplished via e-mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After a would-be tenant selects at least a primary real estate option, the would-be tenant ordinarily receives an on- site (actual) tour of the selected real estate option(s), which can be efficiently scheduled using an on-line mechanism such as e-mail that is facilitated by the real estate transaction system. The would-be tenant visits, views, and appraises the selected real estate option(s). Afterwards, the would-be tenant may elect to rate and/or memorialize comments regarding the toured real estate property or properties. In accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention, the would-be tenant records their ratings and comments via an on-line mechanism. For example, the would-be tenant may access a web site page that lists relevant questions for rating the toured property and/or includes blanks for entering comments. These ratings and comments are combined with those of other tenants and would-be tenants that have likewise taken tours of such respective real estate properties. The combined data (e.g., organized and amalgamated by real estate property, by landlord for services and responsiveness, etc.) may be subsequently provided to other would-be tenants, for example, during an initial searching and reviewing session, along with a listing of matching real estate, in conjunction with one or more proposals, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After a would-be tenant enters a PRS (at step <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>), the PRS may, instead of or in addition to being entered into a full database, be presented directly to landlords. While the PRS is preferably entered or transferred into an electronic format, multiple PRSs need not necessarily be combined into a single true database (as in step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) in this embodiment (which focuses on steps <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>755</bold></highlight>). After accepting the PRS from the would be tenant, an on-line mechanism for example, presents the PRS to landlords (step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>). The PRS may be presented to all landlords that are registered by, for example, (i) posting the PRS for review by all of the landlords or (ii) sending the PRS to all landlords via, e.g., e-mail. Alternatively, relevant landlords may be ascertained using, for example, a comparison feature, and the PRS may be broadcast to these relevant landlords by e-mail, for example. The landlords that receive the PRS have the opportunity to review it and consider whether or not they have the ability to meet the specified requirements. In other words, the landlords may identify and indicate their interest in responding to the PRS (step <highlight><bold>755</bold></highlight>). This interest may be presented through the on-line mechanism. Thereafter, entries of the interested landlords may be presented as potential matches to the would-be tenant (at step <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>), or proposals from the interested landlords may be sent to the would-be tenant (at step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, certain aspects of an exemplary on-line mechanism in accordance with the present invention are illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The exemplary on-line mechanism <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> reflects a computer network implementation in which the various participants communicate by way of the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. It should be understood, however, that other communications networks can instead be used. The would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> prepares a PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and inputs, transmits, or otherwise communicates the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> using a communication station <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>. The communication station <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an e-mail enabled pager, a network server, any other device with access to the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, etc. The PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> can be completed off-line and then uploaded as one file, can be completed in real-time by entering information into a form displayed on a web browser from a web site, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A web site transmitting the, e.g. web-enabled, form to the communication station <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> over the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may be operated by or termed a real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. The real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> is responsible for creating, amending, maintaining, etc. the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&prime; and the ad hoc real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&Prime;. These various databases may be stored in, for example, high capacity storage facilities (e.g., non-volatile memory, redundant arrays of independent disks (RAIDs), etc.) behind a protective firewall, for example. The real estate facilitator also stores and disseminates the various forms <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> for implementing the principles of the present invention. The various forms <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> may be standardized to simplify completion, review, and both manual and electronic comparisons thereof. Communications (e.g., RFPs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>) to and from the landlord <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may also be effectuated over the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> via a communication station <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that other electronic transmission possibilities besides electronic mail are embraced by the scope of the present invention. For example, electronic transmission may also include file transfer protocol (FTP), chat (e.g., room) technology, bulletin board posting, web page down/uploading, instant messaging, any general data/information encapsulation into an electronically-transmittable format, equivalents thereof, etc. It should be noted that two entities <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> are also illustrated as being connected to/in communication with the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. Each entity <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> may correspond to the or an important entity of one or more phases of a real estate acquisition and outfitting process, as is described further hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition, at least one entity <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> may support the principles of the present invention with respect to real estate subleases. The sublease entity or module serves to make available sublease space accessible to potential tenants and is therefore included in searches for available space made by would-be tenants <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In this regard, the entries in the sublease module are treated as &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; buildings. In addition, the entries have easy expiration and renewal of listings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an exemplary real estate demand database in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. The exemplary real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> includes multiple PRSs (PRS<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . PRS<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>). Each PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> includes information related to real estate desired by the would be tenant. For example, a PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may include (i) characteristics of the real estate, (ii) a time frame at which or by which the real estate needs to be ready for build out and/or move in, and/or (iii) desired outfitting attributes. With reference to Table 1 below, a would-be tenant may be asked the following questions in accordance with the present invention. Answers to these exemplary questions of Table 1 may constitute all or a portion of the corresponding PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> may be merely composed of multiple PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, but in alternative embodiment(s), greater flexibility is provided by the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> when related fields of different PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> are cross-linked (and/or categorized and/or organized) by field <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> to facilitate comparisons (e.g., to entries in the real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>). Improved searching speed and effectiveness may also be established by indexing the PRSs <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> for searching <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an exemplary on-line mechanism for creating an ad hoc real estate supply database in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. A would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> transmits a PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> (e.g., over the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>) to a real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. The real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>, after processing the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, forwards information provided in the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> over the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and to multiple targeted landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 . . . n </subscript></highlight>as indicated by the combination arrow <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and the separate arrows <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 . . . n</subscript></highlight>. The information included in the messages represented by the arrows <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 . . n </subscript></highlight>indicates to the landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> the presented needs (or demands) of the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Each message may list certain requirements and/or ask whether the landlord can meet them. For example, the message may ask whether the landlord will have &ldquo;X&rdquo; square feet available in a type &ldquo;Y&rdquo; building at time &ldquo;Z&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The landlords <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 . . . n </subscript></highlight>formulate responses and transmit them to the real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> over the Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> as represented by the arrows <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 . . . n </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>. The responses may include those in the negative and those in the affirmative. For the latter, the response may include a listing of one or more pieces of real estate and their associated attributes for eventual consideration by the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> receives the responses and uses them to form an ad hoc real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&Prime;. This ad hoc real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&Prime; is formed effectively to service the needs (demands) of the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and is tantamount to the creation of a spot market. Either individual entries or the whole of the ad hoc real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&Prime; may be sent to the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> for review and consideration. The principles of the present invention thereby enable the building of an ad hoc real estate supply database <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>&Prime; on a deal-by-deal basis for the creation of a quasi-spot market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form for creating an ad hoc real estate supply database in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the demand-focused scheme of certain embodiment (s) of the present invention, a would-be tenant initiates the process by completing and submitting a PRS (step <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>). A real estate facilitator processes the PRS (step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>). The processing may entail preparing the included information for e-mailing; reformatting the included information into a format more amenable to a landlord&apos;s perspective by removing, amending, re-arranging information; extracting the most relevant information for an initial e-mailing, etc. The processed PRS is sent to multiple landlords (step <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight>). The landlords analyze the requirements of the PRS in light of applicable real estate with which they are affiliated (step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Each landlord determines whether or not they are (at least potentially) able to meet the specified requirements (step <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight>). If not, then the landlord may elect to respond in the negative or to not respond at all (step <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>). If, on the other hand, the landlord determines that they are possibly able to meet the specified requirements (and the landlord is interested in doing so), the landlord sends an affirmative response (step <highlight><bold>1135</bold></highlight>). In the affirmative response or a subsequent message, the landlord sends relevant information detailing real estate that is or that will be available at the requested time to the real estate facilitator. The received real estate information from the various landlords is incorporated into an ad hoc real estate supply database (step <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>). The ad hoc real estate supply database may be used to meet the requirements stipulated in the tenant&apos;s PRS (step <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an exemplary real estate acquisition and outfitting process in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> indicates a project initiation time <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, a close-on-land/sign-lease time <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a move-in time <highlight><bold>1215</bold></highlight>, and a project completion time <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The duration between the project initiation time <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> and the project completion time <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is typically 9-13 months when applying principles in accordance with certain embodiment(s) of the present invention. (It should be noted that the various phases in the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> are not necessarily drawn to relative scales with respect to each other.) The exemplary real estate acquisition and outfitting process time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> indicates that various phases may be accomplished in parallel. For example, the real estate <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>, analysis <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, due diligence <highlight><bold>1235</bold></highlight>, programming design <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>, development design <highlight><bold>1245</bold></highlight>, and bidding/estimation/value engineering <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> phases all overlap in time to at least some extent. Furthermore, the construction phase <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> and the relocation phase <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> likewise overlap the bidding/estimation/value engineering <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> phase to at least some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The parallel approach to real estate acquisition and outfitting process time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> indicates that multiple phases, to varying degrees and amounts, are accomplished simultaneously. While there may be increased risk, the advantages for the tenant to-be from the reduction in time to 9-13 months from project initiation <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> to project completion <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> justify the risk. This parallel approach is achieved, and the accompanying risks are managed and/or minimized, by using an on-line mechanism such as the exemplary on-line mechanism <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), at least in part. The exemplary on-line mechanism <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may also include entities <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> (e.g., builders, engineers, architects, interior designers, information technology planners, general contractors, etc.) connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> (e.g., the associated with and/or part of the real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> entity <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>&Prime;, the separate therefrom entity <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>&prime;, etc.) that are pertinent to the completion of the phases <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>. By promptly providing to them, via the on-line mechanism <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, information related to the relevant real estate transaction (e.g., the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>), as well as subsequent changes thereto and/or updates thereof, phases <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> can be started while previous respective phases are still being accomplished/completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Changes to/for/in one phase that affect other phases, and therefore the entities pertinent thereto, may be promptly notified via the on-line mechanism <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, information ascertained and/or decisions made for one entity in one phase may be shared with other entities in other phases promptly. Moreover, in addition to sharing information/data via electronic point-to-point communications (e.g., e-mail), the information/data relevant to a particular real estate transaction may be posted and maintained in one location and/or by one entity (e.g., the real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>) for access, review, and possibly modification by other pertinent entities under appropriate security measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The parallel approach to the real estate acquisition and outfitting process as indicated by the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> may be enabled, at least in part, by integrating the various phases illustrated in the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> using on-line collaboration and/or document hosting. On-line collaboration between the would-be tenant, the landlord, designers, architects, contractors, cablers, brokers (if any), etc. is facilitated by sharing general project information and project schedules as well as by permitting the parties to participate in on-going dialogues together on-line. Document hosting may function as an on-line filing cabinet for documents related to the real estate acquisition and outfitting project. These documents may include, for example, the PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, the RFPs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the proposals <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>, lease documents, due diligence documents, design plans, engineering plans, construction plans, other contracts, etc. Document hosting, in certain embodiment(s), may be understood by analogizing it to providing an organized and flexible on-line filing cabinet, with the manual filing being replaced by down-loading and up-loading of documents. Preferably, all of the documents and information relating to a particular real estate transaction are associated with a &ldquo;project&rdquo; in the system. In this manner, the system can easily determine which items are associated with one another and/or with a particular tenant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the lease (or sale) transaction platform as provided by the real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> may be coupled to a time-line (e.g., &ldquo;Gant&rdquo; chart)-producing module. The scheduling and other information from the lease transaction platform may be electronically (and/or automatically) ported into the time-line producing software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Such a timeline-producing module can automatically produce an estimated schedule based on either a standard template or a &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; (i.e., accelerated) template. Alternatively, a schedule can be uploaded into the real estate transaction management system or can be created within the system from a blank schedule. The timeline schedule can subsequently be accessed by or provided to the various project members to keep everyone on track and to track progress toward completion. Moreover, the module can provide automatic milestone notifications to project members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> may be stored at the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to enable access to the documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> to anyone with appropriate authorization. For example, the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may access the documents for its project(s) from anywhere with Internet <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> access. It should be noted that the documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> may alternatively be stored at another physical or logical location, including a private network, for example. These documents can include important lease documents, floor plans, images, design drawings, etc. Document hosting thus provides virtually anytime, anywhere access to the documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> by the would be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The document database <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> can allow persons with appropriate security access to make revisions to documents and will track document changes by, for example, storing documents in multiple versions. Moreover, the document database <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> can keep relevant members of a project informed through &ldquo;subscriptions,&rdquo; wherein changed documents are automatically forwarded to appropriate project members to alert them as to the changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, multiple different types of documents may be used in connection with the document hosting capability of the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. For example, proprietary documents, &ldquo;Company Documents&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Project Documents&rdquo; may be included and organized in the Document database <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. The proprietary documents may be templates that any user(s) of the system may download and use, and &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo; may be personal to an individual user, while &ldquo;Company Documents&rdquo; may be accessible to all individuals associated with a given company in the system, and &ldquo;Project Documents&rdquo; may be accessible by all individuals that are associated with a particular project in the system. Notably, each set of document type(s) may be assigned a specific security level that a user must possess for that folder and document type in order to be able to access the document. Exemplary security divisions include project guest, project member, and (project) administrator. A project member may be given access to only those documents that pertain to the member&apos;s role in the project while the project administrator may have access to a larger set of documents. If a person is not part of a particular project or company, then files related to that particular project or company are inaccessible and/or are not presented to that person with the document manager. A similar setup may be instituted if a person does not have sufficient security clearance for a project, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Document hosting can optionally be combined with on-line collaboration when, for example, the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> permits/grants authorization to other parties to the project to view, amend, comment on, etc. one or more of the documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. The RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> can optionally grant such authorization only upon permission from the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The authorization may extend to all of the documents <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, or it may alternatively only extend to relevant documents. For example, an entity whose responsibility is limited to electrical and mechanical outfitting of the leased space may be permitted to view, amend, comment on, etc. documents such as schedules and engineering and design plans while not being granted authorization to even view the details of the actual lease agreement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> On-line collaboration thus enables multiple parties to access a document and then, optionally, do something on that document that the other parties may also view. The multiple parties are therefore working on the document together. It should be understood that parties (e.g., to a real estate acquisition and outfitting project) may collaborate on-line about other things in addition to, or instead of, documents. For example, an entity such as the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> may provide an on-line project management system by which project management may be affected and effectuated by multiple parties. Thus, on-line collaboration may be practiced without requiring true document hosting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> To facilitate on-line collaboration and communications between and among the various parties to a real estate transaction or project, the real estate facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> can support pre-established communication types, via the forms database <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, for example. The pre-established communication types can include &ldquo;change request,&rdquo; &ldquo;correspondence,&rdquo; proposal history,&rdquo; &ldquo;RFI response history,&rdquo; and &ldquo;submittal.&rdquo;Each communication type can include a plurality of information fields that can be used for that communication type. One or more of the fields can be designated as &ldquo;required&rdquo; for a particular communication type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Among the fields of the communication types can also be an &ldquo;Assign To&rdquo; field. While a system in accordance with the present invention may incorporate a communication scheme in which all admitted members/enrolled participants/etc. (e.g., for a particular project) are notified of new communications (e.g., by an e-mail to their respective e-mail boxes), which they may view by logging into a web-based site, the &ldquo;Assign To&rdquo; enables a communication initiator to designate who has the responsibility to respond to the communication being initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> New communication types, in addition to those noted above, can also be defined by site users. A user might select a name for the new communication type (e.g., &ldquo;Meeting Minutes&rdquo;) and select from a list of default fields that can be included in the new communication type. Custom fields can also be configured after they are established in a &ldquo;New Field Setup&rdquo; area, which allows users to define the parameters (e.g., name/question, question type, input type, whether an answer is required, etc.) of the custom field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, the system facilitates centralized communication between project members and provides a mechanism for tracking communication history. Moreover, the communication management allows for &ldquo;ball in court&rdquo; tracking, which keeps project members informed when they are currently responsible for providing input, answering questions, or responding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form for participating in an on-line collaboration in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. After an RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> or similar entity has established a repository for documents and/or other things for which collaboration is desired, a party A up-loads a document, for example (step <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>). The document may be composed of an engineering and architectural design that the would-be tenant <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (party A) has approved. Party B (e.g., a subcontractor charged with implementing all or a portion of the design), who procures or has procured authorization to access documents for this project of party A, views and/or down-loads the design document (step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>). The subcontractor determines that changes need to be made. For example, the designers and engineers may have selected a particular material that is not permitted under the local codes, and the subcontractor, who is more familiar with the local codes, is able to identify this problem quickly and early. The subcontractor (party B) therefore amends/augments the design document (step <highlight><bold>1315</bold></highlight>) by substituting the permitted material into the specifications of the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After amending/augmenting the design document, the party B returns the amended/augmented document to the repository by up-loading it (step <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>). The RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> advantageously keeps copies (e.g., a record) of all versions of all documents, schedules, etc. so that a history of the project is available for review as necessary and so that a previous version of a document may be retrieved and restored as the current version if needed. It should be noted that the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> may also keep a log that links changes to documents and identifies the party responsible for the changes. As indicated by the example described above with reference to the flowchart <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, the greater communication between the various parties of the real estate acquisition and outfitting process afforded by on-line collaboration enables the parallel approach exhibited by the programming and development design phases <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1245</bold></highlight>, the bidding/estimation/value engineering phase <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>, and the construction phase <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> (of the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, with respect to step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, documents (or more generally files) that need special viewing software (e.g., a computer-aided drawing (CAD) viewer) may be down-loaded along with the document. With respect to step <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, party B may optionally have the ability to elect to notify other (e.g., relevant) parties to the project that a document has been amended/augmented. For example, all parties may be notified by, for example, e-mail. Alternatively, only those parties affected by the changes (e.g., the would-be tenant, the landlord, the engineers and architectural designers in the above-described example) may be contacted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In general with regard to on-line collaboration, communications between and among parties to a project may be launched from a, e.g., web site of the RE facilitator. Such communications may be tracked throughout the life of the communication as different communication threads of the project. When communications are started or added to (or when files are amended/augmented), at least three options may be implemented with respect to &ldquo;notifying&rdquo; other project parties. For example, it may be required that each interested party must access the on-line mechanism to be informed of the changes. Alternatively, all or relevant parties may be notified via an electronic transmission. The electronic transmission may notify the recipient that changes have occurred to the project, may notify the recipient that specific files have been changed, may notify the recipient of the actual changes, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On-line collaboration thus enables a pro-active integration of the various phases (and the relevant parties of the various phases) of the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) from beginning the leasing process (e.g., the project initiation <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>) to the final move-in (e.g., the project completion <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>). Communication and information exchange is tracked and made visible; changes (e.g., change orders) are posted and reviewable/approvable by relevant parties. The on-line collaboration can serve as a project bulletin board to record past and on-going interactions, comments, discussions, etc. On-line collaboration in conjunction with document hosting enables the storing and collaboration of documents and other files. The on-line collaboration, with or without document hosting, can be instrumental (while not necessary in all embodiment (s)) in providing a seamless integration and flow between the various phases of the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Embodiment(s) of the on-line mechanism in accordance with the present invention advantageously facilitate the parallel progression of the project through the various phases <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> by sharing access and the ability to modify project files. The progression of the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> from project initiation <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> to project completion <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is further expedited by sharing particular data from one phase to a subsequent (or preceding) phase. For example, certain information, some of which is collected during the real estate phase <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> (and perhaps with the initial PRS <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>), may be shared and/or forwarded to one or more parties that are wholly or primarily involved in a phase subsequent to the phase in which the information is collected. The following data, in any combination, is exemplary of such information that may be shared/forwarded to other phases in the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>: (1) project name, description, start date and required move-in date; (2) (would-be) tenant name and other info; (3) property address, square footage, age, floor number(s), number of floors, parking requirements, pictures and images of the interior and exterior of the building; (4) proposal financial data including lease term, rent, etc.; (5) lease agreement and letter of intent documents; (6) project schedule; (7) project member information (names of members of the projects such as the general manager/general contractor, subcontractors, brokers, design firm(s), etc.); etc. At least the majority of this information is determined and attained during the real estate phase <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>, and it may advantageously be passed on to parties involved entirely or primarily in other phases <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> of the time line <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> via an on-line mechanism, including an on-line collaboration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form of an alternative embodiment for creating an ad hoc real estate supply database in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. The flowchart <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) addresses tenant submission of a PRS (at step <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>), processing of the PRS (at step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>), and sending of the PRS to multiple landlords (at step <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight>). The flowchart <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> illustrates an alternative for selecting which landlords are sent the PRS. When a would-be tenant accesses the, e.g., web site of the RE facilitator for the first time for a given leasing need and/or situation, the would-be tenant creates a project (step <highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight>). The would-be tenant, knowing certain minimum requirements or expectations such as desired area of town, building type, etc., reviews a listing of buildings (or, more generally, real estate) that might meet the would-be tenant&apos;s requirements and/or expectations (step <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>). This real estate listing is advantageously easily maintained by the RE facilitator inasmuch as buildings rarely are built, are demolished, or have their ownership/management information changed, at least as compared to the frequency at which portions thereof become available or unavailable for lease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> From the listing of real estate, the would-be tenant selects one or more (or even all) of the reviewed real estate as possibly desirable real estate (step <highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight>). The would-be tenant may thereafter send a request for information (RFI) to each landlord associated with the selected real estate (step <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>). As compared to a PRS or RFP, an RFI includes significantly less information. For example, an RFI may primarily include the desired move-in date and the desired square footage (whereas an RFP includes significantly more, e.g., financial information). From this minimal information, the landlords that are interested in pursuing this real estate demand further respond in the affirmative to the RFI (step <highlight><bold>1425</bold></highlight>) with the requested information (e.g., amount of square footage available at a certain date or dates). The would-be tenant can then review the responses to the RFIs and select the real estate (and associated landlords) that still appear to be desirable (step <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>). These selected pieces of real estate may be considered in combination as an ad hoc potential real estate supply database. It should be noted that the communications corresponding to the steps of the flowchart <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> may be effectuated in whole or in part via an electronic transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A communication/negotiation exchange preferably uses communication screens, which may be accessed using, for example, a browser or other thin-client. The communication screens provide input areas for the user to enter text, including questions, responses, and comments. Notably, a previous piece of relevant information (including a question) is repeated for the convenience of the would-be respondent. The respondent can easily see the context and previous precipitant of the relevant information, as well as enter a response and/or comment in provided area(s) because the previous response(s)/question(s) appear along side, or otherwise in proximity to, the current issue(s)/question(s). In these (and other) manners, a history of the RFI and/or RFP exchanges and dialogues or other communications may be logged, recorded, and subsequently noted. Moreover, the use of &ldquo;ball in court&rdquo; tracking, as discussed above, facilitates prompt responses and convenient monitoring of communication exchanges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As an example, a communication/negotiation exchange could involve a Request for Information (RFI) dialogue between a potential tenant and a landlord. Once the potential tenant receives a response to the RFI, the potential tenant can then be given the option to comment on or request clarification or additional information relating to the response. Preferably, the potential tenant is presented with each original question in the RFI, the landlord&apos;s corresponding response, and a space or field in which to insert a comment or additional related question to be sent to the landlord. If the landlord elects to respond to the comments or additional questions, the landlord is likewise presented with the entire dialogue that has occurred with regard to each initial question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As alluded to hereinabove, the real estate listing that the would-be tenant reviews (at step <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>) may be from a database that is created and then maintained by a RE facilitator with relative ease. For example, while the RE facilitator preferably knows of the existence of every (e.g., commercially leasing) building in a given geographic region, the RE facilitator need not create, much less maintain an updated, database of specific square footage blocks available within the buildings. Not only is the amount of information of the database significantly reduced (e.g., by a factor of approximately 20), the information therein also changes significantly less frequently. It should be understood that the RFI alternative embodiment as described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is optional. However, it advantageously improves the workload management of the real estate participants of the on-line mechanism as well as increasing the &ldquo;realness&rdquo; of the deal, thus improving participation for any given deal. It is possible, for example, that real tours may be elected to be taken before RFPs are sent out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a user may customize many/all of the forms <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) available for use in the real estate transaction process. Customized form building can be used, for example, to generate RFIs and Request for Proposals (RFPs). An RFI or RFP can be generated from a list of required questions (e.g., available space in square feet, available move-in date, etc.), selected optional questions, and custom questions (i.e., user generated question based on specific space needs, such as general office space or technology space). Thus, an RFI or RFP that is entirely customized for the particular potential tenant, real estate transaction, and/or building can be conveniently generated and sent to one or more landlords that have been identified as having real estate that potentially meets the tenant&apos;s needs. Such customized RFIs and RFPs can also be saved for reuse. For example, a company might generate customized RFIs and RFPs by region (e.g., Southwest) or group (e.g., sales group) that can be saved and used as a customized template for future real estate transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form of an alternative embodiment for linking tenants to real estate in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. The flowchart <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>B (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>) addresses landlord review of entries in a real estate demand database (at step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>), landlord identification and indication of interest of one or more entries (at step <highlight><bold>755</bold></highlight>), and landlord instigation of a presentation of interest to the would-be tenant (at step <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>). (See also the searching/viewing arrow <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and related text.) The flowchart <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> illustrates an alternative for how and when a landlord indicates such interest. Initially, an entity qualifies as a landlord (step <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>) with the on-line mechanism. The entity may qualify as a landlord by providing information regarding real estate holdings possessed by the entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> This real estate information is especially valuable if it pertains to currently available real estate. Regardless, the information may be a valuable addition to any real estate listing maintained by the RE facilitator for eventual review and consideration by a would-be tenant. Instead of needing to spend time and money to collect information on every piece of real estate in a given geographic area, landlords themselves are prompted and encouraged (as well as required at least to gain initial entry) to provide information on their possessed real estate holdings. To gain access to the real estate demand (aggregation) database, landlords may therefore be required to contribute to the real estate supply database. This contribution requirement also serves to provide a measure of security and privacy for the real estate demand (aggregation) database by instituting an authorization access privilege therefor, with the authorization access privilege being established such that it may be met by owners/managers of real estate. After the entity is qualified as a landlord (at step <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>), the landlord may review the real estate demand (aggregation) database (step <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The landlord may review the real estate demand database entry-by-entry or after narrowing the total number of entries by, e.g., limiting the entries (e.g., via a search or organized category selection) according to square footage, geography, move-in date, etc. The landlord may review entries (e.g., a PRS, RFIs, RFI responses, etc.) corresponding to projects that are still beginning or even projects for which RFIs have been sent out. (Landlords may optionally be given the opportunity to review project/deals that are further along.) It should be noted that the would-be tenants (or other project participants) may elect to have their privacy maintained by having their name/identification withheld and/or hidden from review by landlords or other third parties that have been granted authorization to review entries. When the landlord detects an entry of interest (step <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>), the landlord can select to request entry into the deal/project (step <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>). For example, the landlord (in a web-based embodiment) may be able to click on a web page &ldquo;button&rdquo; that reads &ldquo;Get Me in This Deal&rdquo;, or similar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The landlords request to have an opportunity to enter the deal (at step <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>) is honored by offering the tenant the option to permit this &ldquo;new&rdquo;, or additional, landlord to enter the deal (step <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight>). This offer may take the form of, for example, the sending to the would-be tenant (who may still be unidentified) of an unsolicited response to the initial RFI through the on-line mechanism of the RE facilitator. The would-be tenant may optionally be given the opportunity to prevent such opt-in requests from additional landlords or even the opportunity to prevent its project/deal from being presented to landlords reviewing the real estate demand database. After receiving the unsolicited RFI &ldquo;response&rdquo; (at step <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight>), the would-be tenant may respond to the offer by either excluding the &ldquo;new&rdquo; landlord or including the &ldquo;new&rdquo; landlord. If the would-be tenant elects to include the RFI &ldquo;response&rdquo;, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; landlord may be entered into an ad hoc potential real estate supply database and/or may proceed to prepare a proposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Landlords are thus offered access to the real estate demand (aggregation) database to peruse specifications, deal status, etc. Landlords can consequently &ldquo;throw their hat into the ring&rdquo; by submitting information covering real estate that they have to offer to the would-be tenant. This aspect of the present invention beneficially further exposes relevant information to real estate market participants, which therefore more closely emulates a market in which perfect information is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In addition, instead of having to perform manual searches, an automated agent for a landlord may be established to search for potential tenant(s) in the real estate demand database of the system. For example, a &ldquo;Current Demand Agent&rdquo; may be established to regularly search for real estate needs of a predetermined size(s) at a predetermined date(s) in a give market. In other words, a landlord can cause the demand database to be searched at regular intervals with or without reports being generated for each search (e.g, only if a successful match found, regardless, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The demand aggregation functionality described hereinabove with reference to, for example, the real estate demand database <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 8</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>), and step <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>), is described primarily, but not exclusively, in terms of current demand or &ldquo;near-term&rdquo; future demand. However, applying &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; future demand to the (other) principles of the present invention is also advantageous. For example, a current tenant may cause to be posted (e.g., by adding to the real estate demand (aggregation) database) particulars of a current lease. The posting may stipulate that the current tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; has a lease of &ldquo;X&rdquo; square feet in region/area &ldquo;Y&rdquo; expiring at date &ldquo;Z&rdquo;. Landlords are therefore empowered to search/view &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; demand by perusing these currently-in-effect contracts. Again, the landlord access may be straightforward, may be based on key term searches, may be based on selection of an organization category, may be in conjunction with current and &ldquo;near-term&rdquo; accessing, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The current tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; may therefore enjoy (e.g., welcome and/or invite) unsolicited bids for meeting the tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo;&apos;s real estate, e.g., leasing needs upon expiration of its current contract. Thus, current tenants can post the particulars of their current real estate situation, including details of their current lease, if desired. The term &ldquo;current real estate situation&rdquo; in this context may embrace the inclusion and/or consideration of &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; future demand entry or entries, at least by inference. The tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; may optionally elect to remain anonymous and to merely post non-identifying details of its current real estate situation. The tenant &ldquo;WI&rdquo; may also be given the opportunity (e.g., by the RE facilitator) to stipulate who is permitted to access its current real estate situation. This stipulation may take the form of, for example, the barring of particular individual landlords, the barring of particular categories of landlords, event-by-event election as to whether the identity of the tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; is to be revealed to a given interested landlord (e.g., by e-mail inquiry to the tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; whenever a landlord indicates interest in an anonymous current real estate situation entry), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the RE facilitator may determine which landlords are given access based on, e.g., a tiered or privileged delineation, with various levels assigned based on financial remuneration from a landlord, the extent to which the landlord uses (e.g., completes a real estate transaction over) the on-line mechanism, the frequency with which the landlord updates its associated entries in the real estate supply database, etc. It should be noted that landlords may submit for inclusion in a real estate supply database, for posting, etc. the real estate agreements to which they are a party. Ultimately, the on-line mechanism may produce for viewing/searching access a &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; real estate demand from tenants as well as a &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; real estate supply from landlords. Such real estate supply and demand information may be consequently exposed and laid open to the myriad of participants in the real estate marketplace. If a tenant &ldquo;W&rdquo; elects to submit (e.g., for posting) most or all of its current leases (e.g., the entirety of its real estate situation), then the on-line mechanism can serve as a window to the real estate portfolio of the given tenant </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an exemplary method in flowchart form for lease administration in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>. Many tenants (and landlords) have such an extensive real estate portfolio that it becomes difficult to manage and plan for renewing or otherwise handling the expiration of each lease. The on-line mechanism of certain embodiment (s) of the present invention can be advantageously employed to help with lease administration. Optionally but preferably, software that is part of, or that is merely operationally interactive with, software running all or parts of an on-line mechanism in accordance with the present invention is adapted to interface with the lease administration software of a client (e.g., a tenant or landlord). The software of the on-line mechanism can therefore interface with the external system of the client (step <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight>). Using the optional interface, or another form of input such as a manual entry, the leases of the client are loaded into a database (step <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The database may be, for example, a separate database that only stores leases for lease administration and perhaps for only an individual client/individual client situation. Alternatively, the database may be part of a larger real estate demand (aggregation) database, with each entry tagged as also being part of a lease administration sub-database. Regardless, the leases that have been loaded into the database are monitored for upcoming expiration (step <highlight><bold>1615</bold></highlight>), e.g., by extracting the lease expiration date and other pertinent information such as the number of square feet leased, monthly lease amount, etc. While the leases are being monitored, they may be optionally entered as &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; demand entries. Alternatively, a real estate demand entry may only be entered as a given current lease nears expiration. Once a given lease has been detected as expiring in the near-term or immediate future, a lease handling routine is triggered (step <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The lease handling routine may entail, for example, attempting to renegotiate the current lease (for either a tenant client or a landlord client), entering relevant information from the lease into a real estate demand (aggregation) database (for a tenant client), having the tenant client produce a new PRS, entering relevant information from the lease into a real estate supply database (for a landlord client), having the landlord client produce/enter new information for a new real estate supply database entry, etc. It should be noted that &ldquo;near-term&rdquo; may correspond to, for example, a period of one year or less. However, this period is illustrative only because &ldquo;near-term&rdquo;&excl; may depend on the complexity involved for the tenant client to be able to move to a new location (with accompanying outfitting, etc.), if desired. Also, in this context, entering an entry into a database may correspond merely to activating the entry as being available for searching/viewing access (including comparison access). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> After the lease handling routine (of step <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>) is completed and a new lease is executed, the new lease is entered into the database (step <highlight><bold>1625</bold></highlight>). The monitoring may be continued (step <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>) until another upcoming lease expiration is detected (at step <highlight><bold>1615</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that the new lease may also be forwarded to the lease administration software of the client using an established interface. It should be emphasized that while lease administration is beneficial for tenant clients (who may have hundreds or more leases for monitoring), it is also beneficial for landlord clients, who may have thousands of leases in a single building alone. These leases may also be beneficially tracked/monitored with the landlord being informed when a lease is due to be terminated. Lease administration embodiment (s) may therefore provide a seamless integration of leases currently in effect (e.g., via a client&apos;s lease administration system and/or software) with acquisition of a new lease via an on-line real estate mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In other embodiment(s) in accordance with the present invention, information regarding a current project/deal may be provided to entities (e.g., entities <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>) in exchange for value. The entities may include vendors who profit from real estate moves/transactions and are relevant to one or more of the phases <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), such as IT installers, movers, etc. The information (e.g., access to the deal flow as tracked by the on-line mechanism, with or without on-line collaboration) may be exchanged for referrals, financial remuneration, or other value. The entities may also be given the opportunity/authorization to send an electronic transmission to a would-be tenant of a project/deal bidding on or offering to bid on the provision of goods or service in the project/deal. The would-be tenant may accept or refuse such bids or offers to bid, and the would-be tenant may also be given the option of preventing access to its project/deal by such third party suppliers. These embodiment(s) may entail selling information during a project/deal/transaction to vendors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> However, in other embodiment(s) in accordance with the present invention, information regarding past projects/deals/transactions may be provided to entities. Information regarding past projects/deals/transactions may be (e.g., statistically) tracked and trended, and this &ldquo;research&rdquo; information may be exchanged for value. After extracting and combining information from multiple projects/deals/transactions that have been effectuated through the on-line mechanism, the summary transaction data may be sold or otherwise exchanged for value with interested parties, such as developers, lenders, appraisers, etc. Updated summary transaction data information may be provided, for example, via an electronic transmission and, optionally, at regular intervals. The trended data may include, for example: (1) average lease rates per building; (2) average time length for deals to be completed; (3) average number of bidders per deal; (4) average number of participants of the on-line mechanism; (5) ranking of buildings&apos;, lease rates, parking options, tenant improvement allowances, etc.; etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiment(s) in accordance with the present invention, real estate agreements may be provided via an on-line mechanism. These real estate agreements may include real estate lease contracts, for example, and they may be stored at the RE facilitator <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) (e.g., under the forms <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>). Parties to real estate agreements, which may cover any contract between parties in any of the various phases <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> (of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), may separately or jointly create or build a contract on-line by electing to select or delete standard clauses, sections, and/or addendums that are provided by the RE facilitator. This contract creation/building may be effectuated in real-time or non-real-time in an on-line collaborative environment. The trending aspects of certain embodiment(s) of the present invention as described hereinabove may be advantageously used to track which clauses, section, and/or addendums are selected most frequently, are selected by particular industries, are selected for particular types of real estate, etc. The statistical information derived from this tracking may be applied to gradually develop &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; agreements and/or to gradually further refine the standard agreements previously provided by the on-line mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments of the present invention thus place the tenant customer in the center of the real estate transaction and enable a demand-focused scheme and an on-line mechanism that further permits a parallel approach to the real estate acquisition and outfitting process. The demand aggregation and ad hoc real estate supply database aspects of certain embodiment(s) of the present invention therefore facilitate the empowerment of the tenant customer by the real estate industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiment(s) of the methods, systems, and arrangements of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment(s) disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth and defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
