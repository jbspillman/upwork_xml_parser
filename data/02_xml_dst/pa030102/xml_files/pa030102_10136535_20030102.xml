<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a shoe for use in a swash plate type compressor and a swash plate type compressor with the pair of shoes interposed between a swash plate and a piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A swash plate type compressor compresses gas by converting rotation of a swash plate to reciprocation of a piston. A pair of shoes, or sliding members, is interposed between the swash plate, which rotates at a high speed, and the piston, which reciprocates at a high speed, to ensure smooth operations of the swash plate and the piston. Since the swash plate rotates at a high speed, sliding performance between the swash plate and the piston is required to be relatively high. The shoe is generally hemispherical crown-shaped. Namely, the shoe includes a substantially plane sliding surface sliding with respect to the swash plate, and a substantially hemispherical sliding surface sliding with respect to the piston. In the hemispherical crown shoe, it is desired that sliding performance between the plane sliding surface and a sliding surface of the swash plate is relatively high. Lubricant oil is supplied between the sliding surfaces, and a layer of the lubricant oil is formed between the sliding surfaces. Thereby, relatively high sliding performance is maintained. Accordingly, when the lubricant oil supplied between the sliding surfaces is not sufficient, sliding performance therebetween deteriorates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A prior art for supplying sufficient lubricant oil between the sliding surface of the hemispherical crown shoe and the sliding surface of the swash plate is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.56-126686. In the prior art, a chamfered surface is provided in the vicinity of the plane sliding surface of the shoe with respect to the swash plate, and an angle between the chamfered surface and the extended plane sliding surface of the shoe with respect to the swash plate ranges from 0.5&deg; to 10&deg;. According to the prior art, sufficient lubricant oil is supplied between the sliding surfaces due to the chamfered surface provided at the outer periphery of the shoe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is another problem that causes sliding performance to deteriorate. For example, There are many foreign substances in a swash plate type compressor, such as refuse produced due to friction in various places, remaining microscopic burrs arisen upon manufacturing process of components, and dusts introduced from a refrigerant conduit connected to the compressor. These foreign substances should be sufficiently managed. However, completely removing these foreign substances is difficult. Therefore, these foreign substances can be involved in between the sliding surfaces, and then can remain. When the foreign substances remain between the sliding surfaces, the sliding surfaces are flawed, and sliding performance between the sliding surfaces deteriorates. When the angle between the chamfered surface and the extended plane sliding surface of the shoe with respect to the swash plate is as small as that in the prior art, not only lubricant oil but also foreign substances can be involved in between the sliding surfaces. Actually, sufficient sliding performance has not been obtained by such the hemispherical crown shoe yet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A pair of shoes constituting a swash plate type compressor for use in an air conditioner of a vehicle will be described, for example. The front side and the rear side correspond to the left side and the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes a cylinder block, and a plurality of cylinder bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is defined in the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on an identical circumference relative to the central axis of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cylinder bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extend in the direction of the central axis of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> The cylinder bores <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> each accommodates a single-headed piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to reciprocate. The front end surface of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connects with a front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the rear end surface of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connects with a rear housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the rear housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constitute a housing of the swash plate type compressor. A suction chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a discharge chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are defined between the rear housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and connect with an external refrigerant circuit, which is not shown, through an inlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, respectively. The valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forms a suction port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a suction valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a discharge port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a discharge valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is supported by the housing so as to rotate with respect to the central axis of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively support the front end and the rear end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through bearings. The cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms a support hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> along its central axis, and the rear end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is supported by the support hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The front end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connects with an engine of a vehicle, or a driving source, which is not shown, through a clutch mechanism such as an electromagnetic clutch. Therefore, as the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connects with the engine by the clutch mechanism upon an operation of the engine, the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rotates around the axis thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such that the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> tilts and relatively moves in a direction along the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> forms a through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> along its central axis, and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends through the through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> gradually increases in diameter toward both opening ends of the through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and the cross sections of the opening ends are oblong holes. A lug plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is secured to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and is supported by the front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a thrust bearing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> integrally rotates with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and tilts with respect to the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The hinge mechanism <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is constituted of a pair of support arms <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> fixed to the lug plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a pair of guide pins <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> slidably fitted into a pair of guide holes <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the support arms <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, the through hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the outer circumferential surface of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an engaging portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The engaging portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> overpasses the periphery of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed with the engaging portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is fitted into the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment is a hollow head to be light in weight. The head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the valve plate assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cooperatively define a compression chamber. Also, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> engages with the periphery of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through a pair of shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which is substantially hemispherical. The shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is converted to reciprocation of the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> moves from a top dead center toward a bottom dead center, refrigerant gas in the suction chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is sucked into the compression chamber in the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the suction port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the suction valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> moves from the bottom dead center toward the top dead center, the refrigerant gas in the compression chamber in the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is compressed and discharged to the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the discharge port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the discharge valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Compression reactive force acts on the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a direction along the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in accordance with compressing the refrigerant gas. The front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives the compression reactive force through the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the lug plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the thrust bearing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms a supply passage <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so as to extend through the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The supply passage <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> interconnects the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a crank chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which is defined between the front housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A control valve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is interposed in the supply passage <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The value of an electric current supplied to a solenoid <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the control valve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is controlled by a controller mainly constituted of a computer, which is not shown, based on information such as cooling load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> forms a bleed passage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> inside. The bleed passage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> opens its one end to the support hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and opens its other end to the crank chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The support hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> interconnects with the suction chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through a bleed port <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Thereby, pressure differential between the pressure in the compression chamber in the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> applied to the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the pressure in the crank chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is adjusted, and strokes of the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are varied by varying the inclination angle of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thus adjusting the displacement of the compressor. Additionally, the crank chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> disconnects from the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by energizing the control valve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and the crank chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> interconnects with the discharge chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by de-energizing the control valve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>.

The outer circumferential surfaces of the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are coated with fluororesin. Since the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are coated with fluororesin, seizure is inhibited by avoiding directly contacting with a metal of the same kind, and clearances between the cylinder block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are drastically reduced. Besides, the material of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the pistons <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the coating layers are not limited as described above, but may be changed into other materials. </paragraph>

The engaging portions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> each provide a pair of arms <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a connecting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The pair of arms <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> extends in parallel with each other in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>.

The facing surfaces of the arms <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> form spherical concave surfaces <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for supporting the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and sliding with respect to the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, respectively. The spherical concave surfaces <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> cooperatively form a part of an identical hypothetical spherical sliding surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which slides with respect to the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, is made of ductile iron FCD700. Aluminum layers are formed on the sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the base member by metal spraying, and lubricant layers are further formed on the aluminum layers. The lubricant layers are made of synthetic resin dispersedly containing molybdenum disulfide and graphite as a solid lubricant. The aluminum layers sufficiently reduce friction generated between the sliding surfaces, and ensure relatively high sliding performance between the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Even if the lubricant layers abrade or peel off due to some causes, the aluminum layers inhibit the base member from directly sliding, and maintain a smooth slide. In the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the lubricant layers are respectively 15 &mgr;m, and the thickness of the aluminum layers are respectively 60 &mgr;m. Besides, The structure of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such as the material of the base member of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the material and thickness of the lubricant layer, with or without the lubricant layer, the thickness of the aluminum spraying layer, and with or without the aluminum spraying layer, may be varied. Since an iron series material is relatively low cost, a compressor with a swash plate made of iron series is also relatively low cost. In addition, when operating the compressor with constant displacement, the inclination angle of the swash plate is desired to be constant. Since the swash plate made of iron series is relatively large in weight, the inclination angle of the swash plate can be stable due to its inertial force. Since the shape of the swash plate made of iron series is complicated, the swash plate is preferably manufactured by molding. Therefore, the material of the swash plate is preferably cast iron, and is more preferably ductile cast iron having relatively high strength and high durability, and is much more preferably FCD700 having further high strength. Since the swash plate rotates at a high speed, the swash plate and the shoes slide under relatively hard conditions. Therefore, the lubricant layer is formed on the sliding surface of the swash plate for ensuring lubrication between the sliding surfaces. Thereby, friction generated between the sliding surfaces is reduced, and the compressor smoothly operates. For example, the lubricant layer may be formed by synthetic resin containing a solid lubricant. In such a state, the solid lubricant includes at least one of molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, graphite and polytetrafluoroethylene. Also, the synthetic resin includes at least one of polyamideimide, epoxy resin, polyether ketone and phenolic resin. For example, synthetic resin layer dispersedly containing the solid lubricant is formed on the surface of the swash plate by spraying, and after that the synthetic resin layer is solidified, thus forming the lubricant layer. Besides, the thickness of the lubricant layer preferably ranges from 3 &mgr;m to 30 &mgr;m. Also, the strength of the lubricant layer formed on the swash plate is less than that of the base member of the swash plate. When the lubricant layer is removed due to abrasion or peeling, the base member directly slides with respect to the shoe. Thereby, sliding performance of the swash plate deteriorates. When the base member of the swash plate abrades due to a direct slide, sliding performance of the swash plate further deteriorates. Therefore, even if the lubricant layers are removed off, the shoes including metal spraying layers between the base members and the lubricant layers sufficiently ensure high sliding performance due to high sliding performance of the metal spraying layers. Additionally, when the shoes made of iron series alloy slide with respect to the swash plate, the base member of which is made of iron series alloy, and when the lubricant layer of the swash plate is removed off, members made of materials of the same kind slide with respect to each other. Thereby, seizure may arise. Therefore, the metal spraying layer inhibits the seizure from arising. Also, an aluminum spraying layer is preferably employed as the metal spraying layer because of its relatively low cost. Also, the thickness of the metal spraying layer preferably ranges from 100 &mgr;m to 200 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

The plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, which is substantially a plane in shape, slides with respect to the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, which is substantially a part of sphere surface in shape, slides with respect to the piston <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> interconnects the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Strictly, the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> forms a convex surface, the radius of curvature of which is very large. Also, a recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is formed at the center of the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> so as to stay lubricant oil. Thereby, high sliding performance is ensured. Consequently, the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is annular in shape. Besides, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is generally called a hemispherical crown shoe. Practically, a spherical sliding surface and a plane sliding surface of the hemispherical crown shoe are modified from a strict spherical sliding surface and a strict plane sliding surface so as to improve sliding performance. Also, strictly, a shoe for use in a variable displacement compressor is smaller than a hemisphere, and a shoe for use in a fixed displacement compressor is larger than a hemisphere. In the variable displacement compressor, since both spherical sliding surfaces of the pair of shoes disposed on each side of the swash plate are required to cooperatively form a part of identical hypothetical spherical sliding surface, each of the shoes is substantially a part of sphere, and the thickness of each of the shoe is substantially a half of the thickness of the swash plate less than a hemisphere. On the other hand, in the fixed displacement compressor, since no such limitations as that of the variable displacement compressor is required, each of the shoes is substantially a part of sphere. However, the thickness of each of the shoes is more than a hemisphere to inhibit the area of the sliding surface of the shoe from reducing even if the plane sliding surface abrades. </paragraph>

The rounded surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> interconnects the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> without any definite border.

Besides, the spherical sliding surfaces <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the pair of shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> cooperatively form a part of identical hypothetical spherical sliding surface.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> includes a base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, which coats the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the thickness of the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is exaggerated for easier understanding. The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is made of Al-Si series alloy such as A4032, the base of which is aluminum with containing silicon such that the composition ratio is closer to that of eutectic. The metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is formed by electroless plating with nickel. The hardness and the strength of the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is relatively high. Thereby, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is inhibited from abrading and being flawed. The metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> includes an outer layer and an inner layer, which are not shown in figures. The outer layer forms the surface of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The inner layer is interposed between the outer layer and the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The outer layer is formed by electroless plating with nickel eutectic with phosphorus, boron and tungsten (Ni&mdash;P&mdash;B&mdash;W electroless plating). The inner layer is formed by electroless plating with nickel eutectic with phosphorus (Ni&mdash;P electroless plating). Additionally, the average thickness of the outer layer is 25 &mgr;m, and the average thickness of the inner layer is 25 &mgr;m. The total average thickness of the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is 50 &mgr;m. Besides, the material of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is not limited to that in the embodiment described above, but may be modified into various kinds of structures. The shoe, the base member of which is made of aluminum series alloy, is relatively light in weight. Therefore, the shoe is appropriate for use in a swash plate type compressor installed to an air conditioner of a vehicle. A kind of aluminum series alloy is not limited. Aluminum alloy, which is generally used, or which is well-known, may be applied. Concretely, for example, Al&mdash;Si having eutectic composition of approximately A4032, may be applied. Since Al&mdash;Si series alloy has relatively small coefficient of thermal expansion and relatively high abrasion resistance, the shoes slide smoothly. Also, for example, Al&mdash;Cu&mdash;Mg series alloy such as A2017 or A2024 may be applied. Since the strength of the Al&mdash;Cu&mdash;Mg series alloy is relatively high, the shoes perform relatively high strength and high durability. Since the strength and the hardness of the aluminum series alloy are relatively low, the aluminum series alloy is easily deformed, is flawed, and is relatively low in abrasion resistance. Since the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment include the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> on its surface. Thereby, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> perform relatively high abrasion resistance. Also, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are inhibited from being flawed due to the metal plating layer, and have relatively high sliding performance. Besides, the metal plating layer may be formed on part of surface of the shoes, and, for example, may be formed on the plane sliding surface only. Also, a kind of the metal plating layer is not limited. As far as the metal plating layer is harder than aluminum series alloy forming the base member of the shoes, the metal plating layer inhibits the shoes from being flawed. The hardness of the metal plating layer is preferably Hv300 (Vickers hardness) or above. The shoes including the metal plating layer perform relatively high abrasion resistance, and are inhibited from being flawed. Concretely, the metal plating layer may be formed by electroless plating with nickel, a series of electroless plating with cobalt eutectic with phosphorus, and hard chrome plating. Particularly, the metal plating layer formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating, or by electroless plating with nickel eutectic with boron (Ni&mdash;B electroless plating), is uniform, and the metal plating layers when solidified has the hardness of Hv500 or above. Thereby, the metal plating layers perform relatively high abrasion resistance and high anti-corrosion. Therefore, the metal plating layer is preferably formed by electroless plating with nickel. Also, the metal plating layer may be formed with a single layer, and may be formed with a plurality of layers. For example, the metal plating layer includes an outer layer forming the surface of the shoe and an inner layer between the outer layer and the base member. When the two layers are formed by electroless plating with nickel, preferably, the inner layer is formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating, and the outer layer is formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating containing relatively small phosphorus in ratio and also containing another chemical element. A series of Ni&mdash;P metal plating layer firmly adheres to aluminum series alloy, solidifies relatively in a short time, materials for a plating bath are relatively low cost, and hardly corrodes. Therefore, the shoe having Ni&mdash;P metal plating layer also performs such characteristics. Additionally, the metal plating layer formed by Ni&mdash;P&mdash;B&mdash;W electroless plating performs much relatively high abrasion resistance. Therefore, the outer layer is preferably formed by Ni&mdash;P&mdash;B&mdash;W electroless plating. Also, the metal plating layer formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating is much relatively low cost among a series of electroless plating with nickel, and firmly adheres to the base member. Therefore, the inner layer is preferably formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating. Besides, when the metal plating layer includes the inner layer formed by a series of Ni&mdash;P electroless plating and the outer layer formed by a series of Ni&mdash;B electroless plating, the thickness of the inner layer preferably ranges from 1 &mgr;m to 25 &mgr;m, the thickness of the outer layer preferably ranges from 19 &mgr;m to 75 &mgr;m, and the total thickness of the metal plating layer preferably ranges from 20 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. Also, iron series alloy is relatively low cost and relatively high in strength and hardness. Therefore, the shoe, the base member of which is made of iron series alloy, is relatively low cost, and performs relatively high abrasion resistance and high durability. A kind of iron series alloy is not limited. Carbon chrome bearing steel SUJ2 is preferably employed. The shoe made of SUJ2 is manufactured by heat treatment such as quenching or tempering. </paragraph>

Strictly, the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is convex in shape as mentioned above. Therefore, a small clearance <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is maintained between the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> adjacent to the outer periphery and the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>.

On the other hand, when the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is relatively large, lubricant oil is more efficiently involved in between the sliding surfaces, as compared with the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which is relatively small. When the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is extremely small, and when the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> contacts with the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may peel off the lubricant layer containing a solid lubricant because of the relatively low strength and hardness of the lubricant layer. Also, when the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is extremely small, the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> excludes not only the foreign substances <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> but also lubricant oil. Furthermore, the surfaces of the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are usually smoothed by barrel polishing, and the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may abut against each other upon barrel polishing. Therefore, when the radius of curvature the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is extremely small, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be flawed due to the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is determined based on the purpose of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in view of characteristics for excluding foreign substances <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and characteristics for involving lubricant oil. To smoothly involve the lubricant oil in between the sliding surfaces, to inhibit the shoe from being flawed upon barrel polishing, and to avoid the metal plating layer from abrading, the radius of curvature of the rounded corner is preferably 0.05 mm or above, and is more preferably 0.1 mm or above, and is much more preferably 0.15 mm or above. When the radius of curvature of the rounded corner is relatively large, relatively small foreign substances abut not against the chamfered surface but against the rounded corner. In such a state, characteristics for excluding foreign substances depends on an angle between a tangent plane at a point of contact with a foreign substance and the extended plane sliding surface, that is, a tangent plane angle. When the shoe abuts against foreign substances at its chamfered surface, as the tangent plane angle increases, characteristics for excluding foreign substances improves. In addition, when a foreign substance of the same diameter abuts against the rounded corner, as the radius of curvature of the rounded corner increases, the tangent plane angle reduces. Namely, as the radius of curvature of the rounded corner reduces, characteristics for excluding foreign substances improves. When the shoe abuts against foreign substances at its chamfered surface, the chamfered surface angle exceeding 20&deg; sufficiently excludes foreign substances. Likewise, when the shoe abuts against foreign substances at its rounded corner, the tangent plane angle exceeding 20&deg; sufficiently excludes foreign substances. For example, when foreign substances are assumed to be sphere in shape, and when the rounded corner having the radius of curvature of 0.5 mm abuts against a foreign substance having the diameter of approximately 30 &mgr;m, the tangent plane angle is approximately 20&deg;. Also, when the rounded corner having the radius of curvature of 0.3 mm abuts against a foreign substance having the diameter of approximately 20 &mgr;m, the tangent plane angle is approximately 20&deg;. Accordingly, when focusing on characteristics for excluding foreign substances, the radius of curvature of the rounded corner is 0.5 mm or below, preferably is 0.4 mm or below, and is more preferably 0.3 mm or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A conventional shoe (not shown in the drawings) will be described for comparing the conventional shoe with the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment. A chamfered surface angle of the conventional shoe is a few degrees. Therefore, the conventional shoe hardly excludes foreign substances involved in between the sliding surfaces, and the chamfered surface climbs on the foreign substances. Thereby, the foreign substances are strongly caught in between the sliding surfaces in accordance with the movement of the conventional shoe. Namely, the foreign substances are easily involved in a space between the sliding surfaces due to the wedge-shaped cross section of the space. Accordingly, the conventional shoe not only easily involves the foreign substances in between the sliding surfaces, but also causes a plane sliding surface with respect to the swash plate to be severely flawed. Also, the conventional shoe may peel off the lubricant layer formed on the sliding surface of the swash plate, and may cause the sliding surface of the swash plate to be flawed. Consequently, the sliding performance of the conventional shoe is not sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the above-described shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment, the chamfered surface angle &agr; is 45&deg;, and the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is 0.2 mm. According to the present invention, the chamfered surface angle &agr; and the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are determined based on the purpose of the shoe. When the chamfered surface angle &agr; is a relatively small appropriate angle, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> sufficiently involves lubricant oil in between the sliding surfaces. However, as the chamfered surface angle &agr; reduces, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> excludes foreign substance between the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the sliding surface of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> less efficiently. Namely, the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> easily climbs on the foreign substances. When the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> moves in such a state, the foreign substances are consequently involved in between the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the sliding surface of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. On the contrary, as the chamfered surface angle &agr; increases, the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is operative to exclude the foreign substances. Namely, as the chamfered surface angle &agr; increases, the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> excludes foreign substance more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When foreign substances are involved in between the sliding surfaces, the foreign substances cause not only friction of the sliding surfaces to increase but also each of the sliding surfaces to be flawed. The flaws on each of the sliding surfaces further flaw each of the facing sliding surfaces, and cause sliding performance to deteriorate. When the chamfered surface angle &agr; is relatively small, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> climbs on the foreign substances. Therefore, the foreign substances are forced in between the sliding surfaces, and flaws arisen between the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the sliding surface of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is deepened. Since flaws arise easily, durability against foreign substances reduces. Consequently, sliding performance of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> having a small chamfered surface angle &agr; is relatively low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when the chamfered surface angle &agr; is too large, that is, the chamfered surface angle &agr; is closer to 90&deg;, a problem on manufacturing a shoe rises. A hemispherical crown shoe is generally manufactured by flop forging. For example, a pair of dies for forging the shoe is constituted of a die for mainly molding the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and a die for mainly molding the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. A raw material in a predetermined shape plastically flows by forging the raw material in a cavity defined between the pair of dies. When forging by utilizing such the pair of dies, the accuracy of the height of the hemispherical crown shoe is especially important, that is, the accuracy of a distance between the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is important. Therefore, the cavity is preferably defined so as to permit quantity differentials among the raw materials at a side portion of the cavity. However, when the chamfered surface angle &agr; is too large, it is difficult to define a cavity for sufficiently permitting quantity differentials among the raw materials at a side portion of the cavity. Thereby, the shoe having high accuracy is hardly forged. Therefore, a relatively small chamfered surface angle &agr; of the shoe efficiently permits quantity differentials among the raw materials. When a shoe is inaccurately molded by forging, it takes many hours to adjust the accuracy by polishing after forging. Thereby, manufacturing cost of the shoe increases. Therefore, a relatively small chamfered surface &agr; is desirable when a hemispherical crown shoe is manufactured with low cost with high accuracy. Besides, when the height of the shoe is inaccurate and a distance between the shoe and the piston is relatively large, foreign substances are easily involved in between the sliding surfaces, or when a distance between the shoe and the piston is relatively small, friction generated between the sliding surfaces is excessive. In either case, sliding performance deteriorates. Also, when the chamfered surface angle is 30&deg; or above, characteristics for excluding foreign substance further improves. Additionally, when the chamfered surface angle is 40&deg; or above, characteristics for excluding foreign substance much further improves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> One of the manufacturing processes of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment will be described. The shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is manufactured by the steps of: a partially molding process, a forging process, a heat treatment process, a grinding and polishing process, a plating process, and a finishing process. The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is formed by the steps of a semi-molding process, a forging process, a heat treatment process, and a grinding and polishing process. The metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is formed by the step of a plating process. The raw material of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will be described first, and each of the manufacturing processes will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The raw material of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical aluminum series alloy having a smaller diameter and a greater height than the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The raw material is made by the steps of molding a billet, which is made of aluminum alloy with predetermined composition, forming a cylindrical rod with a predetermined diameter by extruding and drawing the billet, annealing the cylindrical rod, cutting the cylindrical rod into pieces with predetermined length by a sawing machine, and smoothing a surface of the cut raw material by barrel polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A part of the raw material is molded upon the partially molding process. Particularly, the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> at the center of the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is formed. The partially molding process is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A pressing apparatus with a pair of dies <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is used for partially molding the raw material. The pair of dies <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> includes a drag <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and a punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The drag <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> forms a hole <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> with a bottom at one end, the hole <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> having approximately the same inner diameter as the outer diameter of the raw material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is operative to extend into the hole <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The partially molding is performed by the steps of putting the raw material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in the hole <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, forcing the end of the punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> onto the raw material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, pushing the end of the punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> into the raw material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> by moving the punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> downward until the punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> reaches a predetermined position, A hole bored by the end of the punch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> forms the shape of the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The partially molded raw material is forged upon the forging process. The forging process is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A forging apparatus with a pair of dies <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> including a cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and a drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is used for cold-forging the partially molded raw material. The pair of dies <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> defines a cavity, which has substantially the same shape as the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, by fitting the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> onto the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> has a protrusion <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, the shape of which is substantially the same shape as the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The partially molded raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is positioned on the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> by fitting the protrusion <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> into the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In this manner, since the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is previously formed before a forging process, the partially molded raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is positioned appropriately in the pair of dies <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> by means of the recess <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the protrusion <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the partially molded raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> plastically flows isotropically. The forged base members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> maintain substantially the same shape and approximately the same dimensions, and ensure high quality. After putting the partially molded raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> on the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is forged by operating the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> downward and fitting the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> onto the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> More particularly, a plane portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of a molding surface of the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> molds a part of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> corresponding to the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and an inclined portion <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of the molding surface of the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> molds a part of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> corresponding to the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an angle between the plane portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the inclined portion <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> determines the foregoing chamfered surface angle &agr;. A rounded corner <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> provided between the plane portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the inclined portion <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> determines the radius of curvature of the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a molding surface <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> molds a part of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> corresponding to the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The height of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is determined by a clearance between the plane portion <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and the molding surface <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> upon fitting the cope <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> onto the drag <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The height of the hemispherical crown shoe is required to be accurate, nevertheless. Quantity of the raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> does not affect the height of the forged base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The volume of the cavity in the pair of dies <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is determined so as to exceed the volume of the partially molded raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the plastically flowed raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> does not fill the cavity, but flows toward the outer periphery of the cavity. Then, a space <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is left between the plastically flowed raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and the pair of dies <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. In other words, the rounded surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of the side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is molded substantially by open die forging, and the shape of the rounded surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> reflects the quantity of the raw material <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. The plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are accurately molded. In the present embodiment, since the chamfered surface angle &agr; of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is 45&deg;, the volume of the space <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> become relatively large. Therefore, even if the quantity of each of the raw materials is different, the raw materials can accurately be forged. Accordingly, cost for adjusting the dimensions of the raw material reduces. As a result, manufacturing cost of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> reduces. For example, as the chamfered surface angle &agr; increases, the volume of the space <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> reduces. In such a state, a permissible range of the dimensions of the raw materials reduces. Therefore, the chamfered surface angle &agr; may be preferably 60&deg; or below, and more preferably be 50&deg; or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the present manufacturing process, the forging process is constituted by only one process. However, a multi-process, which includes a plurality of sub-forging processes, may constitute the forging process. In such a state, the sub-molded raw material may be treated by annealing at one of intervals between the sub-forging processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> molded upon the forging process is treated by thermal refining upon the heat treatment process. In the present embodiment, thermal refining treated to the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> treatment, in which the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is treated by solution heat treatment, and then treated by artificial age hardening. In the solution heat treatment, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is kept in a heating furnace with a temperature of approximately 490&deg; C. for approximately an hour, and after that the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is rapidly cooled to a room temperature. In the artificial age hardening, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is kept in the heating furnace with a temperature of approximately 180&deg; C. for approximately five hours. T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> treatment in place of T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> treatment may be applied. In T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> treatment, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be treated by solution heat treatment, is and then treated by stabilizing treatment. In such a state, after treated by the solution heat treatment in the above-mentioned condition, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be kept in a heating furnace with a temperature of approximately 200&deg; C. for approximately five hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> treated by thermal refining is ground and polished for adjusting its dimensions and smoothing its surface upon the grinding process. The grinding and polishing process is constituted of a surface grinding process and a barrel polishing process. The surface of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> corresponding to the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is ground upon the surface grinding process. Several pieces of the base members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are aligned, and then ground by a surface grinding apparatus by means of free abrasive grains. The entire surface of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is polished upon the barrel polishing process. The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> together with free abrasive grains is put in a barrel polishing apparatus, and then is started. The surface grinding is mainly intended to adjust the height of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the barrel polishing is mainly intended to smooth the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The surface grinding process or the barrel polishing process, whichever can be performed first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The surface of the polished base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is coated with a metal plating layer upon the plating process. The metal plating layer is formed by electroless plating with nickel. An inner layer is formed by Ni&mdash;P electroless plating, and then an outer layer is formed by Ni&mdash;P&mdash;B&mdash;W electroless plating. The inner and the outer layers are formed by a conventional procedure, that is, the base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is pretreated and then immersed in a plating bath in accordance with the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the surface of which is coated with the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, or the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, is polished upon the finishing process. The shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is ground by barrel polishing upon the finishing process. When necessary, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is treated by surface grinding. After that, the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is polished by buffing. The barrel polishing and the surface grinding are performed in such a manner as described above upon the grinding and polishing process. Since the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> abut against each other upon barrel polishing, when corners or substantially corners are formed on the surfaces of the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be flawed due to the corners. Also, the metal plating layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> formed on the corners may abrade, and the base members <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> could expose themselves outside. However, In the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment, since a portion between the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is the rounded corner <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the radius of curvature of which is 0.2 mm, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are inhibited from being flawed, and the metal plating layers <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are also inhibited from abrading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The hemispherical crown shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is completed through the above-described processes. Manufacturing processes are not limited to the above-described processes. The shoe may be manufactured by various kinds of processes in accordance with specifications of target shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the following advantageous effects are obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Since the strength of the lubricant layer is relatively low, the lubricant layer may be easily peeled off due to foreign substances involved in between the shoes and the swash plate, and due to flaws of the shoes, however. In the present embodiment, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> efficiently exclude the foreign substances. Thereby, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are inhibited from being flawed. Accordingly, the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> rarely flaw the lubricant layer of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and relatively high sliding performance lasts relatively for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, but may be modified into the following examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, the present invention may be applied to a swash plate type compressor with a double-headed piston, having two heads on both sides of the engaging portion relative to the swash plate, or may be applied to a fixed displacement compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment, the side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the rounded surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> connecting with the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment may be modified into structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. The side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> includes only a chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Namely, the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> connects with both the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> includes a chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Namely, one end of the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> connects with the outer periphery of the plane sliding surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the chamfered surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> connects with one end of the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. In addition, the other end of the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> connects with the outer periphery of the spherical sliding surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Thus, the shape of the side surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be modified diversely. Besides, the shape of the surface other than the chamfered surface is not limited. Only when the side surface of the shoe has the chamfered surface adjacent to the plane sliding surface, the shoe may be applied. For example, the shoe having the chamfered surface connecting with the spherical sliding surface, that is, the entire of side surface is the chamfered surface, may be applied. Also, for example, the side surface other than the chamfered surface may form a cylindrical surface or a truncated cone-shaped surface, and an angle between the side surface other than the chamfered surface and the extended plane sliding surface may be optional, and then the side surface other than the chamfered surface may interconnect the chamfered surface and the spherical sliding surface. Also, the side surface other than the chamfered surface may include a plurality of rounded surfaces, and each of the rounded surfaces has the different radius of curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> An experiment is performed on the chamfered surface angle, the radius of curvature of the rounded corner and flaws of the shoes. Based on the above-described spherical shoe, several shoes were manufactured in such a manner that each of the chamfered surface angles was different from one another. Additionally, a shoe having a conventional shape is also manufactured. Each of the shoes was checked how the plane sliding surface worked relative to cast iron particles. The test comparatively checks characteristics for excluding cast iron particles and durability against cast iron particles. Manufactured shoes, conditions of the durability test against cast iron particles, and results of the durability test will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Five kinds of shoes in different shapes were manufactured.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Upon the durability test, the above-described shoes &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> were actually slid with respect to a swash plate. The durability test was performed in a manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. An apparatus <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for the durability test includes a rotatable swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a shoe holder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, by which the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are positioned on a sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to slide with respect to the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>.

The shoe holder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> also pushes the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> onto the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with predetermined force. The swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is the same as that in a practical use. The material of the base member, the thickness of the aluminum spraying layer formed on the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a kind and the thickness of a lubricant layer are the same as those described-above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> was rotated once on condition that the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> was lubricated by lubricant oil <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> &mgr;l amount, each of the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was held by the shoe holder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and was forced onto the swash plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with force <highlight><bold>784</bold></highlight>N, and cast iron particles 10 mg in weight were scattered on all over the sliding surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The cast iron particles are classified into two types by diameters of the particles. One type is the particles having the diameter of 38 &mgr;m to 75 &mgr;m, and the other type is the particles having the diameter of 75 &mgr;m to 120 &mgr;m. Each of the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was tested with each type of the particles. Each of the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was checked after the swash plate was rotated, and was scored by the number of flaws on the plane sliding surface of the shoes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and by the depth of the deepest flaw. Additionally, the number of the flaws was visually checked, and the depth of the flaw was checked by roughnessmeter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in TABLE <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the shoe &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the chamfered surface angle &agr; of which is relatively small 10&deg;, has the greatest number of flaws and the deepest depth of flaw, irrespective of the diameter of the particles. Meanwhile, the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the chamfered surface angles &agr; of which are relatively large, have the fewer number of flaws and the shallower depth of flaws than those of the shoe &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Particularly, particles having relatively large diameter cause the sliding surfaces of the shoe and the swash plate to be flawed, and deteriorate sliding performance between the sliding surfaces. Therefore, particles having relatively large diameter are simulated by scattering particles of diameter 75 &mgr;m to 120 &mgr;. The test result indicates that differentials of the number of flaws and the depth of the deepest flaw between the shoe &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are relatively large. Accordingly, the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having relatively large chamfered surface angle &agr; efficiently exclude the cast iron particles, and ensure relatively high durability against the cast iron particles. Thereby, it was demonstrated that the shoe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment ensures relatively high sliding performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Besides, the shoe &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having no chamfered surface but edged corner is manufactured for being compared with the other shoes &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The shoe &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as well as the shoes &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to &num;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> efficiently excludes the cast iron particles and ensures relatively high durability against the cast iron particles. However, there is difficulty in accurately manufacturing a shoe with low cost. Additionally, the edged corner may cause the sliding surface of the swash plate to be flawed. Therefore, the shoe &num;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
