<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor memory devices, and more particularly, to semiconductor memory devices including sense amplifiers and related methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor memory devices have been developed to provide increased storage capacities, operate at higher speeds, and consume less power. In particular, dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) may include shared bitline sense amplifiers, which are shared by two adjacent memory cell array blocks, and may use a memory cell array power voltage as a shared bitline sense amplifier power voltage. A memory cell array power voltage may be generated by internally reducing an external power voltage applied from outside the memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a conventional DRAM, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a waveform diagram illustrating the operation of sense amplifiers in the conventional DRAM of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, bitline sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are shared by two adjacent memory cell array blocks A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bi through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bi connected to the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are equalized to a voltage level AVb<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by equalization circuits AE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AE<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>j/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bj through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>j/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bj connected to the second memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are equalized to the voltage level AVbl by equalization circuits AE<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through AE<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> first isolation control signal APISOi and a second isolation control signal APISOj reach an external power voltage level AVdd. If the first isolation control signal APISOi reaches a boosting voltage AVpp level and the second isolation control signal APISOj drops to a ground voltage level AVss, pairs of first isolation transistors AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AT<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are turned on and pairs of second isolation transistors AT<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through AT<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are turned off. In other words, the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is selected, and the second memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Next, a wordline AWL of a memory cell in the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reaches the boosting voltage level AVpp. If a sense amplifier control signal ALAPG becomes logic &lsquo;low&rsquo; and an inverted signal ALANG of the sense amplifier control signal ALAPG becomes logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;, the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> start to operate. In other words, a first switch ASW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on, and then a memory cell array power voltage AVarray is supplied to a power voltage node ALA of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Then, a second switch ASW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, and ground voltage AVSS is supplied to a ground voltage node ALAB of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Then, the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> sense and amplify the data of the pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bi through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bi connected to the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In such a method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pairs of first isolation transistors AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AT<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are previously turned on at an early stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the first isolation control signal APISOi almost reaching the boosting voltage level AVpp, and thus the load of the pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bi through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bi connected to the selected memory cell array block (the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) increases. Accordingly, the operational characteristics of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may deteriorate and the amplification speed of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is another waveform diagram illustrating the operation of sense amplifiers of the conventional DRAM shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may address problems with the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the first and second isolation control signals APISOi and APISOj reach the external power voltage level AVdd at an early stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and then the first isolation control signal APISOi maintains the external power voltage level AVdd and the second isolation control signal APISOj drops to the ground voltage level AVss. The first isolation control signal APISOi reaches the boosting voltage level AVpp at a middle stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the pairs of first isolation transistors AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AT<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are weakly turned off by the first isolation control signal APISOi at the external power voltage level AVdd, and, thus, the load of the pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bi through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bi connected to the selected memory cell array block (the first memory cell array block A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) decreases. As a result, the amplification speed of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be increased using operations shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, because the pairs of first isolation transistors AT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AT<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may not completely turn off at an early stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers AS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through AS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the load of the pairs of bitlines ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bi through ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>i/ABL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bi may not be sufficiently blocked. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, a DRAM according to first embodiments of the present invention can further include pairs of first isolation transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, pairs of second isolation transistors T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, shared sense amplifiers S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a first switch SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a second switch SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The pairs of isolation transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be NMOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The first switch SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be a PMOS transistor and can transmit the memory cell array power voltage Varray to the power voltage node LA of the shared sense amplifiers S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in response to a sense amplifier control signal LAPG.

The shared sense amplifiers S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can then sense a difference in voltage between the pairs of second bitlines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>j/BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>Bj through BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>j/BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>Bj. </paragraph>

In other words, the transmission line along which the first isolation control signal PISOi is transmitted may float with respect to the isolation control circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in response to the pulse signal PS so that electric charges may not be compensated for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The isolation control circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may also float a transmission line, along which the second isolation control signal PISOj is transmitted, in response to the pulse signal PS at an early stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is, for a second period in the first period when the first control signal CNT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is activated. In other words, the transmission line along which the second isolation control signal PISOj is transmitted may float with respect to the isolation control circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in response to the pulse signal PS so that electric charges may not be compensated for. In this context, a transmission line may float with respect to the isolation control circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by providing a high impedance termination at the isolation control circuit.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in a precharge mode, the first and second equalization signals PEQi and PEQj are logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;, the sense amplifier control signal LAPG is logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;, and the inverted signal LANG of the sense amplifier control signal is logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the second equalization signal PEQj is maintained at a logic &lsquo;high&rsquo; level, the first equalization signal PEQi becomes logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;, the sense amplifier control signal LAPG becomes logic &lsquo;low, and the inverted signal LANG of the sense amplifier control signal LAPG becomes logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;, then the PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned on, and the NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned off.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If the second equalization signal PEQj is logic &lsquo;low&rsquo; and the first equalization signal PEQi is logic &lsquo;high, then the first control signal CNT<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes logic &lsquo;low&rsquo; and the second control signal CNT<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;.

In the second isolation control signal generator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are turned on, and thus the second isolation control signal PISOj drops to the ground voltage level Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, additional electrical charge is not provided from the first isolation control signal generator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the transmission line of the first isolation control signal PISOi during the period when the transmission line of the first isolation control signal PISOi is floating.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, if the control signal BLEQJ is maintained at a logic &lsquo;low&rsquo; level, the control signals BLSjDP and BLEQi are maintained at a logic &lsquo;high&rsquo; level, the control signal BLSiDP is logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;, and the pulse signal PS is logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;, then the PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on, and thus the first isolation control signal PlSOi reaches the boosting voltage level Vpp. The second isolation control signal PISOj is maintained at the ground voltage level Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the semiconductor memory device according to first embodiments of the present invention, the pairs of first isolation transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be completely turned off by reducing a voltage of the first isolation control signal PISOi to be significantly lower than the external power voltage level Vdd at an early stage of the operation of the sense amplifiers S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.
