<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An image display apparatus of a projection-type is provided which includes an illuminator with a light source, an optical modulator illuminated by light illuminator and which makes spatial modulation of the illumination light according to a to-be-displayed image for either transmission or reflection, and a projection lens to form an image of the optical modulator. The apparatus includes also a first reflecting element to reflect, towards the light source, the unwanted light of the light beam emitted from the illuminator and which will not illuminate the optical modulator, and a second reflecting element to guide, by reflecting, the unwanted light once reflected by the first reflecting element. In the apparatus, the combination of the light source and illuminator, which can recycle the unwanted light efficiently in the projector, makes it possible to inexpensively separate and recombine polarized components of the light beam. Use of a single-plate optical modulator formed from a color filter permits to utilize the light with an improved efficiency. Also by adopting a single-plate optical modulator of a sequential color-type, it is possible to attain an improved efficiency of light utilization. Thus, the efficiency of light utilization of an optical modulator whose numerical aperture is small can be improved and the peak brightness on a dark screen can be elevated. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an image display apparatus, and more particularly, to a projection-type image display apparatus including an optical modulator which is illuminated by light from an illuminator, and a projection lens which forms the modulated light from the optical modulator into an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A typical one of the conventional projection-type image display apparatuses includes an illuminator, optical modulator (will be referred to simply as &ldquo;modulator&rdquo; hereunder) illuminated by light from the illuminator, and a projection lens which forms the modulated light from the modulator into an image. The conventional image display apparatus uses a discharge lamp as the light source of the illuminator, and a liquid crystal as the modulator, and has a relatively large size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Since the image display apparatus of the above type adopts a color filter for each pixel of one modulator and a so-called sequential color display method by which an image is displayed in colors on the time-shared basis, so it is inexpensive. However, the apparatus is not advantageous in that it cannot utilized light efficiently and consumes much power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The reason why the apparatus cannot utilize the light with a high efficiency is that since the modulator is a non-luminous element which modulates the polarized state of incident light, a means is needed which splits a light beam emitted from a light source into rays of light according to the polarized state of each ray and then recombines the split rays of light together, the light source emits light even when an image is displayed in black, which is different from a luminous-type image display apparatus, and the apparatus loses light correspondingly to an light-utilization efficiency which depends upon the numerical aperture of the modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For a higher efficiency of light utilization in the conventional image display apparatus, the following are done by the optical elements etc. included in the image display apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Splitting and recombination of polarized light components&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> conventional image display apparatus is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view. The above-mentioned means for splitting a light beam emitted from a light source in an illuminator into rays of light according to the polarized state of each ray and then recombining the split rays of light together is known as a polarized-state converter. As shown, the illuminator used in the image display apparatus includes a light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, modulator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> provided, as the polarized-state converter, between the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Namely, a glass block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is prepared by attaching glass plates <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> each having formed thereon a polarized component splitting layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed from a multilayer film of an inorganic substance and glass plates <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> each having a reflecting surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> formed thereon alternately to each other. The glass block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> thus formed is sliced along cutting planes <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> laid obliquely in relation to the joined surfaces of the glass plates <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to make P-S converter plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A light beam being a mixture of P- and S-polarized components, projected onto the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, is separated by the polarized component splitting layer into P- and S-polarized components. So, the P- and S-polarized components split by each of the layers of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> will go out of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. With a half-wave (&lgr;/2) plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provided at a portion of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at which the light will go out and corresponding to either the S- or P-polarized ray of light, the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> provides a light beam including solely either the P- or S-polarized component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Use of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and half-wave plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as a polarized component splitter permits to improve the efficiency of light utilization of the illuminator used to illuminate the modulator which modulates polarized components of an incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the above illuminator, a light beam emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is reflected by a parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and incident upon the P-S converter <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through a pair of fly-eye lenses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Then, it passes through the half-wave (&lgr;/2) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a condenser lens <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and reaches the modulator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Reflecting polarizer&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The conventional polarizer allows only one of two types of polarized components of an incident light to pass through while absorbing the other type of polarized component. However, there has been proposed a &ldquo;reflecting polarizer&rdquo; which allows one of two types of polarized components of an incident light to pass through while reflecting, not absorbing, the other type of polarized component. Use of such a &ldquo;reflecting polarizer&rdquo; as the polarized-state converter permits to utilize the other type of polarized component of the incident light by reflecting it again, that is, to improve the efficiency of light utilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Linear polarizer using a birefringent multilayer film&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, there has been proposed a linear polarizer using a birefringent multilayer film formed by laminating two types of polymer films each being anisotropic in refractive index and different in refractive index from each other and elongating the laminated films. In the linear polarizer, the laminated two types of polymer films are completely coincident in refractive index with each other in the direction of one of axes of polarization while being not coincident in the direction of the other polarization axis. By adjusting the different refractive indexes, it is possible to pass the polarized light in the direction of one of the polarization axes while reflecting the polarized light in the direction of the other polarization axis perpendicular to the one polarization axis. Thus, the &ldquo;reflecting polarizer&rdquo; can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Note that the above &ldquo;reflecting polarizer&rdquo; is commercially available from the 3M under the trade name &ldquo;DBEF&rdquo; or &ldquo;HMF&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Circular polarizer using a cholestetric liquid crystal&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As well known, the cholesteric liquid crystal selectively reflects light beams. There has been proposed a circular polarizer utilizing the property of the cholesteric liquid crystal to selectively reflect light beams. As disclosed in the Japanese Published Unexamined Application No. 281814 of 1994, since the cholesteric liquid crystal has a pitch varying by more than 100 nm, it can selectively reflect light beams having wavelengths over the visible range. Also, a wavelength-independent circular polarizer can be produced using such a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The circular polarizer formed from the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer and polarized-state converter using the circular polarizer are known from he disclosure in the Japanese Patent Gazette No. 2,509,372. The invention disclosed in this Gazette utilizes the fact that because of the characteristic of the circularly polarized light, namely, since the phase changes 180 deg. per reflection, a right-hand circularly polarized light is converted to a left-hand one while a left-hand circularly polarized light is converted to a right-hand one. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the reflector or parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be combined with a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to build a polarized component splitting/recombination unit. The polarized component splitting/recombination unit using the above linear polarization needs a half-wave (&lgr;/2) plate, but the polarized component splitting/recombination unit using the circular polarization needs no such half-wave plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a light beam emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is incident upon the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through a condenser lens <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, while being reflected by the reflector or parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and incident upon the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through the condenser lens <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. At the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the circularly polarized light in one direction will be allowed to pass through while the circularly polarized light in the other direction will be reflected. The circularly polarized light in the other direction, thus reflected by the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, is reflected by the reflector or parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to a circularly polarized light in the one direction, incident again upon the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and passed through the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional image display apparatus including the aforementioned illuminator is not advantageous in the following respects: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Manufacturing process&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned illuminator can only be manufactured in a complicated process and with high costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Problems of the circular polarizer using the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The circular polarizer disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese Published Unexamined Application No. 281814 of 1994 are independent of any light wavelength, but cannot be said to satisfactorily split an incident light into polarized components. Therefore, to provide an image having a required contrast, the illuminator has to be used in combination with an absorbing polarizer (where one of the polarized components is allowed to pass through while the other polarized component is absorbed). Thus, it is difficult to utilize light with an improved efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Problems of the polarized component separator using the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The illuminators shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese Patent Gazette No. 2,509,372 and Japanese Published Unexamined Application No. 281814 of 1994, respectively, are not always effective as expected when it is built in the form of a combination of a discharge lamp used as a light source in practice and a reflector or when it is used to illuminate the modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> used with the discharge lamp has the actual sectional form of a paraboloid of revolution or an ellipsoid of revolution, and so a light beam reflected by a polarized component splitter formed from the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> towards the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will be reflected twice by the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. On the assumption that the light beam has a phase change of 180 deg. when it is reflected once by the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the phase change of 180 deg. given to the light beam reflected once will be canceled, namely, the light beam once reflected will have no phase change, when it is reflected once again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, since the P- and S-polarized components of light are reflected with one reflectance and another, respectively, by the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and they are changed in phase and scattered when they pass through the glass tube of the discharge lamp as the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, so the polarized-state conversion will be less effective. Also, when the reflector is a parabolic mirror, a light beam emitted from the focal point will return to that point after it is reflected by a reflecting polarizer, but a light beam emitted from other than the focal point will not always return to that point after it is reflected by the reflecting polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when a spheroidal mirror is used as the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the reflected light from the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> will not return, to the point of light emission of the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> but will be absorbed by the electrodes of the discharge lamp and have the angular distribution thereof spread after it is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which depends upon the position of the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The spread angular distribution will increase the Etendue of the light source, which will cause the efficiency of light utilization to be lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As above, the polarized-state converter in the conventional illuminator is disadvantageous in efficiency of light utilization and manufacturing cost, and cannot return light to the light source with any adequate efficiency. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art by providing an image display apparatus including a non-luminous modulator, illuminator to illuminate the optical modulator and a projection lens, and which is simply constructed, thus easy to produce and can utilize light with an improved efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Note that through the accompanying drawings, like parts are indicated with corresponding references. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;General-purpose illuminator&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of a block diagram the projection-type image display apparatus according to the present invention. The image display apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes a general-purpose illuminator using an optical modulator (will be referred to simply as &ldquo;modulator&rdquo; hereunder) which modulates a polarized state of an incident light. As shown, the basic illuminator includes a light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, polarized-state converter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Illumination light emitted from the illuminator is incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Also, in some cases, there is provided a color separator between the polarized-state converter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> correspondingly to the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for display of an image in three primary colors (R, G and B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided to uniform the light intensity distribution within the light beam emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The polarized-state converter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> splits the light beam emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into polarized components and recombines the thus split polarized components. The condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided to illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> efficiently by the light beam from the integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is, the condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> forms the light from the integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into an image on the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Outline of the image display apparatus according to the present invention&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the image display apparatus further includes a first reflecting element provided to reflect the unwanted light of the light beam emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, not illuminating the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, towards the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a second reflecting element provided to reflect the light beam once reflected by the first reflecting element toward the modulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Since these reflecting elements permit to reuse the unwanted light as illumination light, so they permit to display an image more brightly without having to increase the light-emission power of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned illuminator permitting to reuse the unwanted light as illumination light will be referred to as &ldquo;recycle-type illuminator&rdquo; hereunder. According to the present invention, the following image display apparatuses can be build using the &ldquo;recycle-type illuminator&rdquo;: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> (1) Image display apparatus with polarizing recycle-type illuminator </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> (2) Image display apparatus with illuminator capable of effectively improving numerical aperture of modulator </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Basic type of recycle-type illuminator&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the recycle-type illuminator includes an illumination optical system consisting of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, polarized-state converter (not shown) and the condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and also a first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this illuminator, the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a discharge lamp provided with a parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is a reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having the sectional form of a paraboloid of revolution. The light-emission point of the discharge lamp is laid at the focal point of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a fly-eye integrator which is a combination of a first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is followed by the polarized-state converter (not shown). The condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> consists of a condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is shown as a plane mirror laid perpendicularly to the optic axis of the illuminator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Note that in the following description, the light beam traveling from the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be referred to as &ldquo;primary light&rdquo; while the light beam having been reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be referred to as &ldquo;recycled light&rdquo;. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the typical rays of the primary light are indicated with solid lines, and the recycled light corresponding to the primary light is indicated with a dashed line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the primary light emitted from the point of light emission of the discharge lamp is laid at the focal point of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the primary light emitted from the light-emission point is reflected by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be a collimated beam which will be perpendicularly incident upon the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator. Then, the primary light is converged by each of segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and condensed onto each of segments of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. That is, the light-source image carried by the primary light is formed on each of the segments of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The primary light reaches the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this illumination optical system, the central rays of light are parallel to the optic axis, namely, perpendicular to the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. That is, the illumination optical system is a telecentric optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It should be reminded that each of the segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is conjugate with the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is conjugate with the light-emission point of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, each of the segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> works as a diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> returns to the fly-eye integrator. Of the recycled light, a light beam passed through a zone of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> within which the primary light has passed and that has also passed through the corresponding first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, will be focused at the point of light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Note that since actually the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is limited in size and a glass bulb forming the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will shade the light beam, the recycled light will be shaded in the process of returning to the point of light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Illuminator permitting to recycle light with improved efficiency&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a side elevation of the illuminator included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis of the illuminator, and a reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided as a second reflecting element, whereby the illumination light can be recycled with an improved efficiency. The illuminator includes an illumination optical system consisting of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, polarized-state converter (not shown) and the condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and also the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this illuminator, the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a discharge lamp provided with a spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having the sectional form of an ellipsoid of revolution, and its light-emission point is at the focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is an assembly of two lenses: condenser lens (relay lens) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> serving also as a diaphragm is laid at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed from a highly reflective material, and has a pattern of apertures corresponding to rays of light going out of segments, respectively, of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the second integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The image-side focal point of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set near the field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this illumination optical system, the central ray of light is parallel to the optic axis, namely, perpendicular to the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. That is, the illumination optical system is a telecentric optical system. Since the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis of the illumination optical system, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> returns to a position off the aperture pattern of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which will reflect the reflected recycled light. The recycled light thus reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> returns to the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the typical rays of the primary light are indicated with solid lines, and the path of the recycled light corresponding to the primary light is indicated with a dashed line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Also, the illuminator may be constructed with the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being shifted an appropriate distance as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The appropriate distance of the optic axis shift is nearly a quarter of the pitch between the segments of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the typical rays of the primary light are indicated with solid lines, and the path of the recycled light corresponding to the primary light is indicated with a dashed line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the illuminators shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, respectively, the diameter of the aperture of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generally depends upon the Etendue of an object to be illuminated by light from the illuminated, but it is determined taking in consideration the aspect ratio of the to-be-illuminated object and efficiency of light recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Also, the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are positioned to be generally conjugate with each other. That is, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> defines, on the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a light intensity distribution different from that formed by the primary light, and the illumination pattern of each segment of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is superposed on the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, when the segments of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> have the same rectangular shape, the illumination pattern formed by the recycled light on the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be a rectangular one in which the illumination of the central aperture corresponding to each of the segments is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Also, the pattern of the reflected light from the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> results in similar patterns on the segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. When the image-side focal point of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is coincident with that of the condenser lens group <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the reflected light from the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> returns to a position symmetric with the coincident position with respect to the optic axis after reaching the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In case the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is laid symmetrically with respect to the optic axis, the symmetric pattern of the reflected light pattern will be formed on each of the segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with the result that the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is illuminated with the illumination being not uniformed. To uniform the illumination, the field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> should be spaced from each other. Since the rays of light other than the central one are not symmetric at the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so the illumination of the recycled light can be uniformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The illuminator may be composed of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> laid at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> laid near the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in this order as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this case, the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be shifted in parallel to the basic optic axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is open at the center thereof. Namely, it works as a diaphragm for the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In this illuminator, the recycled light reflected by the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> passes through the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and returns to the light-emission point of the light source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and returns to the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the typical rays of the primary light are indicated with solid lines and the path of the recycled light corresponding to the primary light is indicated with a dashed line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First reflecting element&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The first reflecting element has not to be any dedicated element. An element usable to reflect unwanted light for any other purpose may be employed as the first reflecting element. Namely, the first reflecting element may be any one of a reflecting polarizer, polarization beam splitter, shading layer, reflecting layer of a reflecting modulator, reflective color filter or the like. It will be described later where it should be positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Requirements for improvement of recycling efficiency&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The requirements for improvement of the efficiency of recycling the illumination light includes the following four: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> (1) The first reflecting element and integrator should be optically conjugate with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> (2) The illuminator components should reflect as little as possible at the surfaces thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (3) The illuminator should be constructed to efficiently reflect the return light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (4) The Etendue of the modulator should be so large as to allow the light source Etendue to increase in the process of light recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The first requirement is as having previously been described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> To meet the above second requirement, it is necessary to form an anti-reflection coating on each optical component and minimize the reflecting surface by integrally forming parts which could be formed integrally with each other. For example, the discharge lamp bulb should desirably have such an anti-reflection coating formed on the glass surface thereof. Also, the P-S converter, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> should be laid optically close to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The third requirement will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;Etendue of the modulator&rdquo; in the fourth requirement is represented by a product of an illuminated area of the modulator and a solid angle of the illumination light, and the &ldquo;Etendue of the light source&rdquo; is represented by a product of an area of light emission and a solid angle of the light emission. For example, in a light source consisting of a parabolic mirror and discharge lamp bulb, the &ldquo;Etendue of the light source&rdquo; is a product of an opening area of the parabolic mirror and an emission solid angle of the outgoing light at the opening of the parabolic mirror. The Etendue of the modulator will increase as the unwanted light is returned to the light source and reflected back towards the modulator. In case the Etendue of the modulator is smaller than that of the light source, the recycled light will illuminate a zone larger than a one intended to be illuminated and the efficiency of recycling will be smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Construction of the light source for improved efficiency of recycling (1)&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Generally, in case the light source is provided with the parabolic mirror as above, the recycled light will not precisely coincide in position and angle with the primary light when the unwanted light returns to the opening of the parabolic mirror. Also, when the optical elements have been misaligned with each other in the process of manufacturing, the recycled light will not return to the light-emission point of the light source. The light source improved in these respects is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> which is an axial-sectional view of the first embodiment of the light source included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the light source with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> additionally includes a protective glass (face plate) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided at the open end of the mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and having reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided as the second reflecting element on the front side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or rear side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thereof. The reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are positioned at the center and along the periphery, respectively, of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Each of them may be a thin film or dielectric multilayer film of a metallic material such as aluminum, silver or the like formed on the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, they may be reflectors separate from the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and located in the vicinity of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Note that the light-emission point is within the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (glass tube) having an anti-reflection coating <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed on the surface of the glass tube thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Generally, in the light source consisting of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the entire open end of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is not effective as the light source but the center and periphery of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are ineffective zones where the illumination light reflected by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will not be transmitted, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Namely, the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided in such ineffective zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>should desirably be formed as close to the light-emission point of the light source as possible because a larger part of the recycled light will be shaded by the glass tube of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> if the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are apart from the light-emission point as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. To avoid this, the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>should more desirably be positioned closer to the light-emission point, by forming them on the rear side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, than formed on the front side <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Also, the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>should desirably be positioned closer to the effective zone of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are far from the effective zone of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the unwanted primary light (light emitted directly from the light-emission point) cannot be shaded sufficiently and thus a larger part of the reflected light to be returned towards the light source will be reflected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Also note that the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed along the periphery of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be laid obliquely at an appropriate angle with the optic axis as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. That is, in this case, the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed to be a part of a conical or spherical surface. In case the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is not laid so obliquely, the light beam reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be incident upon a large radial zone of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. By positioning the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>obliquely in relation to the optic axis, it is possible to prevent the light beam reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from diverging through the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the oblique angle of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>depends upon the relation in magnitude between the focal distance of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and size of the light-emission point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Construction of the light source for improved efficiency of recycling (2)&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Also in case the light source is composed of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which replaces the aforementioned parabolic mirror, and the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed on the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and in an ineffective zone where the primary light is not allowed to pass through, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> which is an axial-sectional view of a fifth embodiment of the light source included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. That is, the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed at the center and along the periphery, respectively, of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Different from the parabolic mirror, however, it is not sufficient for improvement of the efficiency of light recycling to form the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>solely on the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The reason is that since the light-emission point of the light source is positioned at the first focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so light (primary light) emitted from the light-emission point will be focused at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, to recycle the light effectively and efficiently, it is necessary to focus the light beam reflected by the reflectors at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To this end, condenser lenses <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided in close proximity to the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. The condenser lenses <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are a circular lens and a toroidal lens, respectively, corresponding to the reflectors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. The circular lens is positioned at the center of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> while the toroidal lens is positioned along the periphery of the protective lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Their focal points are coincident with the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The recycled light caused by the condenser lenses <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to pass through the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> becomes telecentric at the first reflecting element as having previously been described. Therefore, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element returns to the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and thereafter it becomes an effective light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Construction of the light source for improved efficiency of recycling (3)&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the sixth embodiment of the light source included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the light source may be composed of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a quarter-wave (&lgr;/4) plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As above, the phase change in the light reflection by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is not always 180 deg. but it will also vary depending upon the incident angle or wavelength. To accommodate this fact, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are used in this light source to make a P- or S-polarization of the light in relation to the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is divided into plural (an even number of) radial zones <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; symmetric with each other with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The phase-retardation axis of each of these radial zones forms an angle of 45 deg. with a straight line connecting the center of each radial zone and the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and is perpendicular to the phase-retardation axis of the radial zones which are symmetric with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that an ultraviolet- and infrared-cut filter (not shown) is provided between the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be a one formed from a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer. The quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should desirably be a one which works in a wide-band domain of wavelength. It should be noted that an anti-reflection coating is applied on the surface of contact with air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The outgoing light from the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is linearly polarized by the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when it passes through the latter, and reaches the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. At this time, the light will be P- or S-polarized in relation to the incident surface of the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, the polarized light in one direction is reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> towards the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The reflected light from the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is passed through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, reflected twice by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and then reaches the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> again. At this time, the light is incident upon a zone (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, for example) of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, symmetric with a zone (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example) of the same plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, through which the light has passed when reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, since the light has already passed through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is P- or S-polarized without incurring any phase difference. Therefore, passed through the zone of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, orthogonal to the phase-retardation axis, the light is circularly polarized in a direction opposite to that in which it has initially been incident upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and thus passes through the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In the light source, the polarized state is changed or converted in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Note that in the light source shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed integrally with the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed integrally with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, but they may be formed separately from the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> However, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should desirably be laid as close to the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as possible. If it is laid apart from the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a light beam having a large angle with the optic axis, having been reflected twice by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and reached the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> again, will not be more likely to pass through the symmetric zones of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Also, the more the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is apart from the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the reflected light from the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will be more likely to reach the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the periphery. In this case, the reflected light will not pass through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> but will be incident as a circularly polarized light upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the light is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, its phase is changed by 180 deg. to provide an opposite-directional circularly polarized light which will pass through the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the light is not reflected by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or influenced in any way by the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so the illumination light will possibly be recycled with an improved efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Note that similarly to the aforementioned combination of the quarter-wave plate and circular polarizer, a combination of a half-wave plate and a reflecting linear polarizer may provide a light source which can work similarly to the aforementioned light source. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the first embodiment of the illuminator included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the light source may be composed of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In case of the light source with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the light beam off the focal point of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and incident again upon the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will possibly be shaded by a shade such as the electrode of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. To avoid this possibility in the light source with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the light-emission point of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located at the first focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is located nearly at a point of conjugation with the reflecting point on the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The incident light upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is set telecentric by the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The light beam reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is reflected by the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> back to the position at which the primary light has been reflected. The reflected light from the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> returns to a position symmetric with the light-emission point with respect to the first focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Namely, the light beam is less shaded by the discharge electrode of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As in the aforementioned &ldquo;Construction of the light source for improved efficiency of recycling (3)&rdquo;, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is divided into plural radial zones different in direction of phase-retardation axis from each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, and it is laid in the vicinity of the protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Even when disposed between the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will provide the same effect as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should desirably be a one which can work in a wide-band domain of wavelength. Also, an ultraviolet- and infrared-cut filter (not shown) is provided between the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and protective glass <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the second embodiment of the illuminator included in the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be a one made of a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer. It should be noted that an anti-reflection coating <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is applied on the air-contact surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The outgoing light from the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is linearly polarized by the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when it passes through the latter, and is incident upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. At this time, the light will be P- or S-polarized in relation to the incident surface of the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, the polarized light in one direction is reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> towards the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The reflected light from the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is passed through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, reflected twice by the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then incident again upon the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At this time, the light is incident upon a zone (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, for example) of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> symmetric with a zone (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example) of the same plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, through which the light has passed when reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, since the light has already passed through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is P- or S-polarized without incurring any phase difference. Therefore, passing through the zone of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, orthogonal to the phase-retardation axis, the light is circularly polarized in a direction opposite to that in which it has initially been incident upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and passes through the latter. Thus, the polarized state is converted in the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Note that similarly to the aforementioned combination of the quarter-wave plate and circular polarizer, a combination of a half-wave plate and a reflecting linear polarizer may provide a light source which can work similarly to the aforementioned light source. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the illuminator used in the image display apparatus according to the present invention includes the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> constructed as having been illustrated and described in the foregoing, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this illuminator, each of the segments of the fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a diaphragm for each of segments of the corresponding fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Namely, the light beams passing through the segments of the corresponding second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are all focused on an object to be illuminated. Actually, however, not the entire diaphragm is utilized but the diaphragm has ineffective zones where the illumination is low as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. In this illuminator, such ineffective zones on the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are utilized effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the above illuminator has the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided, as a second reflecting element, between the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that in case the P-S converter exists as above, the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided between the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the P-S converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed where it will not shade the primary light from the light source. More particularly, the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed to have an aperture pattern whose configuration corresponds to the light intensity distribution on the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> or to have a stripe structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In this illuminator, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be returned again to the to-be-illuminated object by returning it to any zone other than the aperture of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and it can thus be utilized efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Since the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is laid at the side, nearer to the light-source, of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will form together a relay-condenser illumination optical system for the recycled light. The condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> works as a relay lens. Also, the optical system is a telecentric one for the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Namely, the central ray of the light beam is parallel to the optic axis of the optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In case the recycled light reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has been reflected again by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it retraces the optical path along which the primary light has traveled and returns to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. With this process repeatedly done, the illumination light is recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis. The first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is horizontally or vertically oblique in relation to the optic axis. When the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is horizontally oblique, the light intensity distribution of the recycled light on the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is such that bright zones appear shifted laterally from the aperture pattern of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as indicated with dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. When the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is vertically oblique, the light intensity distribution of the recycled light on the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is such that the bright zones appear shifted longitudinally from the aperture pattern of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as indicated with dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> A part of the light thus returning to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be outside the profile of the second fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the light returning to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be wholly collected with the use of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a larger outside diameter. Also, since a part of the light returning to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, overlapping the aperture pattern indicated with solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, returns to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the aperture pattern, it will not be lost but will be reused as the illumination light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Also, the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may not be laid obliquely relative to the optic axis but may be shifted along with the condenser lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a predetermined distance in parallel to the optic axis,. It should be noted that the predetermined distance of shifting of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in relation to the optic axis is about a quarter of the pitch between the fly-eye lens segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Note that the surface of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> should desirably be superior in flatness for an improved efficiency of recycling the illumination light. However, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, having a pattern which will be defined by inverting the aperture pattern of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, returns to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, for a uniform illumination by the recycled light, the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have an appropriate light-scattering surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Further, the illuminator may include two fly-eye integrators <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. In this case, the recycled light can have an improved uniformity of illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of segments generally similar to the object to be illuminated. The second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> laid between the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be different in shape from the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms the relay-condenser illumination optical system in which the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the second reflecting element is located in a zone near the diaphragm and where it will not shade the primary light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Also, the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is shifted about a quarter of the pitch between the segments of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in relation to the optic axis of the other optical system. The first and second fly-eye integrators <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are set different in segment pitch from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In this illuminator, the recycled light reflected by the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forms a reflected-light pattern on each of the segments of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since the second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is different in segment pitch from the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the recycled light incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is reflected by the latter. When the reflected recycled light is incident again upon the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it forms a pattern different from that which has initially been formed when it returns to the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the recycled light passes through the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and it incident upon the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At this time, the recycled light will have the illumination thereof uniformed. </paragraph>

The fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is laid between the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a zone where it will work with both the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed in a position at the side, nearer to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, symmetric with the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In the above illuminator, a part of the primary light having reached the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is incident, as a recycled light, upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> disposed at the side, nearer to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and uniformed by the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to illuminate the to-be-illuminated object with a high efficiency. </paragraph>

As shown, the illuminator may include a rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a prismatic optical device made of a transparent material. The light beam is incident upon one end of the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and goes out from the other end. This illuminator is constructed out of a light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a relay-condenser optical system laid between the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The relay-condenser optical system includes a condenser lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and relay lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The condenser lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is located at the second focal point of the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the relay lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is at the focal point of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an aperture formed therein is provided near one end of the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, upon which the light beam from a light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is incident. The reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed on the end face, nearer to the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, of the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

Thus, the recycled light having returned to a part, other than the aperture, of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly to the primary light, the reflected light beam from the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is uniformed by the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to illuminate the to-be-illuminated object with a high efficiency.

Also, the image display apparatus includes the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as a reflecting polarizer. Thus, it has a function as a polarized-state converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the image display apparatus includes the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, disposed in this order at predetermined intervals. The reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis. The angulation of the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is such that as mentioned above, when the recycled light reflected by the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> returns to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it will be incident mainly upon an ineffective part of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, off the aperture patten of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be made of a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer. Also, by forming an anti-reflection coating on the air-contact surface of a substrate on which the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer is formed, it is possible to improve the polarized component splitting as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, it is presumed that the range of selective reflection by the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer is set within a range of 420 to 690 nm. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference> shows the spectral transmittance of left-hand circularly polarized light when the anti-reflection coating is formed on the reflecting circular polarizer, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference> shows the spectral transmittance of right-hand circularly polarized light when the anti-reflection coating is formed on the reflecting circular polarizer, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31C</cross-reference> shows the spectral transmittance of left-hand circularly polarized light when the anti-reflection coating is not formed on the reflecting circular polarizer, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31D</cross-reference> shows the spectral transmittance of right-hand circularly polarized light when the anti-reflection coating is not formed on the reflecting circular polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The illumination light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is passed through the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, aperture pattern of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. One circularly polarized light passes through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while the other is reflected by the polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</cross-reference>. The reflected circularly polarized light returns to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and is reflected by the latter to be an oppotiste-directional circularly polarized light. This light is incident again upon the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passes through the latter. The light thus passed through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> where it will undergo spatial modulation according to an image to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Note that when linearly polarized light has to be incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a quarter-wave plate should be provided between the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Also, by additionally providing an absorbing polarizer, it is possible to shade unwanted polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Also, the reflecting polarizer may be a reflecting linear polarizer. In this case, the quarter-wave plate is provided on the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or at the side, nearer to the light source, of the reflecting linear polarizer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the second embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the image display apparatus may be composed of the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> including the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> provided in this order at predetermined intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In the above image display apparatus, the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be made of a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer. Also, the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is divided into plural (an even number of) radial zones <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>&prime; symmetric with each other with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The phase-retardation axis of each of these radial zones forms an angle of 45 deg. with a straight line connecting the center of each radial zone and the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and is perpendicular to the phase-retardation axis of the radial zones which are symmetric with each other with respect to the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is passed through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, one circularly polarized component of the light is allowed to pass through while the other circularly polarized component is reflected towards the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Since the second fly-eye lens of the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is conjugate with the light emitter (lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so the reflected light from the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> returns to the light emitter (lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Thus, the light returning towards the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is converted to a linearly polarized light when passing through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and then incident upon the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The phase-retardation axis of the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is directed at an angle of 45 deg. with a straight line connecting the center of each area and the center axis of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, that is, the incident surface of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, the linearly polarized light after returning from the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passing through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is P- or S-polarized in relation to the incident surface of the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The light is reflected twice by the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> without incurring any phase change, and passes through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The light having passed three times through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as above will be circularly polarized in a direction in which it will pass through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the reflected light from the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is recycled, and thus the light changed in polarized state after passing through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be utilized with an improved efficiency. </paragraph>

The optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shifted in parallel to that of the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this image display apparatus, the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provide the function of polarized-state conversion. As in the aforementioned embodiment, the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made of a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The illumination light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is passed through the relay lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which allows one circularly polarized component to pass through it while reflecting the other circularly polarized component, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</cross-reference>. The reflected polarized light is incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The light is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to be an opposite-directional circularly polarized light. This light is incident again upon the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passes through the latter. The light thus passed through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in which it will undergo spatial modulation according to an image to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Note that when a linearly polarized light has to be incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a quarter-wave plate should be provided between the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Also, by additionally providing an absorbing polarizer, it is possible to cut off unwanted polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Also, the reflecting polarizer may be a reflecting linear polarizer.

As shown, each of the embodiments of the image display apparatus includes the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an aperture, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and also the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> provided at the lateral side of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shifted in parallel to that of the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Also, a quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided between the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In this image display apparatus, the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides the function of polarized-state conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A, a</cross-reference> reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as viewed from the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided at the lateral side of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as above. The reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are located to have an equal optical path length from the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, namely, from the inner reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the above image display apparatus, the outgoing light from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is passed through the illumination optical system to the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The illumination light is split by the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into S- and P-polarized light beams. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>B, the S-polarized light is reflected at the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while the P-polarized light is passed through the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by which it will be reflected. The recycled light reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> retraces the optical path, passes through a quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and passes through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> again. The light is S-polarized by the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and incident again upon the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. At this time, since the recycled light is S-polarized in relation to the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is reflected at the reflecting plane to illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Note that the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should desirably be shifted in a direction in which the distance between the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will not change as the optic axis is shifted, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>C, in order to allow the angle of incidence of the light beam to increase correspondingly to an optic axis movement. Also, owing to this construction, the peak brightness which will be described in detail later can be effectively improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> In case an intended optical extinction ratio cannot be attained by a single beam splitter, an auxiliary polarization beam splitter may be additionally provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</cross-reference>. That is, in the above image display apparatus, the reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is located following two polarization beam splitters <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> laid downstream of the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is located at the lateral side of the second polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Also, an optical path length adjusting block <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided at the lateral side of the first polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a reflector <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is provided at the lateral side of the optical path length adjusting block <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. These reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and reflector <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are located to have an equal optical path length from the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, namely, from the inner reflecting planes of the polarization beam splitters <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, respectively. The two polarization beam splitters <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are in such a geometric relation that the light beams are reflected by the planes of reflection in orthogonal directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, the recycled light can be returned to the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as in the image display apparatus having been illustrated and described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>A, and the two tandem polarization beam splitters can attain a larger optical extinction ratio. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In the above image display apparatus, the illumination light is separated by the color separation prims <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> into the three primary colors (R, G and B), the modulators <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>modulate the separated colors according to R (red), G (green) and B (blue), respectively, of an image to be displayed, and the light beams passed through these modulators <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are recombined to display the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Note that since the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shifted in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>), so the optic-axis shifting is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> but the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is similar in construction to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 35A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 38</cross-reference>, there are schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the seventh and eighth embodiments of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. Each image display apparatus may additionally include a P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and have the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed from color filter layers each made of an interference filter and located corresponding to each pixel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 38</cross-reference>. The image display apparatus includes the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an aperture pattern, P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> located in this order. It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</cross-reference> shows an axial-section of the illuminator horizontally viewed and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference> shows an axial-section vertically viewed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>B, the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> As having previously been described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed as follows. Namely, a glass block is prepared by attaching glass plates each having formed thereon a polarized component separating layer formed from a multilayer film of an inorganic substance and glass plates each having a reflecting surface formed thereon alternately to each other, and the thus formed glass block is sliced along cutting planes being at an angle to the joined surfaces of the glass plates. The slice is used as the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When a light beam of a mixture of P- and S-polarized components is incident upon the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the P- and S-polarized components are separated at the polarized component separating layer. Namely, the P- and S-polarized components are separated at each layer of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and go out of the latter. By placing a half-wave (&lgr;/2) plate at the side of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, corresponding to the P- or S-polarized component and from which the light goes out, a light beam including solely either the P- or S-polarized component can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes a transparent substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a layer in which reflecting shading layers <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and reflective color filters <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are alternately arranged, a transparent electrode <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, an oriented layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, an oriented layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and an oriented TFT substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> located in this order. The reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is an interference filter or the like to allow predetermined color light to pass through and reflect unwanted color light other than the predetermined color light without absorbing them. </paragraph>

These reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and reflective shading layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and also the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, are laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis. The reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and reflective shading layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are oblique in a direction rotated about a direction perpendicular to the length of the attachment surface of the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, unwanted component of the primary light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and not passed through each reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and reflective shading layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. For example, the color filter for R (red) reflects B (blue) and G (green) color light which will return as recycled light to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This is also true for the color filters for the other colors. The light beam having thus returned to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and reflected by the latter is incident again upon a position symmetric with respect to the optic axis of the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. At this time, the recycled light will not always return to the filter for the same color as that when the light has been reflected as the unwanted light. So, the illumination light is recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Note that in the illuminators shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 38</cross-reference>, the P-S converter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is of a conventional construction but it may be a reflecting polarizer. In this case, the reflecting polarizer should be laid with the oblique direction thereof being perpendicular to that of the layer including the reflective color filter and reflective shading layer (namely, the oblique direction of the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). Also, use of a light source with a quarter-wave plate divided into plural radial zones (even number of radial zones) symmetric with respect to the optic axis makes it unnecessary to use any P-S converter. Since use of a P-S converter will not increase the Etendue of the modulator in this case, the reflection by the reflective color filter improves the efficiency of light recycling. That is, the above illuminator will be effective when the modulator has no sufficient Etendue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Also, the oblique setting of the modulator will result in that the modulator is set obliquely in relation to the optic axis of a projection lens (not shown) which forms the image of the modulator on the screen. If the oblique setting of the modulator in relation to the optic axis of the projection lens degrades the imaging characteristic on the screen, the optic axis of the projection lens may be set oblique correspondingly to the oblique angle of the modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Further, the reflective color filter may be made of a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer layer of which the helical pitch is adjusted correspondingly to each pixel. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the eighth embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the image display apparatus includes the illuminator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> divided into plural (an even number of) radial zones symmetric with respect to the optic axis, relay lens block <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> consisting of two pieces between them a toroidal reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a central opening and a quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, quarter-wave reflector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> laid in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to that of the optical system laid down to the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, there is provided at the lateral side of the polarized bam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> the reflecting modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed from an interference filter whose color filter layers are laid correspondingly to pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In the above image display apparatus, S-polarized light from the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> illuminates the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which will provide a modulated P-polarized light. The P-polarized light is passed through the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and projected onto a projection lens (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in this image display apparatus is constructed out of a substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, transparent electrode <highlight><bold>5244</bold></highlight>, oriented layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, oriented layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, reflective electrode and an active matrix substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> provided in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Also, in the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the reflective electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> should desirably formed correspondingly to the effective pixel range and a reflector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> desirably be formed in the ineffective range along the effective pixel range, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. The range in which the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is to be illuminated is generally defined large than the effective matrix range for the tolerance of assembling precision. Also, by forming the reflector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to be larger than the range of illumination, it is also possible to recycle the illumination light projected upon the ineffective range other than the display range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In the image display apparatus, the reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, reflective electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and reflector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> work together as the first reflecting element. This embodiment is intended for an improved efficiency of color utilization as well as for an improved peak brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In the image display apparatus, the light beam emitted from the lamp bulb <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is polarized in a constant direction by the polarized-state converting function of the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, namely, S-polarized in relation to the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The primary light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has the unwanted light, included therein and not passing through the reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, reflected by the color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. For example, the color filter for R (red) reflects B (blue) and G (green) color light. These reflected color light beams return to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The light incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which will linearly polarize the light. The recycled light reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes, as a circularly polarized light, through the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The recycled light is incident again upon the reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. At this time, the recycled light will not always return to the filter for the same color light as those reflected as the unwanted light. Thus, the light is recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the light not modulated by the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is returned to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> where it will be uniformed to illuminate the entire modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The light reflected again by the reflective color filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and light not modulated pass through the central opening of the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and return to the light-emission point of the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Also, of the light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and incident upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a circularly polarized in a direction in which it is reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and returns again to the light-emission point of the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. When the light is incident again upon the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it has been circularly polarized in a direction in which will pass through the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. When it passes trough the reflecting circular polarizer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and also through the quarter-wave plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, it is S-polarized in relation to the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. With the above process repeatedly done, the light is recycled with an improved efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Construction of the recycle-type sequential color image display apparatus&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view, the ninth embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the image display apparatus may be constructed out of the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an opening formed therein, P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, sequential color shutter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> located in this order as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. In this image display apparatus, the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is laid shifted in parallel to that of the optic axis of the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, a single-plate color display is implemented as in the aforementioned embodiment and the color display is made by the use of a sequential color display. That is, the sequential color shutter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> uses th reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as an analyzer therefor. In this illumination optical system, unwanted light not related with the image display at each time point is reflected by the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to return the light to the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereby it is made possible to recycle the illumination light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Construction of the illuminator for an improved peak brightness (1)&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>A, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the tenth embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, this image display apparatus may include two fly-eye integrator groups <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this case, the uniformity of the recycled light can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the image display apparatus includes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>A, the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the parabolic mirror <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> located in this order, and also the modulator (reflective liquid crystal polymer-made modulator) <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> provided at the lateral side of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The light passed through the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is projected by a projection lens <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> onto a screen <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed from an element having a similar shape to that of the to-be-illuminated object. The second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> disposed between the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be different in shape from the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms the relay-condenser illumination system, and the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the second reflecting element is laid in a zone near the aperture and where it will not shade the primary light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Also, the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shifted by about a quarter of the element pitch of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in parallel to that of the rest of the optical system. Further, the element pitch of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set different from that of the second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In the image display apparatus, the recycled light returning to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> after passing through the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> forms a pattern of reflected light on each element of the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since the element pitch of the second fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is different from that of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the recycled light is incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, reflected by the latter, and incident again upon the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At this time, the recycled light will form a pattern different from that formed when it has initially returned to the first fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the recycled light passes through the first fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is incident upon the first reflecting element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. At this time, the light has an uniformed intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, there may be provided a color separation/recombination prism to display an image in colors, or a color filter as in the aforementioned embodiment. The optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> should desirably be disclosed in a direction in which the distance between the field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the reflecting plane of the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will not be changed by shifting the optic axis. This is intended to allow an increase of the angle of light beam incidence, corresponding to the shift of the optic axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Also, the P-S converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be replaced with another polarized-state converter. For example, there may be provided the reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to reflect the light coming from the field lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and passed through the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and there may also be provided the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A and 45B</cross-reference>. The reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is laid obliquely in relation to the optic axis. The reflector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is set obliquely in a direction perpendicular to the direction of shifting the optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Further, by using a light source with a quarter-wave plate divided into plural (an even number of) radial zones symmetric with respect the optic axis, it is made unnecessary to use any P-S converter. In this case, since the Etendue will not be increased by the use of a P-S converter, the reflection of the illumination light by the reflective color filter will improve the efficiency of light recycling. That is, this measure is effective when the modulator has no sufficient Etendue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In the image display apparatus, the illumination not modulated by the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> returns as recycled light to the light source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the polarization beam splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The recycled light reflected at the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is uniformed by the fly-eye integrator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to uniformly illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Also in the above case, a bright zone within a dark displayed image can be displayed brighter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> graphically shows the variation in peak intensity of a displayed image in the eleventh embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the relation between the mean brightness and peak brightness is such that the larger the Etendue of the modulator, the larger number of times the light can be recycled and the lower the mean brightness of the display screen, the brighter the bright zone depicting an exponential ascending curve. Since the black level increases at the same rate, the contrast of the image display apparatus itself will not change. However, in case the contrast of the apparatus as a projector depends upon the increase of the black level due to the reflection of external light, it is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Note that generally, also in an illuminator including the reflecting modulator and polarization beam splitter, the unwanted light will return to the light source but if there is not any means for recycling the unwanted light by returning the light to the modulator positively and efficiently, the light cannot be recycled effectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the twelfth embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the image display apparatus includes the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an opening formed therein, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, transmissive modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and another reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as an analyzer, located in this order. The optic axis of the optical system laid downstream of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shifted in parallel to that of the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provide the function to convert the polarized state of light. As in the aforementioned embodiment, the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed from a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The illumination light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> passes through the relay lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and field lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and incident upon the reflecting polarizers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. One circularly polarized light passes through these reflecting polarizers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while the other circularly polarized light is reflected by the reflecting polarizers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The reflected light is incident upon the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and reflected by the latter to be an opposite-directional circularly polarized light. This light is incident again upon the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passes through the latter. The light thus passed through the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is incident upon the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in which it will undergo spatial modulation according to an image to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as the analyzer in the image display apparatus is a cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer formed within the modulator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>. As shown, the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes a TFT substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, oriented layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, oriented layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, transparent electrode <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> laid in this order. In addition, the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has an anti-reflection coating <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed on either side thereof. The reflecting polarizers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> laid before and after the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are opposite in direction of helicity to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In the image display apparatus, the light beam not modulated by the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> passes the latter, is reflected by the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and incident upon the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The light beam reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>becomes a counter-torsional circularly polarized light, is reflected by the reflecting polarizer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and then incident upon the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The light is uniformed by the rod integrated <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and is partially reflected by the reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided along the opening at the end of the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> while the rest of the light is returned to the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The recycled light is uniformed by the rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and changed in polarized state to uniformly illuminate the modulator <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In this image display apparatus, the liquid crystal polymer forming the modulator works in the VA mode. However, by providing a quarter-wave plate between the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer-made circular polarizer and liquid crystal layer to linearly polarize the light, the modulator may be caused to work in the TN mode or the like for the linearly polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, there is schematically illustrated in the form of an axial-sectional view the thirteenth embodiment of the image display apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the image display apparatus may include three modulators <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. That is, the image display apparatus includes the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the spheroidal mirror <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, field lens <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an opening formed therein, rod integrator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, condenser lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reflector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided in this order. In this image display apparatus, an illumination optical system is formed from the above components with the optic axis of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being shifted in parallel to that of the optical system ranging from the light source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to guide the outgoing light from the optical system to a first spectral reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> via a mirror <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
