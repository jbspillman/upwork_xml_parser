No. 60/292,122, filed May 18, 2001 and entitled &ldquo;DEVICE FOR MAINTAINING PRESSURE ON UNDER WATER VACUUM CLEANING DEVICE&rdquo;, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to devices for cleaning tanks of fluids, and in particular, to devices for cleaning swimming pools. More particularly, the present invention relates to fluid suction or vacuum systems for cleaning swimming pools, and even more particularly, to a device for maintaining contact pressure on a vacuum cleaning head against the floor of a swimming pool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Vacuum swimming pool cleaning devices are well known. In the typical application, a vacuum swimming pool cleaning head comprises a hollow fixture with an open bottom enclosing a space which may include cleaning or brush elements and which is connected to a suction or vacuum hose providing suction from the swimming pool filter pump. The suction hose draws liquid away from the head and any dirt particles and debris away from the head to the filter as the cleaning head is moved across the pool floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A common problem with such vacuum cleaning heads is that there is a tendency for the head to rise from the floor of the swimming pool, despite the application of vacuum by the filter pump. This occurs sometimes when the user moves the head, for example. This can cause dirt particles to be disturbed near the head and accordingly, not to be sucked up by the suction applied by the filter pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are a number of liquid pool cleaning devices which have been developed for assisting in maintaining contact pressure. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,783,868 to O&apos;Callahan shows such a device which is provided at the head of a brush. It uses a pivoting vane that applies pressure during forward motion and then pivots to a nonimpeding position upon backward motion. Although this device is useful for pool cleaning brushes, it is not useful for vacuum heads because the vane is located too close to the vacuum head and accordingly will create fluid dynamics which will cause dirt particles and debris on the pool floor to be moved prior to their being vacuumed by the vacuum head. Further, this device shows a device which only increases contact pressure in a forward motion and provides a non-impeding position on a backward motion. With vacuum cleaning of pools, it is common to vacuum in both forward and backward directions. Accordingly, this device would not provide additional contact pressure when moving in a backward direction. A similar device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>733</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> to Conrad. It suffers from the same problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,087 to Feinberg. This device uses flaps to allow contact pressure to be provided in one direction and then act as a check valve in the second direction so as to avoid providing contact pressure. Further, this device is provided to clean the walls of swimming pools and not the bottoms. This device also would not be adaptable to a vacuum cleaning head because the water foil thereof is attached too close to the brush head and thus could disturb debris and further, provides for only increasing the contact pressure in one direction only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other patents of interest include U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,592 to Addona, Sr. which is also a wall scrubbing device and has some as the same disadvantages of the prior art discussed above. Also see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,947 and 4,766,053 which disclose hydrofoils for vacuum cleaner heads. However, the &apos;053 patent provides for downward thrust only during the pulling stroke. The device of the &apos;947 patent provides downward thrust during both pulling and pushing strokes but in this device, as in the device of the &apos;053 patent, the hydrofoil is mounted on the vacuum cleaning head itself and can create fluid dynamics which would interfere with proper cleaning by disturbing debris on the pool floor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a vacuum cleaning device for swimming pools which assists in maintaining greater pressure on the vacuum cleaning head than is provided by the mere weight of the vacuum cleaning head and the pole attached thereto and the vacuum exerted by the filter pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore an object of the present invention to provide a vacuum cleaning device for swimming pools which increases contact pressure in both forward and backward directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is yet further an object of the present invention to provide a device for increasing contact pressure of vacuum cleaning heads in swimming pools which does not interfere with cleaning effort by creating unnecessary fluid dynamics which would cause disturbance of debris and dirt on the floor of a swimming pool prior to being vacuum cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects of the invention are achieved by an apparatus for maintaining pressure on a liquid pool vacuum cleaning device comprising: an object for attachment to the liquid pool cleaning device, the object having first and second surfaces, the first surface generating a force due to liquid pressure on the first surface causing a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device in a forward direction of the cleaning device and the second surface generating a force due to liquid pressure on the second surface causing a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device in a rearward direction of the cleaning device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the invention comprises an apparatus for maintaining pressure on a liquid pool cleaning device comprising an object for attachment to the liquid pool cleaning device, the object having first and second surfaces, the first surface generating a force due to liquid pressure on the first surface causing a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device in a forward direction of the cleaning device and the second surface generating a force due to liquid pressure on the second surface causing a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device in a rearward direction of the cleaning device, wherein the object comprises two vanes having an included angle between the vanes, one of said vanes exerting a downward force on the cleaning head in the forward direction and the second vane exerting a downward force on the cleaning head in the rearward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect, the invention comprises an apparatus for maintaining pressure on a liquid pool cleaning device comprising an object for attachment to the liquid pool cleaning device, the object being movable so that it moves into a first orientation to exert a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device when the cleaning device is moved in the forward direction and attains a second orientation to exert a downward force on the liquid pool cleaning device when the liquid pool cleaning device is moved in the rearward direction. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawing figures, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show one embodiment of a device according to the present invention for accomplishing the above objects. The device comprises in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is attached to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a swimming pool vacuum cleaner whose vacuum cleaning head is shown at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A flexible suction or vacuum hose <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled to an inlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in conventional fashion. The vacuum hose <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected in conventional fashion to a swimming pool filter pump, not shown. Typically, the hose <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to the filter skimmer inlet or other source of reduced liquid pressure or suction, as well known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be coupled to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by any suitable means, for example, by a U-bolt. In this embodiment, the vane is pivotally coupled as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> on a pivot axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which may comprise a suitable bolt, screw or other fastener. A snap fastener of any type can also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when a person is cleaning the swimming pool by moving the pole in the forward direction shown by the arrow designated F in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, force D of fluid pressure caused by the forward movement of the vacuum cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the direction F will cause the vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to firmly lie against the pole. Preferably, the vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of a rigid material such as a rigid plastic or metal which does not increase the buoyancy of the cleaning device. It may be made of a clear plastic material to minimize interference with viewing the cleaning operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a side view of the vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, firmly planted against the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when moving in the forward direction F by the force D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A show the same device but being used in a swimming pool when the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moved in a reverse direction B. As shown, the vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> pivots on its axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and comes to rest against a stop <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which prevents the vane from moving further. On the backward stroke, as shown in side view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, downward force D created by water pressure is exerted against the vane <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, causing the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and accordingly the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be pressed downwardly, increasing the contact pressure of the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the pool bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a fixed triangular structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having two upwardly directed surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are provided. The structure may be closed by end surfaces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in which case the bottom surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to allow water to enter. Holes are also preferably provided along the top corner at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the two surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to allow any air to escape within the inner chamber created by the triangular structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) are not necessary if the triangular structure does not include end walls <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> since fluid can easily enter from the open sides into the volume below the surfaces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Also, holes <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are not necessary if ends <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are open and if the top corner <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have an arcuate surface with the corners <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> being higher than the central portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The triangular structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be attached to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via any attachment means, for example, U-bolts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through bracket members <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> attached to the triangular structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of this structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that has closed ends <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and having a bottom surface including holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to allow fluid to enter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a top view of the device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> show, respectively, how the device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> operates on a forward motion of the vacuum cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown by the arrow F in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and on a rearward motion shown by arrow B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A downward force is exerted as shown by the arrow D on the surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as the pole is moved in the forward direction F. This causes the contact pressure of the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> against the bottom surface of the pool to be increased. On a backward motion, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and as indicated by the arrow B, a downward force D is generated against the surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and thus against the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thus increasing the contact pressure of the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> against the pool bottom. In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the bottom surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has no effect because it essentially slides through the water horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show a third embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown schematically. In this embodiment of the invention, the device for increasing contact pressure of the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the pool bottom is provided by a hollow bendable tube <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> suitably attached to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., with a U-bolt, not shown. In a forward direction F, the forward end of the tube <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will bend downwardly due to water resistance, as shown at <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The water will enter the tube <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to prevent buoyancy. The fluid resistance as the cleaning device is pushed through the water in the forward direction indicated by the arrow F will exert a downward pressure on the pole and the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the same device moving in the backward direction B. In this case, the proximal end of the tube <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will be forced downwardly by fluid resistance and a downward force will be generated on the tube <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which will be transferred to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and accordingly, the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thus increasing the contact pressure of the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the pool bottom. This tube may also be the vacuum hose as shown by the dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. The tube is made sufficiently flexible so that it will bend as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> show a fourth embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a perspective view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> show respectively, the orientation of the device when the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is moved in the forward direction F and in the rearward direction B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown, the device comprise a dual vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, comprising two vane members <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to each other and mounted to a common pivot <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which may comprise an axially disposed pin in a hinge member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which allows a limited degree of rotation. The hinge member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> has two stops <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>B which provide stops for the pivoting action of the dual vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in, respectively, the forward and rearward direction of movement. The hinge member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a suitable attachment means, for example a U bolt <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, in the forward direction F of the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, water pressure due to the forward movement F as indicated by D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> will cause the dual vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to pivot to the orientation shown. The vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will pivot through an angle defined by the stop member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>A. The pressure D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> due to the fluid action on the vane <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> as the pole is moved in the forward direction F will cause an increased downward pressure or torque to be exerted on the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and accordingly on the cleaning head. In the rearward direction shown by the arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the fluid force D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will act on the vane <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> causing a downward force on pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and thus provide increased pressure on the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is also not necessary to provide a stop <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>B because the vane <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> will automatically be stopped by the pole at A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Also, a slot can be provided in the vane <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> as shown at <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This will allow the vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to pivot somewhat past the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in direction B in which case the vane <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is stopped by the surface X of the slot against the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Similarly, the stop <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>A can also be removed with the vane <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> also stopping against the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Although the invention shows a hinge <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> having a limited degree of pivoting motion defined by stops <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>B, separate stop members can be provided to stop the pivoting motion of the vanes <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the hinge <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> need not have both the stop members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, the invention may also operate without a hinge <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. In such embodiment, the dual vane member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is fixed, non-pivotally attached to pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Vane member <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> provides downward force in direction F and vane members <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> provides downward force in direction B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in the various drawings, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> operates to increase the contact pressure of the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the pool bottom both in the forward and backward directions. A force being generated by the fluid pressure on the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is transferred to the pole <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and thus the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to increase the contact pressure of the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the bottom surface. Additionally, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided on the pole at a position distant from the cleaning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as not to disrupt debris and dirt to be vacuumed on the pool floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each vane may have a surface area of approximately 6 inches &times;9 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Further, although he invention has been described for use with underwater vacuum cleaning equipment, it is also applicable to other liquid pool cleaning devices, such as, e.g., scrub brushes and swabs. </paragraph>
