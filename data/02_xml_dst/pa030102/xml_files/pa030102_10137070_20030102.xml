<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a solid electrolyte battery having a battery element in which a cathode and an anode are laminated through a solid electrolyte and a method for manufacturing it, and more particularly to a solid electrolyte battery in which the generation of a short-circuit in the cathode is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, portable electronic devices such as portable telephones or thin electronic devices such as note book type personal computers have been progressively made compact and light. In these circumstances, batteries serving as driving power sources as the electronic devices have played important roles. It has been necessary for the batteries as the driving power sources to be light and efficiently utilize accommodation spaces in the devices in order to realize the compact and light electronic devices. As such batteries, solid electrolyte batteries high in their energy density and output density, more specifically, lithium-ion batteries are most preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The solid electrolyte battery has a coiling type battery element in which a cathode having a cathode composite mixture layer formed by applying a cathode composite mixture on a cathode current collector and an anode having an anode composite mixture layer formed by applying an anode composite mixture on an anode current collector are laminated through a solid electrolyte and the laminated body are coiled in the longitudinal direction, or a zigzag bending type battery element formed in such a manner that the laminated body of a cathode and an anode through a solid electrolyte are bent in a zigzag way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the cathode of the battery element provided in the solid electrolyte battery, the end part of the cathode composite mixture layer, that is, the end part at which the cathode composite mixture begins to be applied and the end part at which the application of the cathode composite mixture is finished are lager in their thickness of application of the cathode composite mixture than other parts. Thus, these end parts have large thickness and are brought into swelling states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the swelling parts at the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer undesirably greatly cause a short-circuit, so that yield is disadvantageously deteriorated upon manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, even when a separator is provided between the cathode and the anode, in case the thickness of the separator is very small as low as about 15 &mgr;m or smaller, the generation rate of the short-circuit at the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer will be inconveniently high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is proposed by considering the above-described circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide a solid electrolyte battery in which yield upon manufacturing the battery is improved and a method for manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-described object, according to the present invention, there is provided a solid electrolyte battery comprising a battery element in which a cathode having a cathode composite mixture layer formed by applying a cathode composite mixture on a cathode current collector so as to provide parts to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied at end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode current collector and an anode having an anode composite mixture layer formed by applying an anode composite mixture on an anode current collector so as to provide parts to which the anode composite mixture is not applied at end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode current collector are laminated so as to provide a solid electrolyte layer between the cathode and the anode, wherein porous members made of ceramics or non-woven fabrics are arranged between the longitudinal end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer and the longitudinal end parts of the anode composite mixture layer to extend to the parts of the cathode current collector to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the solid electrolyte battery according to the present invention constructed as described above, since the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics are arranged at the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer, the thickness of the cathode composite mixture layer is large in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer. Accordingly, even when the cathode composite mixture layer swells in the end parts thereof, the generation of a short-circuit in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, there is provided a method for manufacturing a solid electrolyte battery comprising: a step of applying a cathode composite mixture on a cathode current collector so as to provide parts to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied at end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode current collector to manufacture a cathode having a cathode composite mixture layer on the cathode current collector; a step of forming a first solid electrolyte layer on the cathode composite mixture layer; a step of manufacturing an anode having an anode composite mixture layer on an anode current collector by applying an anode composite mixture on the anode current collector so as to provide parts to which the anode composite mixture is not applied at end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode current collector; a step of forming a second solid electrolyte layer on the anode composite mixture layer; a step of arranging porous members made of ceramics or non-woven fabrics between the longitudinal end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer and the longitudinal end parts of the anode composite mixture layer so as to extend to the end parts of the cathode current collector to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied; and a step of laminating the cathode having the first solid electrolyte layer formed on the cathode composite mixture layer and the anode having the second solid electrolyte layer formed on the anode composite mixture layer so as to interpose the first solid electrolyte layer and the second solid electrolyte layer therebetween to form a battery element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the method for manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery according to the present invention constituted as described above, since the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics are disposed at the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer, the thickness of the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer is increased. Thus, even when the cathode composite mixture layer swells at the end parts in the longitudinal direction thereof, the generation of a short-circuit at the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer is prevented.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Now, a solid electrolyte battery to which the present invention is applied will be described in detail by referring to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a so-called polymer lithium-ion secondary battery. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is contained in an outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by sandwiching an aluminum foil in between polyolefine films. In the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the peripheral edge part of the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed as a heat sealing part. This heat sealing part is heat-sealed to pack the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> under vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, in the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a cathode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an anode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(referred them together as to an electrode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, hereinafter) respectively attached to the cathode and the anode of the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are drawn outside the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The above-described electrode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached to the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by, for instance, a resistance welding method, an ultrasonic welding method or the like. The battery element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pulled out from the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At that time, resin pieces are provided at parts where the electrode terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, any moisture-proof film may be employed. For example, a film formed by bonding together a nylon film, an aluminum foil and polyethylene film in regular order may be used as well as the film having the above-described structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a substantially central part of one sheet type film is bent so that the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is held inside the film, however, the film may not be limited to such a structure. For instance, the battery may be sandwiched in between two films including an upper film and a lower film or the battery element may be sealed in a film formed in a bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As an outer package material for accommodating the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, although the outer package film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of an aluminum laminate film which is preferable in view of thickness, weight and cost, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto, a prismatic or a cylindrical metallic can may be employed as the outer package material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a so-called coiling type battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in which an elongated cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an elongated anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laminated through a solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the cathode is longitudinally coiled so as to be located in an inner peripheral side. On the surfaces of the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which do not come into contact with the solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a separator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed to assuredly maintain the safety of the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed by applying a cathode composite mixture on the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, at the end parts of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, are provided parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied to collect electric current from the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. On the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a first solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for example, a metallic foil such as an aluminum foil can be used. As a cathode active material, there may be employed lithium-containing transition metal oxides. Specifically, LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiNi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Co<highlight><subscript>1-X</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(here, x satisfies a relation expressed by 0&lt;X&lt;1). Further, in the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, conventionally well-known binding agents or conductive agents may be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an anode current collector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and an anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed by applying an anode composite mixture on the anode current collector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. On the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a second solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As the anode current collector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, for instance, a metallic foil such as a copper foil can be used. As an anode active material, may be employed materials capable of doping and/or dedoping lithium. Specifically, carbon materials can be employed. Further, in the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, conventionally well-known binding agents or conductive agents may be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the structure of the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in a unitary layer by sticking the first solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the second electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed on the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, porous members made of ceramics or non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged between end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to be extended to the parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, that is, the end part at which the cathode composite mixture begins to be applied and the end part at which the application of the cathode composite mixture is finished have the thickness of application of the cathode composite mixture larger than that of other parts, so that the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer are large in their thickness and swell. Therefore, in a conventional solid electrolyte battery, a short-circuit due to the swelling in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer has been inconveniently generated so that yield upon manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery has been lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, according to the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to which the present invention is applied, since the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to extend to the parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied, even when the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has large thickness in the end parts thereof and swells in the end parts thereof, the short-circuit in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is prevented. Accordingly, in the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the generation of the short-circuit is prevented and yield upon manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Further, in the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to extend to the parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied so that a battery capacity is sufficiently exhibited to have a high capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For instance, when polypropylene tapes or the like are arranged between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to extend to the parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied, since the polypropylene tapes do not pass lithium ions therethrough, the cathode active materials covered with the polypropylene tapes cannot contribute to a battery reaction. Therefore, the theoretical capacity of the battery cannot be completely taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As compared with the polypropylene tapes, the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have the same functions as those of so-called separators by which the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is insulated from the anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, even when the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged on the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the utilization factor of the cathode active materials is not lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, when the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is overcharged so that its temperature becomes high, there is not any fear that the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be possibly deformed like the separators made of, for instance, polyethylene, polypropylene or the like. Consequently, the generation of the short-circuit can be assuredly prevented. Accordingly, the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to extend toward the parts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the cathode current collector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied, so that the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is excellent in its safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Here, assuming that the major axis of the coiling type battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is A, the width of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> parallel to the longitudinal direction of the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (refer it to as the breadth of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, hereinafter) is preferably 1/10 times as wide as A, or A or smaller. When the breadth of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is smaller than A/10, there arises a fear that the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the first solid electrolyte layer Sa cannot be completely covered with the porous members or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the breadth of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> exceeds the breadth A, the thickness of the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases and the volume of the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> itself increases, so that the energy density of the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be possibly deteriorated. Therefore, when the breadth of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is A/10 or larger and A or smaller, the short-circuit in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is assuredly prevented and the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a high capacity can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may preferably have the thickness of 0.01 mm or larger and 0.05 mm or smaller. When the thickness of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is smaller than 0.01 mm, there arises a fear that the thickness may be hardly uniform, especially, a short-circuit may be liable to be generated in thin parts. On the other hand, when the thickness of the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> exceeds 0.05 mm, the volume occupied by the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes large and the volume occupied by the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which contributes to the battery reaction decreases. Therefore, there exists a fear that a desired battery capacity cannot be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As the porous member made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, alumina may be desirably employed. </paragraph>

The thickness of the separator may preferably range from 8 &mgr;m to 15 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are insulated from each other by the solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed by bonding the first electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the second electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed on the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Therefore, although the battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> does not need, what is called, a separator between the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the anode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto and the separator may be interposed therebetween to more improve a safety. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to a method for manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constructed as mentioned above, since the porous members made of the ceramics or the non-woven fabrics <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed at the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, even when the thickness in the longitudinal end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is large and the end parts swell, the generation of short-circuit in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be prevented. Therefore, according to the method for manufacturing the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there can be manufactured the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which yield upon manufacture of the battery is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the above explanation, although the solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the coiling type battery element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is described, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto, and there may be employed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> zigzag bending type battery element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which an elongated cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an elongated anode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laminated through a solid electrolyte layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the laminated body is bent in a zigzag manner, as a battery element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A solid electrolyte battery having the zigzag bending type battery element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has the same structure as that of the above-described solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> except that the form of the battery element is different from that of the battery element of the above-described solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the same members as those of the above-described solid electrolyte battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are designated by the same reference numerals and the explanation thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>

On the other hand, when the breadth of the porous member made of the ceramics or non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is B or larger, since the thickness of the solid electrolyte battery increases and the volume of the battery element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> itself increases, there exists a fear that the energy density of the solid electrolyte battery is deteriorated. Accordingly, the breadth of each porous member made of the ceramics or each non-woven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preset to B/10 or larger and B or smaller so that the short-circuit in the end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be assuredly prevented and a solid electrolyte battery having a high capacity can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Then, the slurry cathode composite mixture was uniformly applied to both the surfaces of a cathode current collector having the thickness of 20 &mgr;m so as to provide parts to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied at end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode current collector. The applied cathode composite mixture was dried and the cathode current collector with the composite mixture thus dried was compression-molded by a roll press machine to obtain a cathode having a cathode composite mixture layer. </paragraph>

The theoretical capacity of each gel electrolyte battery is 500 mAh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Then, the battery capacity was obtained by carrying out a calculation of the 0.2 C capacity measured as described above&times;voltage/volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> After that, assuming that the number of samples is 100, the percentage of internal short-circuit was obtained on the basis of the number of the gel electrolyte batteries in which the short-circuit was generated relative to the 100 gel electrolyte batteries. As the decision standard of the internal short-circuit, each sample was stored while it was charged to 4.2 V and when the battery voltage of the sample was lowered to 4.1 V or lower after one week, the state of the sample was considered to be a short-circuit generation state. </paragraph>

Further, it is also understood that the samples 3 to 5 respectively have good 0.2 C capacity and battery capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, it is understood that an internal short-circuit is generated in the sample 1 in which the alumina separators are not disposed between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer, and accordingly, the sample 1 is not preferable in its practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Still further, it is understood that the generation of an internal short-circuit is prevented in the sample 2 in which the polypropylene tapes are arranged between the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the cathode composite mixture layer and the end parts in the longitudinal direction of the anode composite mixture layer so as to be extended to the parts of the cathode current collector to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied, however, the 0.2 C capacity and battery capacity of the sample 2 are deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the alumina separators are disposed between the longitudinal end parts of the cathode composite mixture layer and the longitudinal end parts of the anode composite mixture layer to be extended toward the parts of the cathode current collector to which the cathode composite mixture is not applied, so that the gel electrolyte battery with high capacity in which the short-circuit is not generated and the battery capacity is completely taken out can be apparently obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a plurality of gel electrolyte batteries having alumina separators with prescribed thickness and different breadth were manufactured. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Samples 6 to 9 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Each gel electrolyte battery was manufactured in the same manner as that of the sample 1 except that when a cathode was manufactured, alumina separators with breadth shown in Table 2 were arranged between end parts in the longitudinal direction of a cathode composite mixture layer and end parts in the longitudinal direction of an anode composite mixture layer to extend toward the parts of a cathode current collector to which a cathode composite mixture was not applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The charging and discharging tests as described above were similarly carried out for the samples 6 to 9 manufactured as mentioned above to measure 0.2 C capacity, a battery capacity (unit: Wh/l) and the percentage of internal short-circuit (unit: %) respectively. Assuming that the number of the samples is 100, the percentage of an internal short-circuit was obtained on the basis of the number of the gel electrolyte batteries in which the short-circuits were generated relative to the gel electrolyte batteries of 100 pieces. The theoretical capacity of each gel electrolyte battery is 500 mAh. These measured results are shown in the Table 2 as well as the thickness of batteries and so on.
