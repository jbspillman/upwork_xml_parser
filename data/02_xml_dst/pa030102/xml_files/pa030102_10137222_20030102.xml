<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to methods of forming integrated circuitry memory devices, to methods of forming dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device arrays, and to semiconductor masks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Processing of semiconductor devices typically involves many steps in which layers of material are formed over a substrate and subsequently patterned into a desired feature or structure. Typical features or structures include conductive lines and contact openings. Each time a patterning or etching step is conducted, certain risks arise which can jeopardize the integrity of a wafer being processed. For example, a mask misalignment error can cause a subsequent etch to undesirably etch into wafer or substrate structure which can cause catastrophic failure. Accordingly, a need exists to reduce the number of processing steps utilized in the formation of integrated circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention arose out of concerns associated with reducing the number of processing steps needed in the formation of integrated circuitry. This invention also arose out of concerns associated with improving the manner in which integrated circuitry memory devices, and in particular DRAM devices are fabricated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> fragmentary portion of a semiconductor wafer in process is indicated generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and includes a semiconductive substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As used in this document, the term &ldquo;semiconductive substrate&rdquo; is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material, including, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive materials such as a semiconductive wafer (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials thereon), and semiconductive material layers (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials). The term &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; refers to any supporting structure, including, but not limited to, the &ldquo;semiconductive substrates&rdquo; described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A plurality of continuous active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed relative to substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of clarity, each illustrated continuous active area has been shown to extend to outside of the boundary of substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> utilizing dashed lines. Each individual active area is designated separately as <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&Prime;, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, continuous active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&Prime;, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; are not straight or linear, but rather bend or serpentine relative to the substrate within which they are formed. The illustrated individual continuous active areas extend generally horizontally across the page upon which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> appears, and bend or jog upwardly as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A plurality of conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are formed over substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> relative to active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, four of the conductive lines are designated with numeral <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and one of the conductive lines is designated with numeral <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A pair of conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be seen on either side of conductive line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> run generally vertically as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> constitute or define an array over which a plurality of memory cells will be formed. The array, in the preferred embodiment, constitutes a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) array. Individual areas which are consumed by single memory cells in accordance with this embodiment are illustrated by dashed outline at 30. Such area can be considered or described as relative to a dimension &ldquo;F&rdquo;. In the illustrated example, &ldquo;F&rdquo; equals one-half of the &ldquo;minimum pitch&rdquo; of the memory array. The term &ldquo;minimum pitch,&rdquo; in turn, will be understood within the context of this document, to be about equal to the smallest distance of a line width (such as lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) plus the width of a space immediately adjacent the line on one side of the line between the line and a next adjacent line in a repeated pattern within the array. As shown, a single memory cell is about 3F wide by about 2F deep, thus providing a consumed area for a single memory cell of about 6F<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In a preferred implementation, &ldquo;F&rdquo; is no greater than 0.25 micron, and even more preferably, no is greater than 0.18 micron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a preferred implementation, selected individual conductive lines provide electrical isolation relative to selected adjacent memory cells. Exemplary conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serve as word lines relative to individual memory cells <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Adjacent word lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> share an intervening bit contact of adjacent pairs of memory cells as will become apparent below. Electrical isolation between the adjacent pairs of memory cells is provided by intervening conductive line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in operation, is connected with ground or a suitable negative voltage and effectively substitutes for the electrical isolation formerly provided by field oxide. A plurality of bit lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are indicated in cross-hatching in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such is a view taken along line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> at a processing point which is prior to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of isolation oxide regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed relative to substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> define, therebetween, continuous active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Individual continuous active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&Prime;, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; are indicated in their corresponding position relative to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> construction. A first insulative layer of material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the array of continuous active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The first insulative layer is also formed over conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has an upper surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is borophosphosilicate glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> masking material layer or masking substrate such as photoresist is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and patterned to form blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The patterning of the masking material layer provides a single mask which defines plurality of patterned openings which are designated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The significance of the parenthetical designation is to indicate that openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) are formed and collectively arranged to define a pattern of both bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and capacitor contact openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, both capacitor contact openings and bit line contact openings are patterned over insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in a common masking step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, openings are etched or otherwise formed in or through first insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to expose active area portions corresponding to the illustrated active areas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The exposing of the active area portions defines both capacitor contact openings and bit line contact openings for memory cells <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) which are to be formed. In accordance with one aspect, both the capacitor contact openings and the bit line contact openings are etched at the same time so that such openings are contemporaneously formed. Such openings, however, can be etched at different times. Preferably, the pattern which defines the layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> material to be etched or removed follows the corresponding continuous active areas. Blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are then stripped or otherwise removed. In one aspect, the stripping or removal of blocks <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> constitutes removing photoresist proximate the patterned bit line contact openings and capacitor contact openings in at least one common step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of conductive material is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the memory array. Preferably, layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed within both the capacitor contact openings and the illustrated bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Such material is preferably in electrical communication with the associated active area portions over which it is formed. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprises conductively doped polysilicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, material of layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is removed to a degree sufficient to isolate conductive material plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within the openings formed in and relative to first insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The removal of layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> material can be accomplished by any suitable method which is effective to isolate the illustrated plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Such can include a resist etch back, a timed etch, or planarization relative to upper surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> material is selectively removed relative to the insulative layer and to a degree sufficient to recess the conductive material to below the insulative layer upper surface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Such removal effectively forms isolated conductive material plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within the individual associated openings. Recessed conductive plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and correspond to conductive plugs which are formed relative to and within capacitor contact openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Preferably, all of such plugs of conductive material are in electrical communication with their associated substrate portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</cross-reference>, a layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of second insulative material is formed over the array and preferably over all of the previously formed conductive plugs. Accordingly, layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> material is formed over and relative to bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and capacitor contact openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Other insulative materials can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</cross-reference>, material of second insulative layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is removed from only over bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to expose the associated plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Such can be accomplished by a suitable masked etch of the second insulative layer material from over bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, material of insulative layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> remains over the plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which are disposed within the capacitor contact openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Such effectively electrically insulates the associated capacitor contact opening plugs during formation of buried bit or digit lines described just below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</cross-reference>, various layers of material from which buried bit lines are to be formed are formed over the substrate. In a preferred implementation, a layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of conductive material is formed over substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is electrically insulated from plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by second insulative material layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is conductively doped polysilicon. A silicide layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be provided over layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is WSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. A layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of insulative material can be formed over layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is an oxide material. The above constitutes but one way of forming the layers which comprise the bit lines. Other materials and layers are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 14</cross-reference>, such layers are subsequently patterned and etched to define a plurality of bit lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having conductive bit line portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, are in electrical communication with respective plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, bit lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are disposed over first insulative layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and electrically insulated from the corresponding conductive plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Such constitutes forming a plurality of conductive bit lines over the array with individual bit lines being operably associated with individual continuous active areas and in electrical communication with individual respective plugs of conductive material within the bit line contact openings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 15</cross-reference>, a layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of insulative spacer material is formed over the substrate as shown. Such material can comprise either a suitable oxide or nitride material. In one implementation, layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> comprises an oxide formed through suitable decomposition of tetraethyloxysilicate (TEOS). Such effectively electrically insulates exposed conductive portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the conductive bit lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> third insulative layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed over the array. An exemplary material for layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> material is patterned and etched over and relative to conductive plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and capacitor contact openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to expose the associated conductive plugs. Accordingly, such forms capacitor openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> within which capacitors are to formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, individual first capacitor plate structures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are formed relative to and within associated capacitor openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Such plate structures are in electrical communication with individual respective plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of dielectric material and second capacitor plate structure <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are formed relative to and operably associated with individual first capacitor plate structures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to provide individual memory cells which, in accordance with the preferred embodiment, form DRAM storage capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19, a</cross-reference> slightly enlarged view along line <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is shown. Such illustrates a view taken along one of the above-described bit lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown, bit line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be seen to overlie conductive lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and associated isolation oxide regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Bit line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also be seen to be in electrical communication with the two illustrated plugs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The above described methodology has advantages over prior processing methods. One advantage is that both the bit line contact openings and the capacitor contact openings are patterned in a common masking step. Hence, bit line contacts and capacitor contacts can be formed at the same time. Accordingly, processing steps are reduced. Additionally, extra processing steps which were formerly necessary to remove undesired conductive material left behind after bit line formation are reduced, if not eliminated. Furthermore, bit line-to-word line capacitance is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
