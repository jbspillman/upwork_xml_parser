<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A composition is prepared by extracting phytochemicals from plant matter. This composition is enriched preferably in isoflavones, lignans, saponins, catechins and phenolic acids. Soy is the preferred source of these chemicals: however, other plants may also be used, such as red clover, kudzu, flax, and cocoa. The composition is a dietary supplement for treatment of various cancers, pre- and post-menstrual syndromes, and various other disorders. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This is a formal application that replaces provisional application Serial No. 60/060,549 filed Oct. 2, 1997. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to compositions extracted from vegetable matter and more particularly to phytochemicals, including saponogenins and saponins, catechins, lignans, phenolic acids, catechins and isoflavones, and especially those extracted from a family of plants including soy, flax, tea, and cocoa and methods of using these compositions as nutritional supplements or food additives. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Plant materials are known to contain a number of classes of organic low molecular weight compounds which exert bioactivity in various animals. Historically, these compounds have been considered to be somewhat non-nutritive, however, recent scientific evidence now suggests these compounds may play an important role in the maintenance of health, in chemoprevention, and in the mitigation of certain conditions or diseases associated with the circulation of sex hormones, including sleep disorders and vaginal dryness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Edible plants normally contained in the diet, or materials used as herbal remedies/dietary supplements, may contain collections of structurally related compounds. These related substances are often unique in their amounts and distribution when compared among various plant sources. The most notable groups of compounds exhibiting bioactivity are known as flavonoids, isoflavones, saponins, lignans, alkaloids, catechins and phenolic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Epidemiology studies relating diet to disease suggest that dietary components may predispose populations to reduced risk of certain diseases. Far eastern populations consuming soy have reduced rates ok breast, prostate and colon cancers and coronary heart disease, while populations in Finland have reduced rates of prostate cancer. Researchers are just now studying the specific compounds in the diet to understand the basis for the epidemiological observations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Among the various plants consumed in the diet, several are rich sources of phytochemicals. Soy products contain high amounts of isoflavones and saponins. Unretined diet grains include plants such as wheat, psyllium, rice, flax and oats that contain lignans. Cocoa contains catechins and phenolic acids. Certain non-dietary plants are also sources of the same chemical molecules, such as lignans and isoflavones in kudzu root or red clovers. Isoflavones and lignans act as weak estrogenic substances. Tea plants are also a rich source of phytochemicals, including catechins and phenolic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Isoflavones can be used alone to treat or prevent breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and colon cancer or as mechanism inhibitors. Isoflavones alone may also reduce or prevent various symptoms related to the onset and duration of menopause, including hot flashes and osteoporosis. Isoflavones alone may also be effective in certain cardiovascular applications, including heart disease, reducing cholesterol-lipid levels, modulating angiogenesis, and other vascular effects. Moreover, isoflavones alone have been implicated in reducing headaches, dementia, inflammation, and alcohol abuse, as well as immunomodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Lignans alone have been implicated in preventing or treating breast cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer as well as reducing hot flashes, preventing osteoporosis and showing antiviral potential. Lignans also have antimitotic and fungicidal activity, plant lignan, the catecholic nordihydro-guaiaretic acid, was a potent antioxidant once used by the food industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Saponins alone have been implicated in preventing or treating skin cancer, colon cancer, reducing serum cholesterol, and in immunomodulation and antiviral activity. Saponins also exhibit antioxidant effects and act as free radical scavengers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Phenolic acids have shown antioxidant activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> People who eat a high soy diet show reduction of many of these above-discussed symptoms. This suggests that ingesting a combination of these phytochemicals in a ratio such as that found in soy may result in an additive or synergistic effect. However, a high soy diet has some undesirable effects, including flatulence, undesirable taste, and hesitancy among Western consumers to change their lifestyle to incorporate soy in their diets, even for such benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Isoflavones, which are heterocyclic phenols, are understood to include the soy compounds genistin, daidzin and glycitein, as well as biochanin A, equol, formononetin, and o-desmethylangolensin and natural derivatives thereof. These compounds and their aglycone or de-methylated aglycone forms, such as genistein and daidzein, are believed to have similar activities once they are ingested. They are sometimes referred to as phyto-estrogens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Lignans are defined to be compounds possessing a 2,3-dibenzylbutane structure. They include matairesinol, secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, isolaniciresinol, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, pinoresinol, olivil, other compounds which may be precursors of enterolactone and enterodiol and modifications thereof, including diglucosides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Phenolic acids include p-hydrobenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid. Other phenolic acids are chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, sinapic acid, syringic acid, coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, gentisic acid, salicylic acid, hydroxy benzoic acid and hydroxy phenyl acetic acids and derivatives. This list of phenolic acids should be understood to include the various isomers and derivatives found in the natural vegetable source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Catechins, or flavan-3-ols, include epigallocatechin, catechin, epicatechin and gallocatechin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Saponogenins are C-27 sterols in which the side chain has undergone metabolic changes to produce a spiroketal. Saponogenins occur naturally as saponins, which are 3-O-glycosides of the parent steroid or triterpenes. Digitonin from Digitalis is a saponin. Saponins include glucosides of sapogenin such as triterpenoids or steroids and saccharides such as glucose, arabinose, galactose or glucuronic acid. Typical examples of leguminous saponins are glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhetinic acid&plus;glucuronic acid) contained in <highlight><italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic></highlight>, soysaponin contained in soybean and alfalfasaponin contained in <highlight><italic>Medicago sativa</italic></highlight>. Saponins also include chemical entities identified as triterpene phenols such as tomatine, soyasapogenols A, B, C, D, E and F, ginsengoside fraction 3 and 4, medicagenic acid, hederagenin, glycyrrhizin digitonin, quillaja saponin, lucernic acid and zahnic acid. The natural modifications of these compounds found in the vegetable source are also included in this identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A need exists for an improved composition consisting substantially of isoflavones, lignans, saponogenins, saponins, and/or phenolic acids which will produce improved results over any of these taken alone. Furthermore, a need exists for a composition in which the beneficial phytochemicals are enriched as compared to their original source. This permits individuals to conveniently consume such phytochemicals as a nutritional supplement or as a food additive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a convenient way for individuals to consume isoflavones, lignans, saponins, catechins and/or phenolic acids, either as a nutritional supplement or as an ingredient in a more traditional type of food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An other object of this invention is to provide an optimized extract composition of phytochemicals which is in sufficient concentration to be delivered in an easy to consume dosasge such as a pill, tablet, capsule, liquid or ingredient in a food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of this invention is to prepare the phytochemical extract to be delivered as a topical application in a cream or lotion. In this form, the isoflavones, lignans, saponins, catechins and/or phenolic acids are dispersed and suspended in a suitable liquid or gel matrix to render a stable cream or lotion as the delivery vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A further object or this invention is to provide an extract concentrate which is closely similar in chemical composition to the chemical entities found in the natural plant source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In keeping with this aspect of the invention, the isoflavones, lignans, saponins, catechins and/or phenolic acids are extracted from a suitable vegetable source to render a composition which is substantially more concentrated than the original material and by more than 5 times in one or more of the desired bioactive components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This extract may be used alone or combined with one or more other plant extracts to produce the optimized composition. Further, this extract composition may be formulated with one or more other dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc., to provide a nutritional supplement further optimized for a desired health effect. All these ingredients may be combined with necessary binders, excipients, preservatives, colors and the like known to those in the industry in order to produce a suitable tablet, capsule, pill, liquid, cream, powder or food ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> These phytochemicals may be packaged and provided in final form by means known to the supplements and food ingredient industries. The materials are intended to provide health and well-being benefits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The improved composition is obtained by fractionating a plant source high in isoflavones, lignans and other phytochemicals such as defatted soybean flakes, soy molasses, soy whey, red clover, alfalfa, flax, cocoa, tea, or kudzu root. These may be fractionated along or in combination with these other plants known to be high in the various isoflavones, lignans, saponins, catechins and phenolic acids. The fractionation results in substantially removing water, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids from the source material. The fractionation method may be preferably that disclosed in co-pending U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,752 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,428,876, or an extraction using ethyl acetate or n-butanol may be used. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,752 is assigned to the assignee of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Other extraction processes, which may be used alone or in combination, include differential solubility, distillation, solvent extraction, adsorptive means, differential molecular filtration and precipitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The preferred composition is an improvement over known commercial materials regarding the amount of phytochemicals per gram of substance and the amounts of different phytochemicals present which affect physiologic function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> These natural substances have been consumed in food sources for long periods of time and more closely relate to the substances consumed which provide the basis for the epidemiological evidence for health benefits. Additional benefits may be derived from improved physical properties relative to phytochemicals chemically modified from their original food source form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The resulting composition is expected to comprise in a preferred form between 5% and 95% isoflavones, between 0% and 70% lignans, and between 2% and 70% saponins and sapogenins. In a more preferred form, the composition will be extracted from soy. In another preferred form, the composition will contain a ratio of (saponins plus saponogenins) to isoflavones from 1 100 to 100 1, with the isoflavones consisting predominantly of naturally occurring derivatives of genistein and/or its precursor biochanin A and daidzein and/or its precursor formononetin, with a ratio of the genistein derivatives to daidzein derivatives from <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to 1 100. Preferably, the isoflavones are predominantly glycosylated derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The composition&apos;s ratios may be readily varied by changing the plant source or by combining several plant sources for extraction. Thus, as further study shows which phytochemical combinations are more efficacious for certain health effects, the particular composition will also vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is known that isoflavones, lignans, and saponins can be used advantageously to treat or prevent various cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and colon cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the improved composition will provide increased benefits in the form of chemoprevention. Recent experiments appear to confirm this belief.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An initial series of animal studies was made to investigate the effects of dietary soy products on the growth of s.c. (SUBCUTANEOUS) implanted LNCaP in male SCID mice. A high isoflavone-containing soy protein isolate (SPI) (2.0 mg isoflavones/g SPI) is provided by Protein Technology International (St Louis, Mo.) A soy phytochemicals extract, soy phytochemicals concentrate (SPC) which contains 28.5% total soy isoflavones and a diverse amount of other soy phytochemicals, is provided by Archer Daniels Midland Company (Decatur, Ill.). These materials were used to prepare six experimental diets Table 1 shows ingredients of the diets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Eight-week-old male SCID mice were s.c. injected on the right flank with 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>LNCaP cells from hosts, randomized into six groups (n&equals;10) and assigned to one of the experimental diets. Food intake, body weight, and tumor volume were measured. At the termination of the experiment, blood samples were collected and serum separated for PSA analysis. An aliquot of tumor tissues was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 4 &mgr;m sections for in situ histochemical detection of apoptotic cells, and immunohistochemical analyses of angiogenesis and proliferation. Another aliquot was prepared for cell lysates for western blot to determine the expression of apoptosis-related gene products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Table 2 summaries the effects of treatment on food intake, body weight, isoflavone intake and tumor volume. Soy products did not significantly alter food intake or body weight. Compared to casein-fed controls, tumor volumes from mice treated with SPI (20%), SPC (1.0), and SPI and SPC (1.0%) were reduced by 12%, 28% (P&lt;0.04), or 40% (P&lt;0.005), respectively. Factorial analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of protein source on tumor growth. Linear regression analysis indicated that tumor volumes were inversely correlated to total dietary isoflavones (Tumor volume (cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>)&equals;&minus;0.0008&plus;2.121&times;Isoflavones (mg), R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.76, p&lt;0.03). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Table 3 shows the effects of SPC at 1.0% of the diet on apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis of tumors from a pilot study. It indicates that dietary supplementation of soy phytochemicals inhibits the growth of LNCaP tumor in vivo by enhancing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells. Its inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis is not significant which may be due to small sample size (n&equals;2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Results from in vitro study showed that genistein and soy phytochemical concentrate inhibited secretion of PSA by LNCaP cells into media PSA concentrations were reduced 68% and 70% by 25 and 50 uM of genistein treatment respectively, and 31% and 42% by 25 and 50 uM of soy phytochemical concentrate treatment respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In summary, preliminary results indicate that soy products inhibit the s.c. growth of LNCaP tumor in SCID mice, possibly via induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis and proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Isoflavones or lignans can alleviate menopausal-related symptoms such as hot flashes and osteoporosis as well as alleviate symptoms associated with menstruation. This is further believed to be due to their estrogenic activity. It is believed that the improved composition described here will alleviate these symptoms even more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Also, isoflavones positively affect various cardiovascular-related conditions, including heart disease, cholesterol (saponins also positively affect cholesterol), angiogenesis and other vascular effects. It is believed that the improved composition will produce results for these cardiovascular conditions at least as beneficial as those hitherto known and at a reduced cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As explained earlier, isoflavones, lignans, and saponins are known to individually positively affect various neurological and immunological symptoms. It is believed that the improved composition will result in alleviating neurological and immunological symptoms at least as well as those compounds hitherto known and at a reduced cost. Moreover, it would be expected that some synergism would arise out of the combination described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The improved composition may be administered orally, parenterally, for instance, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, by intranasal instillation or by application of an aerosol spray to mucous membranes, or to the skin by an ointment or a cream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Administering the improved composition may be done with any suitable carrier, in solid or liquid dosage form such as tablets, capsules, powders, soft gels, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, ointments, or creams. The improved composition may also be administered as a food supplement or as a food ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The amount of the improved composition administered will vary depending on the person, the mode of administration, and the desired result. An effective amount is expected to be 10 mg to 2000 mg/per dose. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The composition provided for in this patent may be used to prepare tablets or other dosage forms. An example of a capsule preparation is provided in Example 2. The hither the concentration of the active component, the easier it is to form a tablet or emulsion. This leads to an added ability to incorporate other dietary nutrients. An example would be to prepare a phytochemical tablet which incorporates calcium and vitamin E as a supplement to maintain bone health and/or reduce post menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In an example of this embodiment, a 600 mg dry compression tablet was prepared containing a total of 125 mg of isoflavones concentrate (50 mg isoflavone compound). Included in the tablet formulation was a source of calcium and magnesium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Dry compression tablets were produced by first blending the following ingredients: 4 kg of the improved composition (39.83% isoflavones), 1.91 kg sorbitol, 0.095 kg magnesium stearate, and 13.11 kg dicalcium phosphate in a 120 quart capacity Hobart mixer. This blend of ingredients was then dry compressed at 1 ton pressure with a Stokes BB2 simple press into tablets having a total weight of 600 mg containing 125.53 mg of the improved composition and therefore 50 mg of total isoflavones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a photochemical concentrate may be provided in a single dosage form, a skin cream or as a food ingredient added to conventional food in amounts from 10 mg to 2000 mg/per dose, the purpose of which is to exert a positive effect on health and well being. These benefits include: cancer prevention, estrogen and sex hormone related maladies, inhibition of the pituitary-thyroid-gonadotrophic axis, alcohol dependency reduction, modulation of the cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems, antiviral effects and analgesic effects. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Two-piece gelatin capsules were produced by filling the receiving end of the empty size &ldquo;0&rdquo; capsules with 0.106 g of the improved composition (44.35% isoflavones) and closed with the capping end, providing a capsule containing 47.2 mg of total isoflavones. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A comparison between various sources of phytochemical preparations is given in Table 4. It is readily seen that the phytochemical components of the composition of the &ldquo;Isoflavone Concentrate&rdquo; of this invention is substantially higher than the corresponding amounts in the natural vegetable materials. Notably, the amount of glycone isoflavones and saponins are over 100 times more concentrated compared to the food source and over twenty times more concentrated compared to the germ of the plant which naturally concentrates these phytochemicals. Comparison of the &ldquo;Isoflavone Concentrate&rdquo; of this invention to other concentrates shows that the isoflavone fraction predominates in these latter products, reducing the amount of other healthful phytochemicals. Additionally, the extraction methods of these other products employ techniques which modify the components, particularly the isoflavones, so that they are not identical to the substances found in the natural vegetable material (U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,562). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> One version of the improved composition was compared to other previously described compositions. The results are shown in Table 4.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The glycoside forms, genistin and daidzin, are at least 4.57 and 13.32 fold higher in concentration at 37&deg; C. than their corresponding aglycone forms, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The modifications made to the isoflavones are to remove the carbohydrate attached to the isoflavone moiety. This modification renders the isoflavone less soluble in water. Maintenance of the natural modification, glycosylation, enhances solubility. This fact is shown in the comparative solubility chart of Table 5. This chart shows that the genistin isoflavone is 4.6 times higher and the daidzin isoflavone is 13.3 times higher than the corresponding non-glycosylated form. Higher solubility can lead to better bioavailability to intestinal organisms. The glycosylation does not inhibit absorption in the gut because the intestinal microflora convert the glycone form to the aglycone form before absorption occurs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Extraction of Lignans from Flax </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Lignans can be readily extracted from flax using this following method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 978 g of defatted flax meal (F1) was extracted with 2000 g of 85% ethanol at 40&deg; C. for 10 minutes, forming a slurry. The resulting slurry was filtered and extraction was repeated twice with a total of 6000 g of ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The ethanolic fraction was then evaporated under vacuum at 70&deg; C., resulting in an aqueous fraction of 1186 g. The aqueous fraction was combined with 1000 g of water and mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The mixed sample was then ultra-filtered through a 5000 molecular weight cutoff membrane, resulting in a 767 g permeate fraction and a retentate action of 1283 g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The retentate fraction %vas freeze-dried, resulting in a 27.84 g sample (F2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The 767 g permeate fraction at 50&deg; C. was fed to a 35 ml bed volume, XAD-4 resin column at a rate of 10 ml/min. The column effluent was collected and dried, resulting in a 14.8 g sample (F3). XAD-4 is a trademark for an absorbent resin, available from Rohm &amp; Haas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The column was then eluted with four bed volumes (140 ml) of 70% ethanol at 50&deg; C. The eluent sample was evaporated under vacuum at 70&deg; C. and dried, resulting in a 1.79 g sample (F4). The four fractions were then analyzed for their lignan content, measured as the concentration by weight of secoisolariciresinol. As Table 6 shows, this extraction method enriches lignan concentration.
