<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to sealing or gasketing and, more particularly, to systems and methods for sealing an interior compartment of a vehicle against entry of water, wind, noise, dust, or other environmental contamination. The system and method of the invention are particularly adapted for use in an automobile and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, it will be appreciated that the invention has broader applications and may be used to provide a water-tight seal in many different environments, such as other types of overland vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, washing machines, automatic dishwashers, and so forth. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The metal inner panel of a vehicle door has a plurality of openings and holes therein for mounting certain accessories and mechanisms in the door and for providing access to such accessories and mechanisms. By way of example, the inner panel of a vehicle door may have openings and holes for mounting such items as window operating mechanisms, locks and lock switches, side-view mirror controllers, loudspeakers, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A decorative interior trim panel and arm rest are conventionally applied over the inner panel of a vehicle door. Commonly, a water deflector or shield is applied between the inner door panel and interior door trim for preventing entry of water, dirt, and the like into the vehicle body or causing damage to the interior door trim itself. Heretofore, the normal practice has been to secure a water deflector over the inner door panel prior to installing the trim panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as recognized by the present invention, there exists a need in the art for a combined trim panel and water deflector or shield which permits the water deflector to be installed simultaneously with the trim panel. As further recognized by the present invention, there exists a need in the art for a door trim sealing system which obviates the need for a separate water deflector or shield. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, a combined trim panel and water shield includes a water shield having opposite first and second surfaces, and which is of a size and shape to generally conform to a door panel and a trim panel to be protected. The trim panel is configured to cover a vehicle door panel and has a first surface configured to face an interior compartment of the vehicle and a second surface opposite the first surface. A first sealing layer, applied in a predetermined pattern, engages the first surface of the water shield and the second surface of the trim panel.

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, a method for the production of a combined water shield and trim panel structure is provided. The method comprises providing a trim panel which is configured to cover a door panel, and which has a first surface configured to face an interior compartment of a vehicle. A sealing member, which may be a flat or shaped sheet of material having opposite first and second surfaces is also provided. The sealing member is of a size and shape to generally conform to the trim panel and the door panel. A first sealing material is applied to the first surface of the sheet in a first predetermined pattern, and a second sealing material is applied to the second surface of the sheet in a second predetermined pattern. The sheet and the trim panel are aligned so that the first surface of the sheet is in facing relation with a second surface of the trim panel opposite the first surface thereof. The trim panel is contacted with the first sealing member to attach the trim panel to the water shield. In a more limited aspect, a protective liner of plastic or other material is removably attached to the second sealing layer and is removed when the combined water shield/trim panel is installed on the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, a sealing system for application to a vehicle interior trim panel for preventing the entry of water or dust from entering an interior compartment of the vehicle includes a trim panel configured for covering a vehicle door panel, the trim panel having a first surface configured to face an interior compartment of the vehicle and a second surface opposite the first surface. The sealing system further includes at least one compressible sealing member engaging the trim panel and providing a sealing interference between the vehicle door panel and the trim panel when the trim panel is installed on the door panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect, a method for sealing a vehicle door interior trim panel against entry of water or dust includes attaching at least one compressible sealing member to a trim panel such that the at least one sealing member is positioned to provide a sealing interference between the door panel and the trim panel when the trim panel is installed on the door panel. The trim panel retaining the at least one compressible sealing member is then installed onto the door panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a fifth aspect, a combined trim panel and water shield assembly for a vehicle includes a trim panel configured for covering a vehicle door panel, the trim panel in facing relation to an interior compartment of the vehicle. A foam layer engages and is sandwiched between the trim panel layer and the door panel. Optionally, a sealing layer for providing a seal between the flat sheet and the inner door panel, such as an adhesive or a compressible seal, is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a sixth aspect, a stacked plurality of sealing systems is provided. The stacked plurality includes a first sealing system including a trim panel adapted to cover a vehicle door panel and a sealing member engaging the trim panel and providing a sealing interference between the vehicle door panel and the trim panel. The stacked plurality also includes a second sealing system positioned adjacent the first sealing system. The second sealing system includes a trim panel adapted to cover a vehicle door panel and a sealing member engaging the trim panel. The stacked plurality of sealing systems further comprises a releasable protective liner disposed between the first and second sealing systems. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a permanent pressure-sensitive adhesive and the layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a compression-type seal. This embodiment provides the advantage of allowing easy removal and replacement for door access and repair. In another preferred embodiment, the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a first adhesive, such as a non-permanent or removable pressure-sensitive adhesive, and layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprises a second adhesive having a greater tenacity or tack than the first adhesive, which may be, for example, a nonpermanent adhesive having a higher tack or tenacity than the first or a substantially permanent adhesive. Both of these embodiments allow the trim panel and water shield to be applied as a single unit, thus eliminating the need for separate water shield application during assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In construction, one or both of the first and second sealing layers, if present, are applied to the respective side of the water shield substrate, each in a preselected pattern corresponding to a desired configuration, and serve as means of attachment to aligned or mating surfaces of the trim panel layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner door panel sheet metal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The water shields can be attached to the trim panel at a central location and the combined article <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> then applied to the door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a single unit at the assembly plant.

The protective liner is a polyethylene or other plastic sheet, preferably release coated with a release agent, such as a silicone-based release material. The protective sheet is then removed prior to installation at the assembly plant. The trim panel shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serves as a protection for the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> if present. If the water deflectors are not preattached to the trim panel, the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be lined with a protective sheet in like manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the units can be stacked into pads, with protective liners removably placed over the adhesive or sealing layers as necessary to separate adjacent units. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the water shields <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with oppositely disposed first and second sealing layers are removably sandwiched between protective liners <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to form a stack or pad of a desired number of water deflectors for processing, shipping, handling, and storage until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F, there is shown an exploded view of a vehicle door <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> employing a sealing system formed in accordance with a second aspect of the subject invention in which a door panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sealed with a substrate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which uses sealing elements <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> formed on the door and trim panel parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The door <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generally comprises an outer panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an inner panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> suitably secured to the outer panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such as by welding along the peripheral edge of panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the panels defining an internal chamber for accommodating various internal door mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is installed over the inner panel to form the interior surface of the door <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to overlie the various door-mounted components. The trim panel is attached to the inner door panel using clips, screws, snap-type fasteners, and the like, in a known manner. A water shield <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which may be a flat or shaped sheet of material, is located between the door panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the trim panel layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Various openings, e.g., openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, may be provided in the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for loudspeaker, wire, door handle, lock rod, and other attachment and pass-through points. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A, a first sealing material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which may be an adhesive or a compression-type gasket material, is disposed between the deflector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A second sealing layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which is also an adhesive or a compression-type gasket material, and which may be the same as or different than the layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located between the panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The compression seal or adhesive layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are applied in a predetermined pattern which is in aligned relationship with respect to certain design features or sealing elements of the inner door panel and the trim panel when the trim panel and door panel are placed in facing relation. In the illustrated embodiment, inner panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a flat region <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> generally following the peripheral edge thereof. In this manner, the inner door panel can be formed with a functionally needed shape as determined by the particular door configuration and which can be generally uneven so long as at least track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is generally flat for sealingly engaging the sealing system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the sealing system includes a flexible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, e.g., a flexible plastic film, having a first sealing layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> facing the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a second sealing layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> disposed on the opposite side of the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and facing the track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the door panel. The trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a raised pressure rib <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> molded thereinto for retaining and further compressing the sealing member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the sealing system includes a compressible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;, e.g., a compressible foam material. The substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; is disposed between the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the door panel. The trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a raised pressure rib <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> molded thereinto for retaining and further compressing the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the sealing system includes a compressible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; engaging trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which includes a raised pressure rib <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> molded thereinto for retaining and further compressing the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;. A sealing layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, such as an adhesive or compression-type seal, engages the opposite side of the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; and the track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the inner door panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, the sealing system includes a compressible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; having a first sealing layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> facing the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a second sealing layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> disposed on the opposite side of the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; and facing the track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the door panel. The trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a raised pressure rib <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> molded thereinto for retaining and further compressing the sealing member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>E, the sealing system includes a compressible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; having a sealing layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> facing the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a raised pressure rib <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> formed in the trim panel surface retaining and further compressing the sealing member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The opposite surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; sealingly engages the track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the door panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, the sealing system includes a rigid, non-compressible substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&Prime; facing the trim panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a sealing member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> engaging the raised portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the door panel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In each of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F, the trim panel and the appropriate sealing elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&Prime;, and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be assembled at a centralized location to provide a combined trim panel and water shield to be installed as a single unit onto the door at the assembly plant. In a preferred embodiment, clips or other mechanical fasteners which are used fasten the trim panel to the door panel also fasten the sealing members to the trim panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Of course, in each of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>F, the track region <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be omitted where the door panel itself otherwise provides an adequate sealing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Although a door and sealing system of given configuration are illustrated in the depicted exemplary embodiment, the present invention is not limited to any particular configuration. It will be recognized that other geometric shapes, patterns, and spatial orientations can be used to accommodate different applications or installations without in any way departing from the overall intent or scope of the invention. Likewise, continuous gaskets or beads of material need not be used, and the seals may instead comprise one or more discontinuous strips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When a compression-type seal is used as a sealing member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the cross-sectional shape of the gasket can be modified to accommodate the particular surface to be sealed. Likewise, the resiliency of the gasket material can be selected to obtain a desired degree of sealing force. Instead of a generally solid gasket as shown in the illustrated embodiment, a hollow or tubular compression seal, e.g., having a flexible sealing portion and compressible walls, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A fragmentary cross-sectional view of a combined trim panel/water deflector system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> formed in accordance with another embodiment of the development is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The combined trim panel and water deflector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a trim panel layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the outward surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of which faces an interior compartment of a vehicle and is peripherally shaped to substantially cover an inner door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is preferably an open-cell foam material, most preferably a polyurethane foam material, and provides a sound-absorbing function to reduce wind noise and other noise from entering the interior compartment of the vehicle. Since the water deflector <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is attached directly to the trim panel, fewer holes in the part are required, thus improving air, dust, and sound sealing than conventional water deflectors. The foam material is adhesively bonded to the substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is advantageously compression cut to provide a nonplaniform surface which is complimentary to and mating with the inward surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the foam layer is thus varied so as to provide a surface which matches the inward surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, i.e., the foam surface has raised areas which engage complimentary recesses or depressions in the trim panel and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The variable thickness in the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be formed using a compression cutting technique. In this manner, the foam thickness can be varied in any configuration from full thickness down to near zero. The sheet is compressed between a smooth roller and a profiled roller or plate to selectively compress the foam different amounts in different regions. A cutting blade is positioned to cut the foam just as it exits the nip. In this manner, the regions that are compressed are not cut or are minimally cut and the uncompressed areas are cut more deeply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> engages substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and inner door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the sealing layer is a pressure sensitive adhesive, preferably forming a continuous ribbon or bead about the periphery of the combined trim panel and water shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The use of discontinuous bands is also contemplated, and the sealing material <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be provided to additional areas within the peripheral bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprises a compression-type seal or gasket, preferably forming a continuous seal about the periphery of the combined trim panel and water shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The use of discontinuous sealing portions is also contemplated, however. The sealing material <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be provided to additional areas within the periphery of the area to be sealed. Preferably, the gasket is a formed-in-place (FIP) type of gasket, such as polyurethane foam or other material which is dispensed as a bead of material in its uncured state and then allowed to cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of the material comprising the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the trim panel is fastened to the inner door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using mechanical fasteners, such as conventional trim panel clips or the like (not shown). The thickness of the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is such that it will be compressed when the combined unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is installed on the door, the compression providing a sufficient degree of pressurization to effect a seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Although the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be formed in situ at the assembly plant, it is preferable to apply the layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a centralized location. When the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is preapplied, it is preferable to removably attach a protective sheet of material. When sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is a pressure sensitive adhesive, including both nonpermanent and substantially permanent pressure sensitive type adhesives, a release coated sheet of plastic material can advantageously be employed as the protective sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Since the mechanical attachments found on the trim panel portion are used to locate the sealing system, operator sensitivity and variation in part installation is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a first adhesive is used between the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and a second adhesive having a higher tack or tenacity than the first is used between the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and trim panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are thus easily removable from the substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, e.g., for servicing, replacement, and so forth. When an adhesive is used as the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the tack or tenacity of the adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is likewise higher than the first adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, an adhesive is used as the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which has a lower tack or tenacity than the adhesive bonding the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the trim panel shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as well as the adhesive bonding the foam layer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the combined trim panel and water shield <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is removable as a single unit for servicing, repair, or replacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is illustrated an embodiment substantially as described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, but wherein the sealing layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is eliminated. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the compression of the foam material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that results when the unit is installed on the door effects a sealing engagement between sheet metal layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and substrate layer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, there are shown embodiments which are as described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, respectively, except that the substrate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of this specification. The forms hereinbefore described are merely explanatory and exemplary and it is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations. </paragraph>
