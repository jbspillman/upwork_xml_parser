<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane domain proteins that mediate signal transduction of a diverse number of ligands through heterotrimeric G proteins (Strader, C. D. et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>63: 101-132). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), along with G-proteins and effector proteins (e.g., intracellular enzymes and channels), are the components of a modular signaling system. Upon ligand binding to an extracellular portion of a GPCR, different G proteins are activated, which in turn modulate the activity of different intracellular effector enzymes and ion channels (Gutkind, J. S. (1998) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>273: 1839-1842; Selbie, L. A. and Hill, S. J. (1998) <highlight><italic>Trends Pharmacol. Sci. </italic></highlight>19:87-93). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> G proteins represent a family of heterotrimeric proteins composed of &agr;, &bgr; and &ggr; subunits, which bind guanine nucleotides. These proteins are usually linked to cell surface receptors (e.g., GPCR). Following ligand binding to the GPCR, a conformational change is transmitted to the G protein, which causes the &agr;-subunit to exchange a bound GDP molecule for a GTP molecule and to dissociate from the &bgr;&ggr;-subunits. The GTP-bound form of the &agr;-subunit typically functions as an effector-modulating moiety, leading to the production of second messengers, such as cyclic AMP (e.g., by activation of adenylate cyclase), diacylglycerol or inositol phosphates. Greater than 20 different types of &agr;-subunits are known in man, which associate with a smaller pool of &bgr; and &ggr; subunits. Examples of mammalian G proteins include Gi, Go, Gq, Gs and Gt (Lodish H. et al. Molecular Cell Biology, (Scientific American Books Inc., New York, N.Y., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The GPCR protein superfamily identified to date includes over 250 subtypes. The superfamily can be broken down into five subfamilies: Subfamily I, which includes receptors typified by rhodopsin and the beta2-adrenergic receptor and currently contains over 200 unique members (reviewed by Dohlman et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>60:653-688); Subfamily II, which includes the parathyroid hormone/calcitonin/secretin receptor family (Juppner et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>254:1024-1026; Lin et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>254:1022-1024); Subfamily III, which includes the metabotropic glutamate receptor family in mammals, such as the GABA receptors (Nakanishi et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>258: 597-603); Subfamily IV, which includes the cAMP receptor family that is known to mediate the chemotaxis and development of <highlight><italic>D. discoideum </italic></highlight>(Klein et al.(1988) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>241:1467-1472); and Subfamily V, which includes the fungal mating pheromone receptors such as STE2 (reviewed by Kurjan I et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>61:1097-1129). Within each family, distinct, highly conserved motifs have been identified. These motifs have been suggested to be critical for the structural integrity of the receptor, as well as for coupling to G proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> GPCRs are of critical importance to several systems including the endocrine system, the central nervous system and peripheral physiological processes. The GPCR genes and gene-products are also believed to be causative agents of disease (Spiegel et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest. </italic></highlight>92:1119-1125); McKusick and Amberger (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Med. Genet. </italic></highlight>30:1-26). Given the important biological roles and properties of GPCRs, there exists a need for the identification of novel genes encoding such proteins as well as for the discovery of modulators of such molecules for use in regulating a variety of normal and/or pathological cellular processes. </paragraph>

This deposit was made merely as a convenience for those of skill in the art and is not an admission that a deposit is required under 35 U.S.C. &sect;112. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The 44576 receptor contains a significant number of structural characteristics in common with members of the G-protein coupled receptor family. The term &ldquo;family&rdquo; when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the invention means two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin, or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;G protein-coupled receptor&rdquo; or &ldquo;GPCR&rdquo; refers to a family of proteins that preferably comprise an N-terminal extracellular domain, seven transmembrane domains (also referred to as membrane-spanning domains), three extracellular domains (also referred to as extracellular loops), three cytoplasmic domains (also referred to as cytoplasmic loops), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (also referred to as a cytoplasmic tail). Members of the GPCR family also share certain conserved amino acid residues, some of which have been determined to be critical to receptor function and/or G protein signaling. An alignment of the transmembrane domains of 44 representative GPCRs can be found at http://mgdkk1.nid11.nih.gov:8000/extended.html. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Based on a BLAST search, the 44576 receptors of the invention show significant homology to a human seven transmembrane orphan receptor having Accession No. AB037108, and a murine seven transmembrane orphan receptor having Accession No. AF05198. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a 44576 protein includes at least one extracellular domain. When located at the N-terminal domain the extracellular domain is referred to herein as an &ldquo;N-terminal extracellular domain&rdquo;, or as an N-terminal extracellular loop in the amino acid sequence of the protein. As used herein, an &ldquo;N-terminal extracellular domain&rdquo; includes an amino acid sequence having about 1-100, preferably about 1-70, more preferably about 1-60, more preferably about 1-50, even more preferably about 1-45 amino acid residues in length and is located outside of a cell or extracellularly. The C-terminal amino acid residue of a &ldquo;N-terminal extracellular domain&rdquo; is adjacent to an N-terminal amino acid residue of a transmembrane domain in a naturally-occurring 4576 or 4576-like protein. For example, an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is located at about amino acid residues 1-45 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment 44576 polypeptide or protein has an &ldquo;N-terminal extracellular domain&rdquo; or a region which includes at least about 1-100 more preferably about 1-50 or 1-45 amino acid residues and has at least about 60%, 70% 80% 90% 95%, 99%, or 100% homology with an &ldquo;N-terminal extracellular domain,&rdquo; e.g., the N-terminal extracellular domain of human 44576 (e.g., residues 145 of SEQ ID NO:2). Preferably, the N-terminal extracellular domain is capable of interacting (e.g., binding to) with an extracellular signal, for example, a ligand or a cell surface receptor. Most preferably, the N-terminal extracellular domain mediates protein-protein interactions, signal transduction and/or cell adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a 44576 protein includes at least one, two, three, four, five, six, or preferably, seven transmembrane domains. As used herein, the term &ldquo;transmembrane domain&rdquo; includes an amino acid sequence of about 15 amino acid residues in length which spans the plasma membrane. More preferably, a transmembrane domain includes about at least 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 amino acid residues and spans the plasma membrane. Transmembrane domains are rich in hydrophobic residues, and typically have an a-helical structure. In a preferred embodiment, at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more of the amino acids of a transmembrane domain are hydrophobic, e.g., leucines, isoleucines, tyrosines, or tryptophans. Transmembrane domains are described in, for example, htto://pfam.wust1.edu/cgi-bin/getdesc&quest;name&equals;7tm-1, and Zagotta W. N. et al, (1996) <highlight><italic>Annual Rev.

The 44576 molecules can additionally include at least one, two, three, four and preferably five N-myristoylation sites; and at least one, two and preferably three N-glycosylation sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the 44576 polypeptides of the invention may modulate 44576-mediated activities, they may be useful as of for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents for 44576-mediated or related disorders, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;44576 activity&rdquo;, &ldquo;biological activity of 44576&rdquo; or &ldquo;functional activity of 44576&rdquo;, refers to an activity exerted by a 44576 protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on e.g., a 44576-responsive cell or on a 44576 substrate, e.g., a protein substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro. In one embodiment, a 44576 activity is a direct activity, such as an association with a 44576 target molecule. A &ldquo;target molecule&rdquo; or &ldquo;binding partner&rdquo; is a molecule with which a 44576 protein binds or interacts in nature. In an exemplary embodiment, is a 44576 receptor. A 44576 activity can also be an indirect activity, e.g., a cellular signaling activity mediated by interaction of the 44576 protein with a 44576 receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The 44576 molecules of the present invention are predicted to have similar biological activities as G-protein coupled receptor family members. For example, the 44576 proteins of the present invention can have one or more of the following activities: (1) regulating, sensing and/or transmitting an extracellular signal into a cell, for example, a bone cell (e.g., an osteoclast or an osteoblast), a hematopoietic cell, a neural cell, a heart cell); (2) interacting with (e.g., binding to) an extracellular signal or a cell surface receptor; (3) mobilizing an intracellular molecule that participates in a signal transduction pathway (e.g., adenylate cyclase or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)); (4) regulating polarization of the plasma membrane; (5) controlling production or secretion of molecules; (6) altering the structure of a cellular component; (7) modulating cell proliferation, e.g., synthesis of DNA; and (8) modulating cell migration, cell differentiation; and cell survival. Thus, the 44576 molecules can act as novel diagnostic targets and therapeutic agents for controlling G-protein coupled receptor-related disorders. Other activities, as described below, include the ability to modulate function, survival, morphology, proliferation and/or differentiation of cells of tissues in which 44576 molecules are expressed (e.g, bone cells, hematopoietic cells, brain cells, trachea, skeletal muscle, skin, testis, breast, ovary, placenta and heart). For example, the activities of 44576 can include modulation of (9) bone metabolism, e.g., bone formation and/or degeneration; (10) hematopoiesis; (11) neural development and maintenance; (12) cardiovascular activities (13) endocrine function, e.g., thyroid function; (14) skeletal muscle function; (15) tracheal function; (16) connective tissue function, e.g., skin-related activities; and/or (16) reproductive function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The response mediated by a 44576 receptor protein depends on the type of cell. For example, in some cells, binding of a ligand to the receptor protein may stimulate an activity such as release of compounds, gating of a channel, cellular adhesion, migration, differentiation, etc., through phosphatidylinositol or cyclic AMP metabolism and turnover while in other cells, the binding of the ligand will produce a different result Regardless of the cellular activity/response modulated by the receptor protein, it is universal that the protein is a GPCR and interacts with G proteins to produce one or more secondary signals, in a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways, e.g., through phosphatidylinositol or cyclic AMP metabolism and turnover, in a cell. As used herein, a &ldquo;signaling transduction pathway&rdquo; refers to the modulation (e.g., stimulation or inhibition) of a cellular function/activity upon the binding of a ligand to the GPCR (44576 protein). Examples of such functions include mobilization of intracellular molecules that participate in a signal transduction pathway, e.g., phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and adenylate cyclase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;phosphatidylinositol turnover and metabolism&rdquo; refers to the molecules involved in the turnover and metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) as well as to the activities of these molecules. PIP<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is a phospholipid found in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Binding of ligand to the receptor activates, in some cells, the plasma-membrane enzyme phospholipase C that in turn can hydrolyze PIP<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to produce 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Once formed IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can diffuse to the endoplasmic reticulum surface where it can bind an IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>receptor, e.g., a calcium channel protein containing an IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>binding site. IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>binding can induce opening of the channel, allowing calcium ions to be released into the cytoplasm. IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (IP<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), a molecule which can cause calcium entry into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium. IP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and IP<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>can subsequently be hydrolyzed very rapidly to the inactive products inositol 1,4-biphosphate (IP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate, respectively. These inactive products can be recycled by the cell to synthesize PIP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The other second messenger produced by the hydrolysis of PIP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, namely 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), remains in the cell membrane where it can serve to activate the enzyme protein kinase C. Protein kinase C is usually found soluble in the cytoplasm of the cell, but upon an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, this enzyme can move to the plasma membrane where it can be activated by DAG. The activation of protein kinase C in different cells results in various cellular responses such as the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, or the phosphorylation of various transcription factors, e.g., NF-kB. The language &ldquo;phosphatidylinositol activity&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to an activity of PIP<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or one of its metabolites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Another signaling pathway in which the receptor may participate is the cAMP turnover pathway. As used herein, &ldquo;cyclic AMP turnover and metabolism&rdquo; refers to the molecules involved in the turnover and metabolism of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as well as to the activities of these molecules. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger produced in response to ligand-induced stimulation of certain G protein coupled receptors. In the cAMP signaling pathway, binding of a ligand to a GPCR can lead to the activation of the enzyme adenyl cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP. The newly synthesized cAMP can in turn activate a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This activated kinase can phosphorylate a voltage-gated potassium channel protein, or an associated protein, and lead to the inability of the potassium channel to open during an action potential. The inability of the potassium channel to open results in a decrease in the outward flow of potassium, which normally repolarizes the membrane of a neuron, leading to prolonged membrane depolarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The 44576 mRNA is expressed in decreasing order in bone cells (primarily, osteoclasts and, to a lower extent, in osteoblasts), hematopoietic cells (e.g., CD71-expressing bone marrow cells, fetal liver cells, erythroid cells), brain cells, trachea, skeletal muscle, skin, testis, breast, ovary, placenta and heart (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), it is likely that 44576 molecules of the present invention may be involved in disorders characterized by aberrant activity of these cells. Thus, the 44576 molecules can act as novel diagnostic targets and therapeutic agents for controlling disorders involving aberrant activities of these cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For example, aberrant expression and/or activity of 44576 molecules may mediate disorders associated with bone metabolism. &ldquo;Bone metabolism&rdquo; refers to direct or indirect effects in the formation or degeneration of bone structures, e.g., bone formation, bone resorption, etc., which may ultimately affect the concentrations in serum of calcium and phosphate. This term also includes activities mediated by 44576 molecules effects in bone cells, e.g. osteoclasts and osteoblasts, that may in turn result in bone formation and degeneration. For example, 44576 molecules may support different activities of bone resorbing osteoclasts such as the stimulation of differentiation of monocytes and mononuclear phagocytes into osteoclasts. Accordingly, 44576 molecules that modulate the production of bone cells can influence bone formation and degeneration, and thus may be used to treat bone disorders. Examples of such disorders include, but are not limited to, osteoporosis, osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, rickets, osteitis fibrosa cystica, renal osteodystrophy, osteosclerosis, anti-convulsant treatment, osteopenia, fibrogenesis-imperfecta ossium, secondary hyperparathyrodism, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, drug induced metabolism, medullary carcinoma, chronic renal disease, rickets, sarcoidosis, glucocorticoid antagonism, malabsorption syndrome, steatorrhea, tropical sprue, idiopathic hypercalcemia and milk fever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As the 44576 mRNA is expressed in the hematopoietic cells, e.g., bone marrow CD71-expressing cells (e.g., erythroid cells and dendritic cells), fetal liver, the 44576 nucleic acid and protein of the invention can be used to treat and/or diagnose a variety of immune disorders. Exemplary immune disorders include hematopoietic neoplastic disorders. As used herein, the term &ldquo;hematopoietic neoplastic disorders&rdquo; includes diseases involving hyperplastic/neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. Preferably, the diseases arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias, e.g., erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Additional exemplary myeloid disorders include, but are not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus, L.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Low levels of expression of the 44576 mRNA were detected in skeletal muscle, thyroid, skin, testis, breast, ovary, placenta and heart. Thus, the 44576 molecules may act as novel diagnostic targets and therapeutic agents for controlling disorders involving aberrant activities of these cells. Examples of skeletal muscle disorders include (e.g., Marfan syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta). Examples of endocrine disorders, e.g., thyroid disorders, include, but are not limited to, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, dwarfism, giantism, and acromegaly. </paragraph>

Nucleic acid molecules encoding such polypeptides or proteins are collectively referred to as &ldquo;nucleic acids of the invention&rdquo; or &ldquo;44576 nucleic acids.&rdquo; 44576 molecules refer to 44576 nucleic acids, polypeptides, and antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;nucleic acid molecule&rdquo; includes DNA molecules (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., an mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated, e.g., by the use of nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. </paragraph>

For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5&prime; and/or 3&prime; ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of 5&prime; and/or 3&prime; nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridizes under stringent conditions&rdquo; describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. A preferred, example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6&times; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&deg; C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50&deg; C. Another example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6&times; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&deg; C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55&deg; C.

For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the polypeptides of the present invention, e.g., those present in the transmembrane domains, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;conservative amino acid substitution&rdquo; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a 44576 protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a 44576 coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for 44576 biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3, or the nucleotide sequence of the DNA insert of the plasmid deposited with ATCC as Accession Number ______, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;biologically active portion&rdquo; of a 44576 protein includes a fragment of a 44576 protein which participates in an interaction between a 44576 molecule and a non-44576 molecule. Biologically active portions of a 44576 protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the 44576 protein, e.g., the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, which include less amino acids than the full length 44576 proteins, and exhibit at least one activity of a 44576 protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the 44576 protein, e.g., a domain or motif capable of regulating, sensing and/or transmitting an extracellular signal into a cell, for example, a bone cell (e.g., an osteoclast or an osteoblast), a hematopoietic cell, a neural cell, a heart cell); a domain or motif capable of interacting with (e.g., binding to) an extracellular signal or a cell surface receptor, a domain or motif capable of mobilizing an intracellular molecule that participates in a signal transduction pathway (e.g., adenylate cyclase or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)); a domain or motif capable of regulating polarization of the plasma membrane; a domain or motif capable of controlling production or secretion of molecules; a domain or motif capable of altering the structure of a cellular component; a domain or motif capable of modulating cell proliferation, e.g., synthesis of DNA; and/or a domain or motif capable of modulating cell migration, cell differentiation; and/or cell survival. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A biologically active portion of a 44576 protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or more amino acids in length. Biologically active portions of a 44576 protein can be used as targets for developing agents which modulate a 44576 mediated activity, e.g., a biological activity described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Calculations of homology or sequence identity between sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the 44576 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 200 amino acid residues, at least 170, preferably at least 100, more preferably at least 50, even more preferably at least 25, and even more preferably at least 20, or 16 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;homology&rdquo;). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (<highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. (</italic></highlight>48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3,4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A particularly preferred set of parameters (and the one that should be used if the practitioner is uncertain about what parameters should be applied) is using a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap open penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. </paragraph>

Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to orthologs, homologs, and allelic variants of the 44576 cDNAs of the invention can further be isolated by mapping to the same chromosome or locus as the 44576 gene. Preferred variants include those that are correlated with any of the 44576 biological activities described herein, e.g., regulating, sensing and/or transmitting an extracellular signal into a cell; interacting with (e.g., binding to) an extracellular signal or a cell surface receptor; mobilizing an intracellular molecule that participates in a signal transduction pathway; regulating polarization of the plasma membrane; controlling production or secretion of molecules; altering the structure of a cellular component; modulating cell proliferation, e.g., synthesis of DNA; and modulating cell migration, cell differentiation; and cell survival. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Allelic variants of 44576, e.g., human 44576, include both functional and non-functional proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the 44576 protein within a population that maintain the ability to mediate any of the 44576 biological activities described herein, e.g., regulating, sensing and/or transmitting an extracellular signal into a cell; interacting with (e.g., binding to) an extracellular signal or a cell surface receptor; mobilizing an intracellular molecule that participates in a signal transduction pathway; regulating polarization of the plasma membrane; controlling production or secretion of molecules; altering the structure of a cellular component; modulating cell proliferation, e.g., synthesis of DNA; and modulating cell migration, cell differentiation; and cell survival. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Functional allelic variants will typically contain only conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, or substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally-occurring amino acid sequence variants of the 44576, e.g., human 44576, protein within a population that do not have the ability to mediate any of the 44576 biological activities described herein. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other 44576 family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the 44576 sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, or the nucleotide sequence of the DNA insert of the plasmid deposited with ATCC as Accession Number ______ are intended to be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Antisense Nucleic Acid Molecules, Ribozymes and Modified 44576 Nucleic Acid Molecules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, an isolated nucleic acid molecule which is antisense to 44576. An &ldquo;antisense&rdquo; nucleic acid can include a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; nucleic acid encoding a protein, e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule or complementary to an mRNA sequence. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire 44576 coding strand, or to only a portion thereof (e.g., the coding region of human 44576 corresponding to SEQ ID NO:3). In another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule is antisense to a &ldquo;noncoding region&rdquo; of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding 44576 (e.g., the 5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated regions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> An antisense nucleic acid can be designed such that it is complementary to the entire coding region of 44576 mRNA, but more preferably is an oligonucleotide which is antisense to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of 44576 mRNA. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of 44576 mRNA, e.g., between the &minus;10 and &plus;10 regions of the target gene nucleotide sequence of interest. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or more nucleotides in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> An antisense nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. The antisense nucleic acid also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned in an antisense orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest, described further in the following subsection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention are typically administered to a subject (e.g., by direct injection at a tissue site), or generated in situ such that they hybridize with or bind to cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA encoding a 44576 protein to thereby inhibit expression of the protein, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For systemic administration, antisense molecules can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules can also be delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in which the antisense nucleic acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol II or pol III promoter are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention is an &agr;-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An a-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual &bgr;-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids. Res. </italic></highlight>15:6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2&prime;-o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>15:6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>215:327-330). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid of the invention is a ribozyme. A ribozyme having specificity for a 44576-encoding nucleic acid can include one or more sequences complementary to the the nucleotide sequence of a 44576 cDNA disclosed herein (i.e., SEQ ID NO:1 or 3), and a sequence having known catalytic sequence responsible for mRNA cleavage (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,246 or Haselhoff and Gerlach (1988) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>334:585-591). For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved in a 44576-encoding mRNA. See, e.g., Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,742. Alternatively, 44576 mRNA can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See, e.g., Bartel, D. and Szostak, J. W. (1993) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>261:1411-1418. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> 44576 gene expression can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the 44576 (e.g., the 44576 promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the 44576 gene in target cells. See generally, Helene, C. (1991) <highlight><italic>Anticancer Drug Des. </italic></highlight>6(6):569-84; Helene, C. et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>660:27-36; and Maher, L. J. (1992) <highlight><italic>Bioassays </italic></highlight>14(12):807-15. The potential sequences that can be targeted for triple helix formation can be increased by creating a so called &ldquo;switchback&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule. Switchback molecules are synthesized in an alternating 5&prime;-3&prime;, 3&prime;-5&prime; manner, such that they base pair with first one strand of a duplex and then the other, eliminating the necessity for a sizeable stretch of either purines or pyrimidines to be present on one strand of a duplex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides detectably labeled oligonucleotide primer and probe molecules. Typically, such labels are chemiluminescent, fluorescent, radioactive, or calorimetric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A 44576 nucleic acid molecule can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g., the stability, hybridization, or solubility of the molecule. For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid molecules can be modified to generate peptide nucleic acids (see Hyrup B. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bioorganic </italic></highlight>&amp; <highlight><italic>Medicinal Chemistry </italic></highlight>4 (1): 5-23). As used herein, the terms &ldquo;peptide nucleic acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;PNA&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid mimic, e.g., a DNA mimic, in which the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural nucleobases are retained. The neutral backbone of a PNA can allow for specific hybridization to DNA and RNA under conditions of low ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can be performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra; Perry-O&apos;Keefe et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93: 14670-675. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> PNAs of 44576 nucleic acid molecules can be used in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. For example, PNAs can be used as antisense or antigene agents for sequence-specific modulation of gene expression by, for example, inducing transcription or translation arrest or inhibiting replication. PNAs of 44576 nucleic acid molecules can also be used in the analysis of single base pair mutations in a gene, (e.g., by PNA-directed PCR clamping); as &lsquo;artificial restriction enzymes&rsquo; when used in combination with other enzymes, (e.g., S1 nucleases (Hyrup B. (1996) supra)); or as probes or primers for DNA sequencing or hybridization (Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra; Perry-O&apos;Keefe supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>84:648-652; PCT Publication No. WO88/09810) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO89/10134). In addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (See, e.g., Krol et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Bio</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Techniques </italic></highlight>6:958-976) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., Zon (1988) <highlight><italic>Pharm. Res. </italic></highlight>5:539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, (e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, or hybridization-triggered cleavage agent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes molecular beacon oligonucleotide primer and probe molecules having at least one region which is complementary to a 44576 nucleic acid of the invention, two complementary regions one having a fluorophore and one a quencher such that the molecular beacon is useful for quantitating the presence of the 44576 nucleic acid of the invention in a sample. Molecular beacon nucleic acids are described, for example, in Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033; Nazarenko et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,336, and Livak et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,930. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, an isolated 44576 protein, or fragment, e.g., a biologically active portion, for use as immunogens or antigens to raise or test (or more generally to bind) anti-44576 antibodies. 44576 protein can be isolated from cells or tissue sources using standard protein purification techniques. 44576 protein or fragments thereof can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or synthesized chemically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides of the invention include those which arise as a result of the existence of multiple genes, alternative transcription events, alternative RNA splicing events, and alternative translational and postranslational events. The polypeptide can be expressed in systems, e.g., cultured cells, which result in substantially the same postranslational modifications present when expressed the polypeptide is expressed in a native cell, or in systems which result in the alteration or omission of postranslational modifications, e.g., gylcosylation or cleavage, present when expressed in a native cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the 44576 protein, or fragment thereof, differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2. In one embodiment it differs by at least one but by less than 15, 10 or 5 amino acid residues. In another it differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 by at least one residue but less than 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% of the residues in it differ from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2. (If this comparison requires alignment the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. &ldquo;Looped&rdquo; out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.) The differences are, preferably, differences or changes at a non essential residue or a conservative substitution. In a preferred embodiment, the differences are not in amino acid residues 1-45, 46-63, 79-102, 123-142, 151-173, 193-211, 230-254, 264-280 and 281-374 of SEQ ID NO:2. In another preferred embodiment, one or more differences are in amino acid residues 145, 46-63, 79-102, 123-142, 151-173, 193-211, 230-254, 264-280 and 281-374 of SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments include a protein that contain one or more changes in amino acid sequence, e.g., a change in an amino acid residue which is not essential for activity. Such 44576 proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, yet retain biological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the protein includes an amino acid sequence at least about 65%, 70%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> A 44576 protein or fragment is provided which varies from the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 in regions 103-122, 174-192 or 255-263 by at least one but by less than 15, 10 or 5 amino acid residues in the protein or fragment but which does not differ from SEQ ID NO:2 in regions 46-63, 79-102, 123-142, 151-173, 193-211, 230-254 or 264-280.

In some embodiments the difference is at a non essential residue or is a conservative substitution, while in others the difference is at an essential residue or is a non conservative substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a 44576 protein includes an N- or a C-terminal region of human 44576. Alternatively, the biologically active portion of a 44576 protein a transmembrane domain of human 44576. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the 44576 protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2. In other embodiments, the 44576 protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:2. In yet another embodiment, the 44576 protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:2 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO:2, as described above. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the 44576 protein is a protein which includes an amino acid sequence at least about 65%, 70%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO:2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> 44576 Chimeric or Fusion Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides 44576 chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a 44576 &ldquo;chimeric protein&rdquo; or &ldquo;fusion protein&rdquo; includes a 44576 polypeptide linked to a non-44576 polypeptide. A &ldquo;non-44576 polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein which is not substantially homologous to the 44576 protein, e.g., a protein which is different from the 44576 protein and which is derived from the same or a different organism. The 44576 polypeptide of the fusion protein can correspond to all or a portion e.g., a fragment described herein of a 44576 amino acid sequence. In a preferred embodiment, a 44576 fusion protein includes at least one (or two) biologically active portion of a 44576 protein. The non-44576 polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the 44576 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The fusion protein can include a moiety which has a high affinity for a ligand. For example, the fusion protein can be a GST-44576 fusion protein in which the 44576 sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant 44576. Alternatively, the fusion protein can be a 44576 protein containing a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus. In certain host cells (e.g., mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of 44576 can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Fusion proteins can include all or a part of a serum protein, e.g., an IgG constant region, or human serum albumin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The 44576 fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject in vivo. The 44576 fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a 44576 substrate. 44576 fusion proteins may be useful therapeutically for the treatment of disorders caused by, for example, (i) aberrant modification or mutation of a gene encoding a 44576 protein; (ii) mis-regulation of the 44576 gene; and (iii) aberrant post-translational modification of a 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the 44576-fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-44576 antibodies in a subject, to purify 44576 ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of 44576 with a 44576 substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A 44576-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Variants of 44576 Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention also features a variant of a 44576 polypeptide, e.g., which functions as an agonist (mimetics) or as an antagonist. Variants of the 44576 proteins can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation, the insertion or deletion of sequences or the truncation of a 44576 protein. An agonist of the 44576 proteins can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of a 44576 protein. An antagonist of a 44576 protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally occurring form of the 44576 protein by, for example, competitively modulating a 44576-mediated activity of a 44576 protein. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant of limited function. Preferably, treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein has fewer side effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Variants of a 44576 protein can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g., truncation mutants, of a 44576 protein for agonist or antagonist activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Libraries of fragments e.g., N terminal, C terminal, or internal fragments, of a 44576 protein coding sequence can be used to generate a variegated population of fragments for screening and subsequent selection of variants of a 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Variants in which a cysteine residues is added or deleted or in which a residue which is glycosylated is added or deleted are particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Methods for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a new technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify 44576 variants (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Protein Engineering </italic></highlight>6(3):327-331). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Cell based assays can be exploited to analyze a variegated 44576 library. For example, a library of expression vectors can be transfected into a cell line, e.g., a cell line, which ordinarily responds to 44576 in a substrate-dependent manner. The transfected cells are then contacted with 44576 and the effect of the expression of the mutant on signaling by the 44576 substrate can be detected, e.g., by measuring changes in cell growth and/or enzymatic activity. Plasmid DNA can then be recovered from the cells which score for inhibition, or alternatively, potentiation of signaling by the 44576 substrate, and the individual clones further characterized. </paragraph>

The method includes: altering the sequence, e.g., by substitution or deletion of one or more residues, of a 44576 polypeptide, e.g., altering the sequence of a non-conserved region, or a s domain or residue described herein, and testing the altered polypeptide for the desired activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Anti-44576 Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides an anti-44576 antibody. The term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule or immunologically active portion thereof, i.e., an antigen-binding portion. The antibody can be a polyclonal, monoclonal, recombinant, e.g., a chimeric or humanized, fully human, non-human, e.g., murine, or single chain antibody, or a fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody has effector function and can fix complement The antibody or a fragment thereof can be coupled to a toxin or imaging agent. Examples of immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules include F(ab) and F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody with an enzyme such as pepsin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> A full-length 44576 protein or, antigenic peptide fragment of 44576 can be used as an immunogen or can be used to identify anti-44576 antibodies made with other immunogens, e.g., cells, membrane preparations, and the like. The antigenic peptide of 44576 should include at least 8 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and encompasses an epitope of 44576. Preferably, the antigenic peptide includes at least 10 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 15 amino acid residues, even more preferably at least 20 amino acid residues, and most preferably at least 30 amino acid residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Fragments of 44576 which include residues 1-45, 103-122, 174-192, or 255-263 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make, e.g., used as immunogens or used to characterize the specificity of an antibody, antibodies against regions of the 44576 protein which are believed to be extracellular. Similarly, a fragment of 44576 which include residues 46-63, 79-102, 123-142, 151-173, 193-211, 230-254, or 264-280 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against a region of the 44576 protein which is believed to reside in the transmembrane; a fragment of 44576 which include residues 64-78, 143-150, 212-229 or 281-374 of SEQ ID NO:2 can be used to make an antibody against a region of the 44576 protein which is believed to be intracellular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Antibodies reactive with, or specific for, any of these regions, or other regions or domains described herein are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes encompassed by the antigenic peptide are regions of 44576 are located on the surface of the protein, e.g., hydrophilic regions, as well as regions with high antigenicity. For example, an Emini surface probability analysis of the human 44576 protein sequence can be used to indicate the regions that have a particularly high probability of being localized to the surface of the 44576 protein and are thus likely to constitute surface residues useful for targeting antibody production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the antibody can bind to the extracellular portion of the 44576 protein, e.g., it can bind to a whole cell which expresses the 44576 protein. In another embodiment, the antibody binds an intracellular portion of the 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the antibody binds an epitope on any domain or region on 44576 proteins described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Chimeric, humanized, but most preferably, completely human antibodies are desirable for applications which include repeated administration, e.g., therapeutic treatment (and some diagnostic applications) of human patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The anti-44576 antibody can be a single chain antibody. A single-chain antibody (scFV) may be engineered (see, for example, Colcher, D., et al. <highlight><italic>Ann N Y Acad Sci </italic></highlight>1999 June 30;880:263-80; and Reiter, Y. <highlight><italic>Clin Cancer Res </italic></highlight>1996 February;2(2):245-52). The single chain antibody can be dimerized or multimerized to generate multivalent antibodies having specificities for different epitopes of the same target 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> An anti-44576 antibody (e.g., monoclonal antibody) can be used to isolate 44576 by standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Moreover, an anti-44576 antibody can be used to detect 44576 protein (e.g., in a cellular lysate or cell supernatant) in order to evaluate the abundance and pattern of expression of the protein. Anti-44576 antibodies can be used diagnostically to monitor protein levels in tissue as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to, for example, determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling (i.e., physically linking) the antibody to a detectable substance (i.e., antibody labelling). Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, &bgr;-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Recombinant Expression Vectors, Host Cells and Genetically Engineered Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention includes, vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide described herein. As used herein, the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked and can include a plasmid, cosmid or viral vector. The vector can be capable of autonomous replication or it can integrate into a host DNA. Viral vectors include, e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A vector can include a 44576 nucleic acid in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. Preferably the recombinant expression vector includes one or more regulatory sequences operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. The term &ldquo;regulatory sequence&rdquo; includes promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence, as well as tissue-specific regulatory and/or inducible sequences. The design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or polypeptides, including fusion proteins or polypeptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., 44576 proteins, mutant forms of 44576 proteins, fusion proteins, and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression of 44576 proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, polypeptides of the invention can be expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, insect cells (e.g., using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S. (1988) <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Purified fusion proteins can be used in 44576 activity assays, (e.g., direct assays or competitive assays described in detail below), or to generate antibodies specific for 44576 proteins. In a preferred embodiment, a fusion protein expressed in a retroviral expression vector of the present invention can be used to infect bone marrow cells which are subsequently transplanted into irradiated recipients. The pathology of the subject recipient is then examined after sufficient time has passed (e.g., six (6) weeks). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> To maximize recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to express the protein in a host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, S., <highlight><italic>Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 119-128). Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(Wada et al., (1992) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The 44576 expression vector can be a yeast expression vector, a vector for expression in insect cells, e.g., a baculovirus expression vector or a vector suitable for expression in mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector&apos;s control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) <highlight><italic>Adv. Immunol. </italic></highlight>43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter, Byrne and Ruddle (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example, the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>249:374-379) and the &agr;-fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>3:537-546). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA molecule of the invention cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Regulatory sequences (e.g., viral promoters and/or enhancers) operatively linked to a nucleic acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the constitutive, tissue specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA in a variety of cell types. The antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid or attenuated virus. For a discussion of the regulation of gene expression using antisense genes see Weintraub, H. et al., Antisense RNA as a molecular tool for genetic analysis, <highlight><italic>Reviews&mdash;Trends in Genetics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1(1) 1986. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Another aspect the invention provides a host cell which includes a nucleic acid molecule described herein, e.g., a 44576 nucleic acid molecule within a recombinant expression vector or a 44576 nucleic acid molecule containing sequences which allow it to homologously recombine into a specific site of the host cell&apos;s genome. The terms &ldquo;host cell&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant host cell&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein. Such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a 44576 protein can be expressed in bacterial cells such as <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Vector DNA can be introduced into host cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfection&rdquo; are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A host cell of the invention can be used to produce (i.e., express) a 44576 protein. Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a 44576 protein using the host cells of the invention. In one embodiment, the method includes culturing the host cell of the invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a 44576 protein has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a 44576 protein is produced. In another embodiment, the method further includes isolating a 44576 protein from the medium or the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a cell or purified preparation of cells which include a 44576 transgene, or which otherwise misexpress 44576. The cell preparation can consist of human or non human cells, e.g., rodent cells, e.g., mouse or rat cells, rabbit cells, or pig cells. In preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a 44576 transgene, e.g., a heterologous form of a 44576, e.g., a gene derived from humans (in the case of a non-human cell). The 44576 transgene can be misexpressed, e.g., overexpressed or underexpressed. In other preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a gene which misexpress an endogenous 44576, e.g., a gene the expression of which is disrupted, e.g., a knockout. Such cells can serve as a model for studying disorders which are related to mutated or mis-expressed 44576 alleles or for use in drug screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a human cell, e.g., a hematopoietic stem cell, transformed with nucleic acid which encodes a subject 44576 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Also provided are cells in which an endogenous 44576 is under the control of a regulatory sequence that does not normally control the expression of the endogenous 44576 gene. The expression characteristics of an endogenous gene within a cell, e.g., a cell line or microorganism, can be modified by inserting a heterologous DNA regulatory element into the genome of the cell such that the inserted regulatory element is operably linked to the endogenous 44576 gene. For example, an endogenous 44576 gene, e.g., a gene which is &ldquo;transcriptionally silent,&rdquo; e.g., not normally expressed, or expressed only at very low levels, may be activated by inserting a regulatory element which is capable of promoting the expression of a normally expressed gene product in that cell. Techniques such as targeted homologous recombinations, can be used to insert the heterologous DNA as described in, e.g., Chappel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,071; WO 91/06667, published in May 16, 1991. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Transgenic Animals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The invention provides non-human transgenic animals. Such animals are useful for studying the function and/or activity of a 44576 protein and for identifying and/or evaluating modulators of 44576 activity. As used herein, a &ldquo;transgenic animal&rdquo; is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a rodent such as a rat or mouse, in which one or more of the cells of the animal includes a transgene. Other examples of transgenic animals include non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cows, goats, chickens, amphibians, and the like. A transgene is exogenous DNA or a rearrangment, e.g., a deletion of endogenous chromosomal DNA, which preferably is integrated into or occurs in the genome of the cells of a transgenic animal. A transgene can direct the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic animal, other transgenes, e.g., a knockout, reduce expression. Thus, a transgenic animal can be one in which an endogenous 44576 gene has been altered by, e.g., by homologous recombination between the endogenous gene and an exogenous DNA molecule introduced into a cell of the animal, e.g., an embryonic cell of the animal, prior to development of the animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Intronic sequences and polyadenylation signals can also be included in the transgene to increase the efficiency of expression of the transgene. A tissue-specific regulatory sequence(s) can be operably linked to a transgene of the invention to direct expression of a 44576 protein to particular cells. A transgenic founder animal can be identified based upon the presence of a 44576 transgene in its genome and/or expression of 44576 mRNA in tissues or cells of the animals. A transgenic founder animal can then be used to breed additional animals carrying the transgene. Moreover, transgenic animals carrying a transgene encoding a 44576 protein can further be bred to other transgenic animals carrying other transgenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> 44576 proteins or polypeptides can be expressed in transgenic animals or plants, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding the protein or polypeptide can be introduced into the genome of an animal. In preferred embodiments the nucleic acid is placed under the control of a tissue specific promoter, e.g., a milk or egg specific promoter, and recovered from the milk or eggs produced by the animal. Suitable animals are mice, pigs, cows, goats, and sheep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a population of cells from a transgenic animal, as discussed, e.g., below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules, proteins, protein homologues, and antibodies described herein can be used in one or more of the following methods: a) screening assays; b) predictive medicine (e.g., diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, monitoring clinical trials, and pharmacogenetics); and c) methods of treatment (e.g., therapeutic and prophylactic). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The isolated nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be used, for example, to express a 44576 protein (e.g., via a recombinant expression vector in a host cell in gene therapy applications), to detect a 44576 mRNA (e.g., in a biological sample) or a genetic alteration in a 44576 gene, and to modulate 44576 activity, as described further below. The 44576 proteins can be used to treat disorders characterized by insufficient or excessive production of a 44576 substrate or production of 44576 inhibitors. In addition, the 44576 proteins can be used to screen for naturally occurring 44576 substrates, to screen for drugs or compounds which modulate 44576 activity, as well as to treat disorders characterized by insufficient or excessive production of 44576 protein or production of 44576 protein forms which have decreased, aberrant or unwanted activity compared to 44576 wild type protein Exemplary disorders include: conditions involving aberrant or deficient transmission of an extracellular signal into a cell, for example, a bone cell (e.g., an osteoclast or an osteoblast), a hematopoietic cell, a neural cell, a heart cell); conditions involving aberrant or deficient mobilization of an intracellular molecule that participates in a signal transduction pathway; and/or conditions involving aberrant or deficient modulation of function, survival, morphology, proliferation and/or differentiation of cells of tissues in which 44576 molecules are expressed (e.g, bone cells, hematopoietic cells, brain cells, trachea, skeletal muscle, skin, testis, breast, ovary, placenta and heart). Moreover, the anti-44576 antibodies of the invention can be used to detect and isolate 44576 proteins, regulate the bioavailability of 44576 proteins, and modulate 44576 activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> A method of evaluating a compound for the ability to interact with, e.g., bind, a subject 44576 polypeptide is provided. The method includes: contacting the compound with the subject 44576 polypeptide; and evaluating ability of the compound to interact with, e.g., to bind or form a complex with the subject 44576 polypeptide. This method can be performed in vitro, e.g., in a cell free system, or in vivo, e.g., in a two-hybrid interaction trap assay. This method can be used to identify naturally occurring molecules which interact with subject 44576 polypeptide. It can also be used to find natural or synthetic inhibitors of subject 44576 polypeptide. Screening methods are discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Screening Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as &ldquo;screening assays&rdquo;) for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small molecules or other drugs) which bind to 44576 proteins, have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for example, 44576 expression or 44576 activity, or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for example, the expression or activity of a 44576 substrate. Compounds thus identified can be used to modulate the activity of target gene products (e.g., 44576 genes) in a therapeutic protocol, to elaborate the biological function of the target gene product, or to identify compounds that disrupt normal target gene interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which are substrates of a 44576 protein or polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof. In another embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which bind to or modulate the activity of a 44576 protein or polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In any screening assay, a 44576 polypeptide which may have an extracellular region, (e.g., amino acids 145, 103-122, 174-192 or 255-263 of SEQ ID NO:2), or an intracellular region (e.g., amino acids 64-78, 143-150 or 212-229 of SEQ ID NO:2) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The test compounds of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; peptoid libraries &lsqb;libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides, but with a novel, non-peptide backbone which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but which nevertheless remain bioactive&rsqb; (see, e.g., Zuckermann, R. N. et al. <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>1994, 37: 2678-85); spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the &lsquo;one-bead one-compound&rsquo; library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library and peptoid library approaches are limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, K.

<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an assay is a cell-based assay in which a cell which expresses a 44576 protein or biologically active portion thereof is contacted with a test compound, and the ability of the test compound to modulate 44576 activity is determined. Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate 44576 activity can be accomplished by monitoring, for example, changes in enzymatic activity. The cell, for example, can be of mammalian origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The ability of the test compound to modulate 44576 binding to a compound, e.g., a 44576 substrate, or to bind to 44576 can also be evaluated. This can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the compound, e.g., the substrate, with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the compound, e.g., the substrate, to 44576 can be determined by detecting the labeled compound, e.g., substrate, in a complex. Alternatively, 44576 could be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label to monitor the ability of a test compound to modulate 44576 binding to a 44576 substrate in a complex. For example, compounds (e.g., 44576 substrates) can be labeled with <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C, or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, compounds can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The ability of a compound (e.g., a 44576 substrate) to interact with 44576 with or without the labeling of any of the interactants can be evaluated. For example, a microphysiometer can be used to detect the interaction of a compound with 44576 without the labeling of either the compound or the 44576. McConnell, H. M. et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>257:1906-1912. As used herein, a &ldquo;microphysiometer&rdquo; (e.g., Cytosensor) is an analytical instrument that measures the rate at which a cell acidifies its environment using a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). Changes in this acidification rate can be used as an indicator of the interaction between a compound and 44576. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a cell-free assay is provided in which a 44576 protein or biologically active portion thereof is contacted with a test compound and the ability of the test compound to bind to the 44576 protein or biologically active portion thereof is evaluated. Preferred biologically active portions of the 44576 proteins to be used in assays of the present invention include fragments which participate in interactions with non-44576 molecules, e.g., fragments with high surface probability scores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Soluble and/or membrane-bound forms of isolated proteins (e.g., 44576 proteins or biologically active portions thereof) can be used in the cell-free assays of the invention. When membrane-bound forms of the protein are used, it may be desirable to utilize a solubilizing agent. Examples of such solubilizing agents include non-ionic detergents such as n-octylglucoside, n-dodecylglucoside, n-dodecylmaltoside, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, Triton&reg; X-100, Triton&reg; X-114, Thesit&reg;, Isotridecypoly(ethylene glycol ether)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, 3-&lsqb;(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio&rsqb;-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), 3-&lsqb;(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio&rsqb;-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO), or N-dodecyl&equals;N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Cell-free assays involve preparing a reaction mixture of the target gene protein and the test compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to interact and bind, thus forming a complex that can be removed and/or detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The interaction between two molecules can also be detected, e.g., using fluorescence energy transfer (FET) (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first, &lsquo;donor&rsquo; molecule is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second, &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule, which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately, the &lsquo;donor&rsquo; protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light, such that the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label may be differentiated from that of the &lsquo;donor&rsquo;. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the &lsquo;acceptor&rsquo; molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, determining the ability of the 44576 protein to bind to a target molecule can be accomplished using real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) (see, e.g., Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C. (1991) <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>63:2338-2345 and Szabo et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. </italic></highlight>5:699-705). &ldquo;Surface plasmon resonance&rdquo; or &ldquo;BIA&rdquo; detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BIAcore). Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)), resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the target gene product or the test substance is anchored onto a solid phase. The target gene product/test compound complexes anchored on the solid phase can be detected at the end of the reaction. Preferably, the target gene product can be anchored onto a solid surface, and the test compound, (which is not anchored), can be labeled, either directly or indirectly, with detectable labels discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to immobilize either 44576, an anti 44576 antibody or its target molecule to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test compound to a 44576 protein, or interaction of a 44576 protein with a target molecule in the presence and absence of a candidate compound, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtiter plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S-transferase/44576 fusion proteins or glutathione-S-transferase/target fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtiter plates, which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non-adsorbed target protein or 44576 protein, and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g., at physiological conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation, the beads or microtiter plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components, the matrix immobilized in the case of beads, complex determined either directly or indirectly, for example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix, and the level of 44576 binding or activity determined using standard techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Other techniques for immobilizing either a 44576 protein or a target molecule on matrices include using conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated 44576 protein or target molecules can be prepared from biotin-NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In order to conduct the assay, the non-immobilized component is added to the coated surface containing the anchored component. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the previously non-immobilized component is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the previously non-immobilized component is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the immobilized component (the antibody, in turn, can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with, e.g., a labeled anti-Ig antibody). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, this assay is performed utilizing antibodies reactive with 44576 protein or target molecules but which do not interfere with binding of the 44576 protein to its target molecule. Such antibodies can be derivatized to the wells of the plate, and unbound target or 44576 protein trapped in the wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes, in addition to those described above for the GST-immobilized complexes, include immunodetection of complexes using antibodies reactive with the 44576 protein or target molecule, as well as enzyme-linked assays which rely on detecting an enzymatic activity associated with the 44576 protein or target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, cell free assays can be conducted in a liquid phase. In such an assay, the reaction products are separated from unreacted components, by any of a number of standard techniques, including but not limited to: differential centrifugation (see, for example, Rivas, G., and Minton, A. P., <highlight><italic>Trends Biochem Sci </italic></highlight>1993 August;18(8):284-7); chromatography (gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography); electrophoresis (see, e.g., Ausubel, F. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 1999, J. Wiley: New York.); and immunoprecipitation (see, for example, Ausubel, F. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 1999, J. Wiley: New York). Such resins and chromatographic techniques are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Heegaard, N. H., <highlight><italic>J Mol Recognit </italic></highlight>1998 Winter;11(1-6):141-8; Hage, D. S., and Tweed, S. A. <highlight><italic>J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl Oct. </italic></highlight>10, 1997;699(1-2):499-525). Further, fluorescence energy transfer may also be conveniently utilized, as described herein, to detect binding without further purification of the complex from solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the assay includes contacting the 44576 protein or biologically active portion thereof with a known compound which binds 44576 to form an assay mixture, contacting the assay mixture with a test compound, and determining the ability of the test compound to interact with a 44576 protein, wherein determining the ability of the test compound to interact with a 44576 protein includes determining the ability of the test compound to preferentially bind to 44576 or biologically active portion thereof, or to modulate the activity of a target molecule, as compared to the known compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The target gene products of the invention can, in vivo, interact with one or more cellular or extracellular macromolecules, such as proteins. For the purposes of this discussion, such cellular and extracellular macromolecules are referred to herein as &ldquo;binding partners.&rdquo; Compounds that disrupt such interactions can be useful in regulating the activity of the target gene product. Such compounds can include, but are not limited to molecules such as antibodies, peptides, and small molecules. The preferred target genes/products for use in this embodiment are the 44576 genes herein identified. In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides methods for determining the ability of the test compound to modulate the activity of a 44576 protein through modulation of the activity of a downstream effector of a 44576 target molecule. For example, the activity of the effector molecule on an appropriate target can be determined, or the binding of the effector to an appropriate target can be determined, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> To identify compounds that interfere with the interaction between the target gene product and its cellular or extracellular binding partner(s), a reaction mixture containing the target gene product and the binding partner is prepared, under conditions and for a time sufficient, to allow the two products to form complex. In order to test an inhibitory agent, the reaction mixture is provided in the presence and absence of the test compound. The test compound can be initially included in the reaction mixture, or can be added at a time subsequent to the addition of the target gene and its cellular or extracellular binding partner. Control reaction mixtures are incubated without the test compound or with a placebo. The formation of any complexes between the target gene product and the cellular or extracellular binding partner is then detected. The formation of a complex in the control reaction, but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound, indicates that the compound interferes with the interaction of the target gene product and the interactive binding partner. Additionally, complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and normal target gene product can also be compared to complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and mutant target gene product. This comparison can be important in those cases wherein it is desirable to identify compounds that disrupt interactions of mutant but not normal target gene products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> These assays can be conducted in a heterogeneous or homogeneous format. Heterogeneous assays involve anchoring either the target gene product or the binding partner onto a solid phase, and detecting complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In homogeneous assays, the entire reaction is carried out in a liquid phase. In either approach, the order of addition of reactants can be varied to obtain different information about the compounds being tested. For example, test compounds that interfere with the interaction between the target gene products and the binding partners, e.g., by competition, can be identified by conducting the reaction in the presence of the test substance. Alternatively, test compounds that disrupt preformed complexes, e.g., compounds with higher binding constants that displace one of the components from the complex, can be tested by adding the test compound to the reaction mixture after complexes have been formed. The various formats are briefly described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In a heterogeneous assay system, either the target gene product or the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner, is anchored onto a solid surface (e.g., a microtiter plate), while the non-anchored species is labeled, either directly or indirectly. The anchored species can be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent attachments. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody specific for the species to be anchored can be used to anchor the species to the solid surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In order to conduct the assay, the partner of the immobilized species is exposed to the coated surface with or without the test compound. After the reaction is complete, unreacted components are removed (e.g., by washing) and any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. Where the non-immobilized species is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the non-immobilized species is not pre-labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; e.g., using a labeled antibody specific for the initially non-immobilized species (the antibody, in turn, can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with, e.g., a labeled anti-Ig antibody). Depending upon the order of addition of reaction components, test compounds that inhibit complex formation or that disrupt preformed complexes can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase in the presence or absence of the test compound, the reaction products separated from unreacted components, and complexes detected; e.g., using an immobilized antibody specific for one of the binding components to anchor any complexes formed in solution, and a labeled antibody specific for the other partner to detect anchored complexes. Again, depending upon the order of addition of reactants to the liquid phase, test compounds that inhibit complex or that disrupt preformed complexes can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment of the invention, a homogeneous assay can be used. For example, a preformed complex of the target gene product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product is prepared in that either the target gene products or their binding partners are labeled, but the signal generated by the label is quenched due to complex formation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,496 that utilizes this approach for immunoassays). The addition of a test substance that competes with and displaces one of the species from the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal above background. In this way, test substances that disrupt target gene product-binding partner interaction can be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the 44576 proteins can be used as &ldquo;bait proteins&rdquo; in a two-hybrid assay or three-hybrid assay (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,317; Zervos et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>72:223-232; Madura et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>268:12046-12054; Bartel et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>14:920-924; Iwabuchi et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>8:1693-1696; and Brent WO94/10300), to identify other proteins, which bind to or interact with 44576 (&ldquo;44576-binding proteins&rdquo; or &ldquo;44576-bp&rdquo;) and are involved in 44576 activity. Such 44576-bps can be activators or inhibitors of signals by the 44576 proteins or 44576 targets as, for example, downstream elements of a 44576-mediated signaling pathway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The two-hybrid system is based on the modular nature of most transcription factors, which consist of separable DNA-binding and activation domains. Briefly, the assay utilizes two different DNA constructs. In one construct, the gene that codes for a 44576 protein is fused to a gene encoding the DNA binding domain of a known transcription factor (e.g., GAL-4). In the other construct, a DNA sequence, from a library of DNA sequences, that encodes an unidentified protein (&ldquo;prey&rdquo; or &ldquo;sample&rdquo;) is fused to a gene that codes for the activation domain of the known transcription factor. (Alternatively the: 44576 protein can be the fused to the activator domain.) If the &ldquo;bait&rdquo; and the &ldquo;prey&rdquo; proteins are able to interact, in vivo, forming a 44576-dependent complex, the DNA-binding and activation domains of the transcription factor are brought into close proximity. This proximity allows transcription of a reporter gene (e.g., LacZ) which is operably linked to a transcriptional regulatory site responsive to the transcription factor. Expression of the reporter gene can be detected and cell colonies containing the functional transcription factor can be isolated and used to obtain the cloned gene which encodes the protein which interacts with the 44576 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, modulators of 44576 expression are identified. For example, a cell or cell free mixture is contacted with a candidate compound and the expression of 44576 mRNA or protein evaluated relative to the level of expression of 44576 mRNA or protein in the absence of the candidate compound. When expression of 44576 mRNA or protein is greater in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as a stimulator of 44576 mRNA or protein expression. Alternatively, when expression of 44576 mRNA or protein is less (statistically significantly less) in the presence of the candidate compound than in its absence, the candidate compound is identified as an inhibitor of 44576 mRNA or protein expression. The level of 44576 mRNA or protein expression can be determined by methods described herein for detecting 44576 mRNA or protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention pertains to a combination of two or more of the assays described herein. For example, a modulating agent can be identified using a cell-based or a cell free assay, and the ability of the agent to modulate the activity of a 44576 protein can be confirmed in vivo, e.g., in an animal such as an animal model for a GPCR-disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> This invention further pertains to novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an agent identified as described herein (e.g., a 44576 modulating agent, an antisense 44576 nucleic acid molecule, a 44576-specific antibody, or a 44576-binding partner) in an appropriate animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, side effects, or mechanism of action, of treatment with such an agent. Furthermore, novel agents identified by the above-described screening assays can be used for treatments as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Detection Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Portions or fragments of the nucleic acid sequences identified herein can be used as polynucleotide reagents. For example, these sequences can be used to: (i) map their respective genes on a chromosome e.g., to locate gene regions associated with genetic disease or to associate 44576 with a disease; (ii) identify an individual from a minute biological sample (tissue typing); and (iii) aid in forensic identification of a biological sample. These applications are described in the subsections below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Chromosome Mapping </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The 44576 nucleotide sequences or portions thereof can be used to map the location of the 44576 genes on a chromosome. This process is called chromosome mapping. Chromosome mapping is useful in correlating the 44576 sequences with genes associated with disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Briefly, 44576 genes can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15-25 bp in length) from the 44576 nucleotide sequences. These primers can then be used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the 44576 sequences will yield an amplified fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> A panel of somatic cell hybrids in which each cell line contains either a single human chromosome or a small number of human chromosomes, and a full set of mouse chromosomes, can allow easy mapping of individual genes to specific human chromosomes. (D&apos;Eustachio P. et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>220:919-924). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Other mapping strategies e.g., in situ hybridization (described in Fan, Y. et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>87:6223-27), pre-screening with labeled flow-sorted chromosomes, and pre-selection by hybridization to chromosome specific cDNA libraries can be used to map 44576 to a chromosomal location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a DNA sequence to a metaphase chromosomal spread can further be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. The FISH technique can be used with a DNA sequence as short as 500 or 600 bases. However, clones larger than 1,000 bases have a higher likelihood of binding to a unique chromosomal location with sufficient signal intensity for simple detection. Preferably 1,000 bases, and more preferably 2,000 bases will suffice to get good results at a reasonable amount of time. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., Human Chromosomes: A Manual of Basic Techniques (Pergamon Press, New York 1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Reagents for chromosome mapping can be used individually to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome, or panels of reagents can be used for marking multiple sites and/or multiple chromosomes. Reagents corresponding to noncoding regions of the genes actually are preferred for mapping purposes. Coding sequences are more likely to be conserved within gene families, thus increasing the chance of cross hybridizations during chromosomal mapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. (Such data are found, for example, in V. McKusick, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, available on-line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library). The relationship between a gene and a disease, mapped to the same chromosomal region, can then be identified through linkage analysis (co-inheritance of physically adjacent genes), described in, for example, Egeland, J. et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>325:783-787. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Moreover, differences in the DNA sequences between individuals affected and unaffected with a disease associated with the 44576 gene, can be determined. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any unaffected individuals, then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the particular disease. Comparison of affected and unaffected individuals generally involves first looking for structural alterations in the chromosomes, such as deletions or translocations that are visible from chromosome spreads or detectable using PCR based on that DNA sequence. Ultimately, complete sequencing of genes from several individuals can be performed to confirm the presence of a mutation and to distinguish mutations from polymorphisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Tissue Typing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> 44576 sequences can be used to identify individuals from biological samples using, e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). In this technique, an individual&apos;s genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes, the fragments separated, e.g., in a Southern blot, and probed to yield bands for identification. The sequences of the present invention are useful as additional DNA markers for RFLP (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,057). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the sequences of the present invention can also be used to determine the actual base-by-base DNA sequence of selected portions of an individual&apos;s genome. Thus, the 44576 nucleotide sequences described herein can be used to prepare two PCR primers from the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the sequences. These primers can then be used to amplify an individual&apos;s DNA and subsequently sequence it. Panels of corresponding DNA sequences from individuals, prepared in this manner, can provide unique individual identifications, as each individual will have a unique set of such DNA sequences due to allelic differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Allelic variation occurs to some degree in the coding regions of these sequences, and to a greater degree in the noncoding regions. Each of the sequences described herein can, to some degree, be used as a standard against which DNA from an individual can be compared for identification purposes. Because greater numbers of polymorphisms occur in the noncoding regions, fewer sequences are necessary to differentiate individuals. The noncoding sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 can provide positive individual identification with a panel of perhaps 10 to 1,000 primers which each yield a noncoding amplified sequence of 100 bases. If predicted coding sequences, such as those in SEQ ID NO:3 are used, a more appropriate number of primers for positive individual identification would be 500-2,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> If a panel of reagents from 44576 nucleotide sequences described herein is used to generate a unique identification database for an individual, those same reagents can later be used to identify tissue from that individual. Using the unique identification database, positive identification of the individual, living or dead, can be made from extremely small tissue samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Use of Partial 44576 Sequences in Forensic Biology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> DNA-based identification techniques can also be used in forensic biology. To make such an identification, PCR technology can be used to amplify DNA sequences taken from very small biological samples such as tissues, e.g., hair or skin, or body fluids, e.g., blood, saliva, or semen found at a crime scene. The amplified sequence can then be compared to a standard, thereby allowing identification of the origin of the biological sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The sequences of the present invention can be used to provide polynucleotide reagents, e.g., PCR primers, targeted to specific loci in the human genome, which can enhance the reliability of DNA-based forensic identifications by, for example, providing another &ldquo;identification marker&rdquo; (i.e. another DNA sequence that is unique to a particular individual). As mentioned above, actual base sequence information can be used for identification as an accurate alternative to patterns formed by restriction enzyme generated fragments. Sequences targeted to noncoding regions of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., fragments derived from the noncoding regions of SEQ ID NO:1 having a length of at least 20 bases, preferably at least 30 bases) are particularly appropriate for this use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The 44576 nucleotide sequences described herein can further be used to provide polynucleotide reagents, e.g., labeled or labelable probes which can be used in, for example, an in situ hybridization technique, to identify a specific tissue, e.g., a tissue containing bone cells. This can be very useful in cases where a forensic pathologist is presented with a tissue of unknown origin. Panels of such 44576 probes can be used to identify tissue by species and/or by organ type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In a similar fashion, these reagents, e.g., 44576 primers or probes can be used to screen tissue culture for contamination (i.e. screen for the presence of a mixture of different types of cells in a culture). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Predictive Medicine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The present invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which diagnostic assays, prognostic assays, and monitoring clinical trials are used for prognostic (predictive) purposes to thereby treat an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Generally, the invention provides, a method of determining if a subject is at risk for a disorder related to a lesion in or the misexpression of a gene which encodes a 44576 polypeptide. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the presence or absence of a mutation which alters the structure of the 44576 gene; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the misexpression of the 44576 gene, at the mRNA level, e.g., detecting a non-wild type level of a mRNA; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> detecting, in a tissue of the subject, the misexpression of the gene, at the protein level, e.g., detecting a non-wild type level of a 44576 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes: ascertaining the existence of at least one of: a deletion of one or more nucleotides from the 44576 gene; an insertion of one or more nucleotides into the gene, a point mutation, e.g., a substitution of one or more nucleotides of the gene, a gross chromosomal rearrangement of the gene, e.g., a translocation, inversion, or deletion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> For example, detecting the genetic lesion can include: (i) providing a probe/primer including an oligonucleotide containing a region of nucleotide sequence which hybridizes to a sense or antisense sequence from SEQ ID NO:1, or naturally occurring mutants thereof or 5&prime; or 3&prime; flanking sequences naturally associated with the 44576 gene; (ii) exposing the probe/primer to nucleic acid of the tissue; and detecting, by hybridization, e.g., in situ hybridization, of the probe/primer to the nucleic acid, the presence or absence of the genetic lesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments detecting the misexpression includes ascertaining the existence of at least one of: an alteration in the level of a messenger RNA transcript of the 44576 gene; the presence of a non-wild type splicing pattern of a messenger RNA transcript of the gene; or a non-wild type level of the 44576 gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Methods of the invention can be used for prenatal screening, or to determine if a subject&apos;s offspring will be at risk for a disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes determining the structure of a 44576 gene, an abnormal structure being indicative of risk for the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments the method includes contacting a sample form the subject with an antibody to the 44576 protein or a nucleic acid, which hybridizes specifically with the gene. These and other embodiments are discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Diagnostic and Prognostic Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The presence, level, or absence of 44576 protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample can be evaluated by obtaining a biological sample from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting 44576 protein or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA, genomic DNA) that encodes 44576 protein such that the presence of 44576 protein or nucleic acid is detected in the biological sample. The term &ldquo;biological sample&rdquo; includes tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. A preferred biological sample is serum. The level of expression of the 44576 gene can be measured in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: measuring the mRNA encoded by the 44576 genes; measuring the amount of protein encoded by the 44576 genes; or measuring the activity of the protein encoded by the 44576 genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The level of mRNA corresponding to the 44576 gene in a cell can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One preferred diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length 44576 nucleic acid, such as the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO: 1, or the DNA insert of the plasmid deposited with ATCC as Accession Number ______, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 50, 100, 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to 44576 mRNA or genomic DNA. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays are described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In one format, mRNA (or cDNA) is immobilized on a surface and contacted with the probes, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative format, the probes are immobilized on a surface and the mRNA (or cDNA) is contacted with the probes, for example, in a two-dimensional gene chip array. A skilled artisan can adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoded by the 44576 genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The level of mRNA in a sample that is encoded by one of 44576 can be evaluated with nucleic acid amplification, e.g., by rtPCR (Mullis, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:189-193), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6:1197), rolling circle replication (Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques known in the art. As used herein, amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that can anneal to 5&prime; or 3&prime; regions of a gene (plus and minus strands, respectively, or vice-versa) and contain a short region in between. In general, amplification primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents, such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> For in situ methods, a cell or tissue sample can be prepared/processed and immobilized on a support, typically a glass slide, and then contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the 44576 gene being analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the methods further contacting a control sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting 44576 mRNA, or genomic DNA, and comparing the presence of 44576 mRNA or genomic DNA in the control sample with the presence of 44576 mRNA or genomic DNA in the test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods can be used to determine the level of protein encoded by 44576. In general, these methods include contacting an agent that selectively binds to the protein, such as an antibody with a sample, to evaluate the level of protein in the sample. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody bears a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal, or more preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab or F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) can be used. The term &ldquo;labeled&rdquo;, with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances are provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The detection methods can be used to detect 44576 protein in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. In vitro techniques for detection of 44576 protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunoprecipitations, immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and Western blot analysis. In vivo techniques for detection of 44576 protein include introducing into a subject a labeled anti-44576 antibody. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the methods further include contacting the control sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting 44576 protein, and comparing the presence of 44576 protein in the control sample with the presence of 44576 protein in the test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes kits for detecting the presence of 44576 in a biological sample. For example, the kit can include a compound or agent capable of detecting 44576 protein or mRNA in a biological sample; and a standard. The compound or agent can be packaged in a suitable container. The kit can further comprise instructions for using the kit to detect 44576 protein or nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> For antibody-based kits, the kit can include: (1) a first antibody (e.g., attached to a solid support) which binds to a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention; and, optionally, (2) a second, different antibody which binds to either the polypeptide or the first antibody and is conjugated to a detectable agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> For oligonucleotide-based kits, the kit can include: (1) an oligonucleotide, e.g., a detectably labeled oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the invention or (2) a pair of primers useful for amplifying a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a marker of the invention. The kit can also includes a buffering agent, a preservative, or a protein stabilizing agent. The kit can also includes components necessary for detecting the detectable agent (e.g., an enzyme or a substrate). The kit can also contain a control sample or a series of control samples which can be assayed and compared to the test sample contained. Each component of the kit can be enclosed within an individual container and all of the various containers can be within a single package, along with instructions for interpreting the results of the assays performed using the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The diagnostic methods described herein can identify subjects having, or at risk of developing, a disease or disorder associated with misexpressed or aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity. As used herein, the term &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; includes an unwanted phenomenon involved in a biological response such as pain or deregulated cell proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity is identified. A test sample is obtained from a subject and 44576 protein or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA or genomic DNA) is evaluated, wherein the level, e.g., the presence or absence, of 44576 protein or nucleic acid is diagnostic for a subject having or at risk of developing a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity. As used herein, a &ldquo;test sample&rdquo; refers to a biological sample obtained from a subject of interest, including a biological fluid (e.g., serum), cell sample, or tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The prognostic assays described herein can be used to determine whether a subject can be administered an agent (e.g., an agonist, antagonist, peptidomimetic, protein, peptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, or other drug candidate) to treat a disease or disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity. For example, such methods can be used to determine whether a subject can be effectively treated with an agent that modulates 44576 expression or activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The methods of the invention can also be used to detect genetic alterations in a 44576 gene, thereby determining if a subject with the altered gene is at risk for a disorder characterized by misregulation in 44576 protein activity or nucleic acid expression, such as a disorder associated with bone metabolism, an immune disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, a disorders involving the trachea, or a cardiovascular disorder. In preferred embodiments, the methods include detecting, in a sample from the subject, the presence or absence of a genetic alteration characterized by at least one of an alteration affecting the integrity of a gene encoding a 44576-protein, or the mis-expression of the 44576 gene. For example, such genetic alterations can be detected by ascertaining the existence of at least one of 1) a deletion of one or more nucleotides from a 44576 gene; 2) an addition of one or more nucleotides to a 44576 gene; 3) a substitution of one or more nucleotides of a 44576 gene, 4) a chromosomal rearrangement of a 44576 gene; 5) an alteration in the level of a messenger RNA transcript of a 44576 gene, 6) aberrant modification of a 44576 gene, such as of the methylation pattern of the genomic DNA, 7) the presence of a non-wild type splicing pattern of a messenger RNA transcript of a 44576 gene, 8) a non-wild type level of a 44576-protein, 9) allelic loss of a 44576 gene, and 10) inappropriate post-translational modification of a 44576-protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> An alteration can be detected without a probe/primer in a polymerase chain reaction, such as anchor PCR or RACE PCR, or, alternatively, in a ligation chain reaction (LCR), the latter of which can be particularly useful for detecting point mutations in the 44576-gene. This method can include the steps of collecting a sample of cells from a subject, isolating nucleic acid (e.g., genomic, mRNA or both) from the sample, contacting the nucleic acid sample with one or more primers which specifically hybridize to a 44576 gene under conditions such that hybridization and amplification of the 44576-gene (if present) occurs, and detecting the presence or absence of an amplification product, or detecting the size of the amplification product and comparing the length to a control sample. It is anticipated that PCR and/or LCR may be desirable to use as a preliminary amplification step in conjunction with any of the techniques used for detecting mutations described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Alternative amplification methods include: self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli, J. C. et al., (1990) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh, D. Y. et al., (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi, P. M. et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Bio</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Technology </italic></highlight>6:1197), or other nucleic acid amplification methods, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, mutations in a 44576 gene from a sample cell can be identified by detecting alterations in restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. For example, sample and control DNA is isolated, amplified (optionally), digested with one or more restriction endonucleases, and fragment length sizes are determined, e.g., by gel electrophoresis and compared. Differences in fragment length sizes between sample and control DNA indicates mutations in the sample DNA. Moreover, the use of sequence specific ribozymes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,531) can be used to score for the presence of specific mutations by development or loss of a ribozyme cleavage site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, genetic mutations in 44576 can be identified by hybridizing a sample and control nucleic acids, e.g., DNA or RNA, two dimensional arrays, e.g., chip based arrays. Such arrays include a plurality of addresses, each of which is positionally distinguishable from the other. A different probe is located at each address of the plurality. The arrays can have a high density of addresses, e.g., can contain hundreds or thousands of oligonucleotides probes (Cronin, M. T. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Human Mutation </italic></highlight>7: 244-255; Kozal, M. J. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Nature Medicine </italic></highlight>2: 753-759). For example, genetic mutations in 44576 can be identified in two dimensional arrays containing light-generated DNA probes as described in Cronin, M. T. et al. supra. Briefly, a first hybridization array of probes can be used to scan through long stretches of DNA in a sample and control to identify base changes between the sequences by making linear arrays of sequential overlapping probes. This step allows the identification of point mutations. This step is followed by a second hybridization array that allows the characterization of specific mutations by using smaller, specialized probe arrays complementary to all variants or mutations detected. Each mutation array is composed of parallel probe sets, one complementary to the wild-type gene and the other complementary to the mutant gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence the 44576 gene and detect mutations by comparing the sequence of the sample 44576 with the corresponding wild-type (control) sequence. Automated sequencing procedures can be utilized when performing the diagnostic assays ((1995) <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>19:448), including sequencing by mass spectrometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Other methods for detecting mutations in the 44576 gene include methods in which protection from cleavage agents is used to detect mismatched bases in RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA heteroduplexes (Myers et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>230:1242; Cotton et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA </italic></highlight>85:4397; Saleeba et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>217:286-295). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, the mismatch cleavage reaction employs one or more proteins that recognize mismatched base pairs in double-stranded DNA (so called &ldquo;DNA mismatch repair&rdquo; enzymes) in defined systems for detecting and mapping point mutations in 44576 cDNAs obtained from samples of cells. For example, the mutY enzyme of <highlight><italic>E. coil </italic></highlight>cleaves A at G/A mismatches and the thymidine DNA glycosylase from HeLa cells cleaves T at G/T mismatches (Hsu et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Carcinogenesis </italic></highlight>15:1657-1662; U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,039). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, alterations in electrophoretic mobility will be used to identify mutations in 44576 genes. For example, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) may be used to detect differences in electrophoretic mobility between mutant and wild type nucleic acids (Orita et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA: </italic></highlight>86:2766, see also Cotton (1993) <highlight><italic>Mutat. Res. </italic></highlight>285:125-144; and Hayashi (1992) <highlight><italic>Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. </italic></highlight>9:73-79). Single-stranded DNA fragments of sample and control 44576 nucleic acids will be denatured and allowed to renature. The secondary structure of single-stranded nucleic acids varies according to sequence, the resulting alteration in electrophoretic mobility enables the detection of even a single base change. The DNA fragments may be labeled or detected with labeled probes. The sensitivity of the assay may be enhanced by using RNA (rather than DNA), in which the secondary structure is more sensitive to a change in sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the subject method utilizes heteroduplex analysis to separate double stranded heteroduplex molecules on the basis of changes in electrophoretic mobility (Keen et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Trends Genet </italic></highlight>7:5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the movement of mutant or wild-type fragments in polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of denaturant is assayed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Myers et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>313:495). When DGGE is used as the method of analysis, DNA will be modified to insure that it does not completely denature, for example by adding a GC clamp of approximately 40 bp of high-melting GC-rich DNA by PCR. In a further embodiment, a temperature gradient is used in place of a denaturing gradient to identify differences in the mobility of control and sample DNA (Rosenbaum and Reissner (1987) <highlight><italic>Biophys Chem </italic></highlight>265:12753). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Examples of other techniques for detecting point mutations include, but are not limited to, selective oligonucleotide hybridization, selective amplification, or selective primer extension (Saiki et al. (1986) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>324:163); Saiki et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA </italic></highlight>86:6230). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, allele specific amplification technology which depends on selective PCR amplification may be used in conjunction with the instant invention. Oligonucleotides used as primers for specific amplification may carry the mutation of interest in the center of the molecule (so that amplification depends on differential hybridization) (Gibbs et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>17:2437-2448) or at the extreme 3&prime; end of one primer where, under appropriate conditions, mismatch can prevent, or reduce polymerase extension (Prossner (1993) <highlight><italic>Tibtech </italic></highlight>11:238). In addition it may be desirable to introduce a novel restriction site in the region of the mutation to create cleavage-based detection (Gasparini et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell Probes </italic></highlight>6:1). It is anticipated that in certain embodiments amplification may also be performed using Taq ligase for amplification (Barany (1991) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA </italic></highlight>88:189). In such cases, ligation will occur only if there is a perfect match at the 3&prime; end of the 5&prime; sequence making it possible to detect the presence of a known mutation at a specific site by looking for the presence or absence of amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The methods described herein may be performed, for example, by utilizing pre-packaged diagnostic kits comprising at least one probe nucleic acid or antibody reagent s described herein, which may be conveniently used, e.g., in clinical settings to diagnose patients exhibiting symptoms or family history of a disease or illness involving a 44576 gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical Compositions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid and polypeptides, fragments thereof, as well as anti-44576 antibodies (also referred to herein as &ldquo;active compounds&rdquo;) of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions typically include the nucleic acid molecule, protein, or antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language &ldquo;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&rdquo; includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL&trade; (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thinerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g. for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indeces are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The protein or polypeptide can be administered one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> For antibodies, the preferred dosage is 0.1 mg/kg of body weight (generally 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). If the antibody is to act in the brain, a dosage of 50 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg is usually appropriate. Generally, partially human antibodies and fully human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than other antibodies. Accordingly, lower dosages and less frequent administration is often possible. Modifications such as lipidation can be used to stabilize antibodies and to enhance uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain). A method for lipidation of antibodies is described by Cruikshank et al. ((1997) J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology 14:193). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> The present invention encompasses agents which modulate expression or activity. An agent may, for example, be a small molecule. For example, such small molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, peptidomimetics (e.g., peptoids), amino acids, amino acid analogs, polynucleotides, polynucleotide analogs, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, organic or inorganic compounds (i.e,. including heteroorganic and organometallic compounds) having a molecular weight less than about 10,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 5,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 1,000 grams per mole, organic or inorganic compounds having a molecular weight less than about 500 grams per mole, and salts, esters, and other pharmaceutically acceptable forms of such compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the small molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram. It is furthermore understood that appropriate doses of a small molecule depend upon the potency of the small molecule with respect to the expression or activity to be modulated. When one or more of these small molecules is to be administered to an animal (e.g., a human) in order to modulate expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid of the invention, a physician, veterinarian, or researcher may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. In addition, it is understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> An antibody (or fragment thereof) may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, alpha.-interferon, .beta.-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (&ldquo;IL-1&rdquo;), interleukin-2 (&ldquo;IL-2&rdquo;), interleukin-6 (&ldquo;IL-6&rdquo;), granulocyte macrophase colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;GM-CSF&rdquo;), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (&ldquo;G-CSF&rdquo;), or other growth factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., Chen et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Methods of Treatment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) a disorder or having a disorder associated with aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity. With regards to both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treatment, such treatments may be specifically tailored or modified, based on knowledge obtained from the field of pharmacogenomics, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention provides a method for preventing in a subject, a disease or condition associated with an aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity, by administering to the subject a 44576 or an agent which modulates 44576 expression or at least one 44576 activity. Subjects at risk for a disease which is caused or contributed to by aberrant or unwanted 44576 expression or activity can be identified by, for example, any or a combination of diagnostic or prognostic assays as described herein. Administration of a prophylactic agent can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the 44576 aberrance, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. Depending on the type of 44576 aberrance, for example, a 44576, 44576 agonist or 44576 antagonist agent can be used for treating the subject. The appropriate agent can be determined based on screening assays described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> It is possible that some 44576 disorders can be caused, at least in part, by an abnormal level of gene product, or by the presence of a gene product exhibiting abnormal activity. As such, the reduction in the level and/or activity of such gene products would bring about the amelioration of disorder symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> As discussed, successful treatment of 44576 disorders can be brought about by techniques that serve to inhibit the expression or activity of target gene products. For example, compounds, e.g., an agent identified using an assays described above, that proves to exhibit negative modulatory activity, can be used in accordance with the invention to prevent and/or ameliorate symptoms of 44576 disorders. Such molecules can include, but are not limited to peptides, phosphopeptides, small organic or inorganic molecules, or antibodies (including, for example, polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric or single chain antibodies, and FAb, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and FAb expression library fragments, scFV molecules, and epitope-binding fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Further, antisense and ribozyme molecules that inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used in accordance with the invention to reduce the level of target gene expression, thus effectively reducing the level of target gene activity. Still further, triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity. Antisense, ribozyme and triple helix molecules are discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> It is possible that the use of antisense, ribozyme, and/or triple helix molecules to reduce or inhibit mutant gene expression can also reduce or inhibit the transcription (triple helix) and/or translation (antisense, ribozyme) of mRNA produced by normal target gene alleles, such that the concentration of normal target gene product present can be lower than is necessary for a normal phenotype. In such cases, nucleic acid molecules that encode and express target gene polypeptides exhibiting normal target gene activity can be introduced into cells via gene therapy method. Alternatively, in instances in that the target gene encodes an extracellular protein, it can be preferable to co-administer normal target gene protein into the cell or tissue in order to maintain the requisite level of cellular or tissue target gene activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Another method by which nucleic acid molecules may be utilized in treating or preventing a disease characterized by 44576 expression is through the use of aptamer molecules specific for 44576 protein. Aptamers are nucleic acid molecules having a tertiary structure which permits them to specifically bind to protein ligands (see, e.g., Osborne, et al. <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem Biol. </italic></highlight>1997, 1(1): 5-9; and Patel, D. J. <highlight><italic>Curr Opin Chem Biol </italic></highlight>1997 June;1(1):32-46). Since nucleic acid molecules may in many cases be more conveniently introduced into target cells than therapeutic protein molecules may be, aptamers offer a method by which 44576 protein activity may be specifically decreased without the introduction of drugs or other molecules which may have pluripotent effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Antibodies can be generated that are both specific for target gene product and that reduce target gene product activity. Such antibodies may, therefore, by administered in instances whereby negative modulatory techniques are appropriate for the treatment of 44576 disorders. For a description of antibodies, see the Antibody section above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> In circumstances wherein injection of an animal or a human subject with a 44576 protein or epitope for stimulating antibody production is harmful to the subject, it is possible to generate an immune response against 44576 through the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies (see, for example, Herlyn, D. <highlight><italic>Ann Med </italic></highlight>1999;31(1):66-78; and Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, M., and Foon, K. A. <highlight><italic>Cancer Treat Res </italic></highlight>1998;94:51-68). If an anti-idiotypic antibody is introduced into a mammal or human subject, it should stimulate the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies, which should be specific to the 44576 protein. Vaccines directed to a disease characterized by 44576 expression may also be generated in this fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In instances where the target antigen is intracellular and whole antibodies are used, internalizing antibodies may be preferred. Lipofectin or liposomes can be used to deliver the antibody or a fragment of the Fab region that binds to the target antigen into cells. Where fragments of the antibody are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that binds to the target antigen is preferred. For example, peptides having an amino acid sequence corresponding to the Fv region of the antibody can be used. Alternatively, single chain neutralizing antibodies that bind to intracellular target antigens can also be administered. Such single chain antibodies can be administered, for example, by expressing nucleotide sequences encoding single-chain antibodies within the target cell population (see e.g., Marasco et al. (1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:7889-7893). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> The identified compounds that inhibit target gene expression, synthesis and/or activity can be administered to a patient at therapeutically effective doses to prevent, treat or ameliorate 44576 disorders. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms of the disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>/ED<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects can be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Another example of determination of effective dose for an individual is the ability to directly assay levels of &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;bound&rdquo; compound in the serum of the test subject Such assays may utilize antibody mimics and/or &ldquo;biosensors&rdquo; that have been created through molecular imprinting techniques. The compound which is able to modulate 44576 activity is used as a template, or &ldquo;imprinting molecule&rdquo;, to spatially organize polymerizable monomers prior to their polymerization with catalytic reagents. The subsequent removal of the imprinted molecule leaves a polymer matrix which contains a repeated &ldquo;negative image&rdquo; of the compound and is able to selectively rebind the molecule under biological assay conditions. A detailed review of this technique can be seen in Ansell, R. J. et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Current Opinion in Biotechnology </italic></highlight>7:89-94 and in Shea, K. J. (1994) <highlight><italic>Trends in Polymer Science </italic></highlight>2:166-173. Such &ldquo;imprinted&rdquo; affinity matrixes are amenable to ligand-binding assays, whereby the immobilized monoclonal antibody component is replaced by an appropriately imprinted matrix. An example of the use of such matrixes in this way can be seen in Vlatakis, G. et al (1993) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>361:645-647. Through the use of isotope-labeling, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; concentration of compound which modulates the expression or activity of 44576 can be readily monitored and used in calculations of IC<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>o. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Such &ldquo;imprinted&rdquo; affinity matrixes can also be designed to include fluorescent groups whose photon-emitting properties measurably change upon local and selective binding of target compound. These changes can be readily assayed in real time using appropriate fiberoptic devices, in turn allowing the dose in a test subject to be quickly optimized based on its individual IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. An rudimentary example of such a &ldquo;biosensor&rdquo; is discussed in Kriz, D. et al (1995) <highlight><italic>Analytical Chemistry </italic></highlight>67:2142-2144. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention pertains to methods of modulating 44576 expression or activity for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, the modulatory method of the invention involves contacting a cell with a 44576 or agent that modulates one or more of the activities of 44576 protein activity associated with the cell. An agent that modulates 44576 protein activity can be an agent as described herein, such as a nucleic acid or a protein, a naturally-occurring target molecule of a 44576 protein (e.g., a 44576 substrate or receptor), a 44576 antibody, a 44576 agonist or antagonist, a peptidomimetic of a 44576 agonist or antagonist, or other small molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the agent stimulates one or 44576 activities. Examples of such stimulatory agents include active 44576 protein and a nucleic acid molecule encoding 44576. In another embodiment, the agent inhibits one or more 44576 activities. Examples of such inhibitory agents include antisense 44576 nucleic acid molecules, anti-44576 antibodies, and 44576 inhibitors. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the agent to a subject). As such, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant or unwanted expression or activity of a 44576 protein or nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the method involves administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein), or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., upregulates or downregulates) 44576 expression or activity. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a 44576 protein or nucleic acid molecule as therapy to compensate for reduced, aberrant, or unwanted 44576 expression or activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Stimulation of 44576 activity is desirable in situations in which 44576 is abnormally downregulated and/or in which increased 44576 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. For example, stimulation of 44576 activity is desirable in situations in which a 44576 is downregulated and/or in which increased 44576 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect Likewise, inhibition of 44576 activity is desirable in situations in which 44576 is abnormally upregulated and/or in which decreased 44576 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> Pharmacogenomics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The 44576 molecules of the present invention, as well as agents, or modulators which have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on 44576 activity (e.g., 44576 gene expression) as identified by a screening assay described herein can be administered to individuals to treat (prophylactically or therapeutically) 44576-associated disorders associated with aberrant or unwanted 44576 activity (e.g., disorders associated with bone metabolism, immune disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, disorders involving the trachea, and/or cardiovascular disorders). In conjunction with such treatment, pharmacogenomics may be considered. &ldquo;Pharmacogenomics&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to the application of genomics technologies such as gene sequencing, statistical genetics, and gene expression analysis to drugs in clinical development and on the market. More specifically, the term refers the study of how a patient&apos;s genes determine his or her response to a drug (e.g., a patient&apos;s &ldquo;drug response phenotype&rdquo;, or &ldquo;drug response genotype&rdquo;.) Thus, another aspect of the invention provides methods for tailoring an individual&apos;s prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with either the 44576 molecules of the present invention or 44576 modulators according to that individual&apos;s drug response genotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons. See, for example, Eichelbaum, M. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. </italic></highlight>23(10-11):983-985 and Linder, M. W. et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Clin. Chem. </italic></highlight>43(2):254-266. In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated. Genetic conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body (altered drug action) or genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur either as rare genetic defects or as naturally-occurring polymorphisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Differences in metabolism of therapeutics can lead to severe toxicity or therapeutic failure by altering the relation between dose and blood concentration of the pharmacologically active drug. Thus, a physician or clinician may consider applying knowledge obtained in relevant pharmacogenomics studies in determining whether to administer a 44576 molecule or 44576 modulator as well as tailoring the dosage and/or therapeutic regimen of treatment with a 44576 molecule or 44576 modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying genes that predict drug response, known as &ldquo;a genome-wide association&rdquo;, relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome consisting of already known gene-related markers (e.g., a &ldquo;bi-allelic&rdquo; gene marker map which consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome, each of which has two variants.) Such a high-resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase II/III drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, such a high resolution map can be generated from a combination of some ten-million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a &ldquo;SNP&rdquo; is a common alteration that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process, however, the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In such a manner, treatment regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that may be common among such genetically similar individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a method termed the &ldquo;candidate gene approach&rdquo;, can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. According to this method, if a gene that encodes a drug&apos;s target is known (e.g., a 44576 protein of the present invention), all common variants of that gene can be fairly easily identified in the population and it can be determined if having one version of the gene versus another is associated with a particular drug response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a method termed the &ldquo;gene expression profiling&rdquo;, can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. For example, the gene expression of an animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a 44576 molecule or 44576 modulator of the present invention) can give an indication whether gene pathways related to toxicity have been turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Information generated from more than one of the above pharmacogenomics approaches can be used to determine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a 44576 molecule or 44576 modulator, such as a modulator identified by one of the exemplary screening assays described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides methods for identifying new agents, or combinations, that are based on identifying agents that modulate the activity of one or more of the gene products encoded by one or more of the 44576 genes of the present invention, wherein these products may be associated with resistance of the cells to a therapeutic agent Specifically, the activity of the proteins encoded by the 44576 genes of the present invention can be used as a basis for identifying agents for overcoming agent resistance. By blocking the activity of one or more of the resistance proteins, target cells, e.g., bone cells, will become sensitive to treatment with an agent that the unmodified target cells were resistant to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drugs) on the expression or activity of a 44576 protein can be applied in clinical trials. For example, the effectiveness of an agent determined by a screening assay as described herein to increase 44576 gene expression, protein levels, or upregulate 44576 activity, can be monitored in clinical trials of subjects exhibiting decreased 44576 gene expression, protein levels, or downregulated 44576 activity. Alternatively, the effectiveness of an agent determined by a screening assay to decrease 44576 gene expression, protein levels, or downregulate 44576 activity, can be monitored in clinical trials of subjects exhibiting increased 44576 gene expression, protein levels, or upregulated 44576 activity. In such clinical trials, the expression or activity of a 44576 gene, and preferably, other genes that have been implicated in, for example, a 44576-associated disorder can be used as a &ldquo;read out&rdquo; or markers of the phenotype of a particular cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a method of analyzing a plurality of capture probes. The method can be used, e.g., to analyze gene expression. The method includes: providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality, and each address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, e.g., a nucleic acid or peptide sequence; contacting the array with a 44576, preferably purified, nucleic acid, preferably purified, polypeptide, preferably purified, or antibody, and thereby evaluating the plurality of capture probes. Binding, e.g., in the case of a nucleic acid, hybridization with a capture probe at an address of the plurality, is detected, e.g., by signal generated from a label attached to the 44576 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> The capture probes can be a set of nucleic acids from a selected sample, e.g., a sample of nucleic acids derived from a control or non-stimulated tissue or cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The method can include contacting the 44576 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody with a first array having a plurality of capture probes and a second array having a different plurality of capture probes. The results of each hybridization can be compared, e.g., to analyze differences in expression between a first and second sample. The first plurality of capture probes can be from a control sample, e.g., a wild type, normal, or non-diseased, non-stimulated, sample, e.g., a biological fluid, tissue, or cell sample. The second plurality of capture probes can be from an experimental sample, e.g., a mutant type, at risk, disease-state or disorder-state, or stimulated, sample, e.g., a biological fluid, tissue, or cell sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> The plurality of capture probes can be a plurality of nucleic acid probes each of which specifically hybridizes, with an allele of 44576. Such methods can be used to diagnose a subject, e.g., to evaluate risk for a disease or disorder, to evaluate suitability of a selected treatment for a subject, to evaluate whether a subject has a disease or disorder. 44576 is associated with bone metabolism, thus it is useful for evaluating bone disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> The method can be used to detect SNPs, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a method of analyzing a plurality of probes. The method is useful, e.g., for analyzing gene expression. The method includes: providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, e.g., wherein the capture probes are from a cell or subject which express 44576 or from a cell or subject in which a 44576 mediated response has been elicited, e.g., by contact of the cell with 44576 nucleic acid or protein, or administration to the cell or subject 44576 nucleic acid or protein; contacting the array with one or more inquiry probe, wherein an inquiry probe can be a nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody (which is preferably other than 44576 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody); providing a two dimensional array having a plurality of addresses, each address of the plurality being positionally distinguishable from each other address of the plurality, and each address of the plurality having a unique capture probe, e.g., wherein the capture probes are from a cell or subject which does not express 44576 (or does not express as highly as in the case of the 44576 positive plurality of capture probes) or from a cell or subject which in which a 44576 mediated response has not been elicited (or has been elicited to a lesser extent than in the first sample); contacting the array with one or more inquiry probes (which is preferably other than a 44576 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody), and thereby evaluating the plurality of capture probes. Binding, e.g., in the case of a nucleic acid, hybridization with a capture probe at an address of the plurality, is detected, e.g., by signal generated from a label attached to the nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a method of analyzing 44576, e.g., analyzing structure, function, or relatedness to other nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. The method includes: providing a 44576 nucleic acid or amino acid sequence, e.g., a nucleotide sequence from 300-1916 or a portion thereof; comparing the 44576 sequence with one or more preferably a plurality of sequences from a collection of sequences, e.g., a nucleic acid or protein sequence database; to thereby analyze 44576. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> The method can include evaluating the sequence identity between a 44576 sequence and a database sequence. The method can be performed by accessing the database at a second site, e.g., over the internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a set of oligonucleotides, useful, e.g., for identifying SNP&apos;s, or identifying specific alleles of 44576. The set includes a plurality of oligonucleotides, each of which has a different nucleotide at an interrogation position, e.g., an SNP or the site of a mutation. In a preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides of the plurality identical in sequence with one another (except for differences in length). The oligonucleotides can be provided with diferential labels, such that an oligonucleotides which hybridizes to one allele provides a signal that is distinguishable from an oligonucleotides which hybridizes to a second allele. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> This Example describes the tissue distribution of 44576 mRNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Endogenous human 44576 gene expression was determined using the Perkin-Elmer/ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System which employs TaqMan technology. Briefly, TaqMan technology relies on standard RT-PCR with the addition of a third gene-specific oligonucleotide (referred to as a probe) which has a fluorescent dye coupled to its 5&prime; end (typically 6-FAM) and a quenching dye at the 3&prime; end (typically TAMRA). When the fluorescently tagged oligonucleotide is intact, the fluorescent signal from the 5&prime; dye is quenched. As PCR proceeds, the 5&prime; to 3&prime; nucleolytic activity of taq polymerase digest the labeled primer, producing a free nucleotide labeled with 6-FAM, which is now detected as a fluorescent signal. The PCR cycle where fluorescence is first released and detected is directly proportional to the starting amount of the gene of interest in the test sample, thus providing a way of quantitating the initial template concentration. Samples can be internally controlled by the addition of a second set of primers/probe specific for a housekeeping gene such as GAPDH which has been labeled with a different fluorophore on the 5&prime; end (typically VIC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> To determine the level of 44576 in various human tissues a primer/probe set was designed using Primer Express (Perkin-Elmer) software and primary cDNA sequence information. Total RNA was prepared from a series of human tissues using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen. First strand cDNA was prepared from one ug total RNA using an oligo dT primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL). cDNA obtained from approximately 50 ng total RNA was used per TaqMan reaction. Normal tissues tested include the human tissues provided in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, including bone cells (e.g., osteoclasts and osteoblasts), bone marrow CD71&plus; cells, fetal liver, brain, trachea, skeletal muscle, thyroid, skin, testis, breast, placenta, among others. Expression was found primarily on bone cells (e.g., osteoclasts and osteoblasts), bone marrow CD71&plus; cells, fetal liver, brain, trachea, and skeletal muscle (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> Northern blot hybridizations with various RNA samples can be performed under standard conditions and washed under stringent conditions, i.e., 0.2&times; SSC at 65&deg; C. A DNA probe corresponding to all or a portion of the 44576 cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) can be used. The DNA was radioactively labeled with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-dCTP using the Prime-It Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) according to the instructions of the supplier. Filters containing mRNA from mouse hematopoietic and endocrine tissues, and cancer cell lines (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) can be probed in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) and washed at high stringency according to manufacturer&apos;s recommendations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> In this example, 44576 is expressed as a recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion polypeptide in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the fusion polypeptide is isolated and characterized. Specifically, 44576 is fused to GST and this fusion polypeptide is expressed in E. coli, e.g., strain PEB199. Expression of the GST-44576 fusion protein in PEB199 is induced with IPTG. The recombinant fusion polypeptide is purified from crude bacterial lysates of the induced PEB 199 strain by affinity chromatography on glutathione beads. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the polypeptide purified from the bacterial lysates, the molecular weight of the resultant fusion polypeptide is determined. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Expression of Recombinant 44576 Protein in COS Cells </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> To express the 44576 gene in COS cells, the pcDNA/Amp vector by Invitrogen Corporation (San Diego, Calif.) is used. This vector contains an SV40 origin of replication, an ampicillin resistance gene, an E. coli replication origin, a CMV promoter followed by a polylinker region, and an SV40 intron and polyadenylation site. A DNA fragment encoding the entire 44576 protein and an HA tag (Wilson et al. (1984) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>37:767) or a FLAG tag fused in-frame to its 3&prime; end of the fragment is cloned into the polylinker region of the vector, thereby placing the expression of the recombinant protein under the control of the CMV promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> To construct the plasmid, the 44576 DNA sequence is amplified by PCR using two primers. The 5&prime; primer contains the restriction site of interest followed by approximately twenty nucleotides of the 44576 coding sequence starting from the initiation codon; the 3&prime; end sequence contains complementary sequences to the other restriction site of interest, a translation stop codon, the HA tag or FLAG tag and the last 20 nucleotides of the 44576 coding sequence. The PCR amplified fragment and the pCDNA/Amp vector are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and the vector is dephosphorylated using the CLAP enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). Preferably the two restriction sites chosen are different so that the 44576 gene is inserted in the correct orientation. The ligation mixture is transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cells (strains HB 101, DH5a, SURE, available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif., can be used), the transformed culture is plated on ampicillin media plates, and resistant colonies are selected. Plasmid DNA is isolated from transformants and examined by restriction analysis for the presence of the correct fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> COS cells are subsequently transfected with the 44576-pcDNA/Amp plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation methods, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. Other suitable methods for transfecting host cells can be found in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. </italic></highlight>2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. The expression of the 44576 polypeptide is detected by radiolabelling (<highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-methionine or <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-cysteine available from NEN, Boston, Mass., can be used) and immunoprecipitation (Harlow, E. and Lane, D. <highlight><italic>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988) using an HA specific monoclonal antibody. Briefly, the cells are labeled for 8 hours with <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-methionine (or <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-cysteine). The culture media are then collected and the cells are lysed using detergents (RIPA buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% DOC, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5). Both the cell lysate and the culture media are precipitated with an HA specific monoclonal antibody. Precipitated polypeptides are then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, DNA containing the 44576 coding sequence is cloned directly into the polylinker of the pCDNA/Amp vector using the appropriate restriction sites. The resulting plasmid is transfected into COS cells in the manner described above, and the expression of the 44576 polypeptide is detected by radiolabelling and immunoprecipitation using a 44576 specific monoclonal antibody. </paragraph>
