<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to retail point of sale (POS) scanning and checkout systems which enable retail cashiers to check out goods and services for purchase, while enabling customers to verify the price of products being purchased as they are being scanned, and also learn about consumer products and services offered by retailers through advertisements, productions and other forms of electronic-education delivered to consumers at a checkout counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of The State of The Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> POS-based checkout systems of the type illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are well known in the art and appear to be setting standards in the retail industry, particularly in high-volume checkout applications such as supermarkets, discount stores, superstores, and the like. Such POS-based checkout systems have either a projection-type or a bioptical laser scanner mounted in the countertop between the cashier, who stands on one side of the checkout counter, and the customer, who stands on the other side thereof during checkout operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> At the checkout system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, purchase items are automatically identified by the laser scanning bar code reader <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the cashier moves the items in the direction towards the package area where the scanned items are bagged. Automatically the price of each scanned item is displayed on a price display monitor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> typically located above the cash register terminal <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a direction facing away from the item movement direction, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Conventional checkout counter arrangements of such design render it difficult for customers to visually track scanned items with their purchased price information being displayed on the price display monitor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Visual tracking becomes even more difficult when large checkout lines are formed and the cashier is pressured to scan purchase items at the highest speeds humanly possible. In such instances, the customer is typically resigned to accept that scanned items have been properly marked with correct price information, as price verification on the display <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the customer is virtually impossible if and when the slightest distraction occurs along the checkout counter. When the customer is accompanied by children, visual price verification tends to become even more difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, conventional courtesy stands <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which straddle POS-based projection and bioptical laser scanners <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and provide support for ATM devices <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and their accompanying mag-stripe readers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, typically occupy a great deal of valuable space at the checkout counter, and generally detract from the appearance of the checkout counter where produces are purchased and sold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while most price display monitors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> above the cash register terminal are capable of displaying advertisements and promotions to the customers as they checkout their products, such monitors are not capable of performing any other functions in conventional POS-based checkout environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a great need in the art for improved POS-based bar code reading systems that are capable of satisfying the diverse requirements of modem checkout operations in physical retail environments, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art POS-based systems and methodologies. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel POS-based bar code symbol reading system having an integrated customer-kiosk terminal, and being essentially free of the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art POS-based systems and methodologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel POS-Based Bar Code Reading System With An Integrated Customer-Kiosk Terminal is installed in the countertop surface so that (i) the cashier is capable of entering product price information into the computer-based cash register system during the check-out of weighed purchase items, while (ii) the customer is able to view the price, weight and item-identity data of scanned items on the LCD panel located on the customer side of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel POS-Based Bar Code Reading System With An Integrated Internet-Enabled Customer-Kiosk Terminal, wherein a POS-Based Bioptical Laser Scanning Bar Code Reading Unit is integrated with a Cashier-Scale-Terminal/Customer-Kiosk-Terminal Module via a housing interconnection technique, and wherein the POS-based bioptical scanning unit supports a produce weigh tray having a recessed surface region for slidably receiving the full weight of produce items under gravitational loading so that the full weight of the produce items to be purchased is accurately measured by an electronic produce scale integrated within the bottom portion of the POS-based bioptical scanning unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel POS-Based Bar Code Reading System With An Integrated Internet-Enabled Customer-Kiosk Terminal, wherein its ATM submodule is removably detachable from a first installation port provided on the right side of the Cashier-Scale-Terminal/Customer-Kiosk-Terminal Module, and its voice-over-IP courtesy phone submodule is removably detachable from a second installation port provided on the left side of the Cashier-Scale-Terminal/Customer-Kiosk-Terminal Module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel POS-Based Bar Code Reading System With An Integrated Internet-Enabled Customer-Kiosk Terminal, wherein the cashier at the POS station faces the vertical scanning window of a POS-based Bioptical Laser Scanning Bar Code Reading Unit as well as a cashier-scale-terminal (with LCD panel and membrane keyboard) provided on the cashier&apos;s side of the POS-Based Laser Scanning Bar Code Reading System, while the customer faces (i) an Internet-enabled customer-Kiosk Terminal (with LCD panel and touch-screen keyboard integrated therewith) provided on the cashier&apos;s side of the system, as well as (ii) the financial transaction terminal associated with the ATM submodule, (iii) the hand-set associated with the voice-over-IP phone module, and (iv) the courtesy desk surface disposed beneath the customer-kiosk transaction terminal. </paragraph>
