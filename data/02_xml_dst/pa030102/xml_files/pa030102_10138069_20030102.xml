<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to polyhydroxy curable fluoroelastomers comprising copolymerized units of 1) ethylene, 2) a perfluoro ether such as a perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) or a perfluoro(alkyl or alkoxy alkenyl ether), 3) tetrafluoroethylene, and 4) a cure site monomer selected from the group consisting of i) 3,3,3-trifluoropropene-1, ii) trifluoroethylene, iii) 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, iv) 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, and v) 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Base resistant specialty fluoroelastomers made from copolymers of ethylene (E), a perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) (PAVE), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and a cure site monomer are known in the art (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,045). In addition to being resistant to attack by strong bases, these fluoroelastomers have good sealing properties at both low and high temperatures and exhibit low swell in oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to fully develop physical properties such as tensile strength, elongation, and compression set, elastomers must be cured, i.e. crosslinked. In the case of fluoroelastomers, this is generally accomplished by mixing uncured polymer (i.e. fluoroelastomer gum) with a polyfunctional curing agent and heating the resultant mixture, thereby promoting chemical reaction of the curing agent with active sites along the polymer backbone or side chains. Interchain linkages produced as a result of these chemical reactions cause formation of a crosslinked polymer composition having a three-dimensional network structure. Commonly used curing agents for fluoroelastomers include difunctional nucleophilic reactants, such as polyhydroxy compounds or diamines. Alternatively, peroxidic curing systems containing organic peroxides and unsaturated coagents, such as polyfunctional isocyanurates, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,045 discloses several cure site monomers which may be incorporated into E/PAVE/TFE specialty fluoroelastomers. These include brominated or iodinated alpha-olefins, and various halogenated vinyl ethers. Such fluoroelastomers may be cured with peroxides or tin compounds, but not polyhydroxy curatives. However, in many end use applications, it would be beneficial to be able to cure E/PAVE/TFE fluoroelastomers with polyhydroxy compounds because of the improved mold release properties and superior resistance to compression set (i.e. lower compression set) that is imparted by this type of crosslinking system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be particularly desirable to have an improved specialty E/PAVE/TFE fluoroelastomer that is resistant to alkaline fluids and oil swell and which readily crosslinks with polyhydroxy cure systems to form cured articles having good tensile properties and compression set resistance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has been surprisingly found that the introduction of a cure site monomer selected from the group consisting of i) 3,3,3-trifluoropropene-1, ii) trifluoroethylene, iii) 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, iv) 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, and v) 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene into ethylene/perfluoro ether/tetrafluoroethylene copolymers improves the polyhydroxy curing of these specialty fluoroelastomers without significantly diminishing the resistance of these fluoroelastomers to alkaline fluids or oil and without significantly altering the low and high temperature sealing capabilities of these fluoroelastomers.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Fluoroelastomers of this invention comprise copolymerized units of 1) ethylene (E), 2) a perfluoro ether selected from the group consisting of perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ethers) (PAVE), perfluoro(alkyl alkenyl ethers) and perfluoro(alkoxy alkenyl ethers), 3) tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and 4) a cure site monomer selected from the group consisting of i) 3,3,3-trifluoropropene-1 (TFP), ii) trifluoroethylene (TrFE), iii) 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene (1-HPFP), iv) 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene (2-HPFP), and v) 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Minor amounts (i.e. less than about 20 mole percent total) of other copolymerizable monomers may also be present in the fluoroelastomers of this invention. Examples of such monomers include, but are not limited to chlorotrifluoroethylene; vinyl fluoride; propylene; isobutene; and bromine- or iodine-containing cure site monomers such as CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;CFOCF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OCF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Br; 1-bromo-2,2-difluoroethylene; bromotrifluoroethylene; 4-bromo-3,3,4,4-tetrafluorobutene-1,4-bromo-1,1,2-trifluorobutene-1; 2-bromoperfluoro(ethyl vinyl) ether; 3-bromoperfluoro(propyl vinyl) ether; and 4-iodo-3,3,4,4-tetrafluorobutene-1. Alternatively, bromine or iodine cure sites may optionally be introduced onto the fluoroelastomer polymer chain ends by use of iodinated or brominated chain transfer agents such as methylene iodide or 1,4-diiodoperfluoro-butane during polymerization. The presence of brominated or iodinated groups permits the fluoroelastomers of this invention to be cured by organic peroxides in addition to polyhydroxy curatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Generally the fluoroelastomers of this invention contain between 10 to 40 (preferably between 20 to 40) mole percent copolymerized units of ethylene, based on the total moles of copolymerized monomers. Less ethylene adversely effects the low temperature sealing performance of the fluoroelastomers, while more ethylene adversely effects the base resistance and oil swell resistance properties of the fluoroelastomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The fluoroelastomers of this invention typically contain between 20 to 40 (preferably between 20 to 30) mole percent copolymerized units of a perfluoro ether selected from the group consisting of perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ethers), perfluoro(alkyl alkenyl ethers) and perfluoro(alkoxy alkenyl ethers), based on the total moles of copolymerized monomers. Less perfluoro ether will negatively impact the low temperature sealing performance of the fluoroelastomers of the invention, while more perfluoro ether causes the polymer to be more expensive to produce. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Perfluoro(alkyl alkenyl ethers) suitable for use as monomers include those of the formula VI</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>O(CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>CF&boxH;CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(VI)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> where R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>is a perfluorinated linear or branched aliphatic group containing 1-20, preferably 1-10, and most preferably 1-4 carbon atoms and n is an integer between 1 and 4. Specific examples include, but are not limited to perfluoro(propoxyallyl ether) and perfluoro(propoxybutenyl ether). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Perfluoro(alkoxy alkenyl ethers) differ from perfluoro(alkyl alkenyl ethers) in that R<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>in formula VI contains at least one oxygen atom in the aliphatic chain. A specific example includes, but is not limited to perfluoro(methoxyethoxyallyl ether). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also contained in the fluoroelastomers of this invention is between 32-60 (preferably 40 to 50) mole percent copolymerized units of tetrafluoroethylene, based on the total moles of copolymerized monomers. Less TFE will adversely effect oil swell resistance whereas higher levels of TFE may introduce crystallinity, thus negatively impacting elastomer properties such as elongation and compression set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The fluoroelastomers of this invention also contain 0.1 to 15 (preferably 2 to 10, most preferably 2-6) mole percent (based on the total moles of copolymerized monomers) of copolymerized units of a cure site monomer. The cure site monomer is selected from the group consisting of i) 3,3,3-trifluoropropene-1, ii) trifluoroethylene, iii) 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, iv) 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene, and v) 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is believed that during the polyhydroxy curing process, some copolymerized units of the cure site monomer, which are located adjacent to tetrafluoroethylene units in the fluoroelastomer polymer chain, dehydrofluorinate to form sites of unsaturation (i.e. C&mdash;C double bonds). These unsaturated sites are then available to react with polyhydroxy curatives to form crosslinks. Fluoroelastomers containing less than 0.1 mole percent units of one of these cure site monomers do not form a sufficient number of crosslinks to yield a cured product having desirable tensile properties for most end uses. Fluoroelastomers containing more than 15 mole percent of these cure site monomers are not desirable because i) the polymerization rate is reduced and ii) the base resistance property of the fluoroelastomer is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The fluoroelastomers of this invention are generally prepared by free radical emulsion or suspension polymerization. Preferably, the polymerizations are carried out in continuous, batch, or semi-batch emulsion processes well known in the art. The resulting fluoroelastomer latexes are usually coagulated by addition of electrolytes. The precipitated polymer is washed with water and then dried, for example in an air oven, to produce a substantially dry fluoroelastomer gum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a semi-batch emulsion polymerization process, a gaseous monomer mixture of a desired composition (initial monomer charge) is introduced into a reactor which contains an aqueous solution. Generally, the pH of the aqueous solution is controlled to between 1 and 8 (preferably 3-7), depending upon the type of fluoroelastomer being made. In addition, the initial aqueous solution may contain a nucleating agent, such as a fluoroelastomer seed polymer prepared previously, in order to promote fluoroelastomer latex particle formation and thus speed up the polymerization process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The initial monomer charge contains a quantity of TFE, E, perfluoro ether and cure site monomer. The amount of monomer mixture contained in the initial charge is set so as to result in a reactor pressure between 0.5 and 10 MPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The monomer mixture is dispersed in the aqueous medium and, optionally, a chain transfer agent may also be added at this point while the reaction mixture is agitated, typically by mechanical stirring. </paragraph>

Polymerization begins when the initiator either thermally decomposes or reacts with reducing agent and the resulting radicals react with dispersed monomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Additional quantities of the gaseous major monomers and cure site monomer (incremental feed) are added at a controlled rate throughout the polymerization in order to maintain a constant reactor pressure at a controlled temperature. The polymerization pressure is controlled in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa, preferably 1 to 6.2 MPa. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A suitable continuous emulsion polymerization process differs from the semi-batch process in the following manner. In the continuous process, gaseous monomers and solutions of other ingredients such as water-soluble monomers, chain transfer agents, buffer, bases, polymerization initiator, surfactant, etc., are fed to the reactor in separate streams at a constant rate. The temperature of the continuous process reaction mixture is maintained in the range of 25&deg; C.-130&deg; C., preferably 80&deg; C.-120&deg; C. </paragraph>

For example, the salts of bisphenol A and bisphenol AF. Specific examples include the disodium salt of bisphenol AF, the dipotassium salt of bisphenol AF, the monosodium monopotassium salt of bisphenol AF and the benzyltriphenylphosphonium salt of bisphenol AF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts of bisphenol anions and their preparation are discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,957,975 and 5,648,429. Bisphenol AF salts (1:1 molar ratio) with quaternary ammonium ions of the formula R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, wherein R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-R<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>alkyl groups and at least three of R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-R<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkyl groups are preferred. Specific examples of these preferred compositions include the 1:1 molar ratio salts of tetrapropyl ammonium-, methyltributylammonium- and tetrabutylammonium bisphenol AF. Such salts may be made by a variety of methods. For instance a methanolic solution of bisphenol AF may be mixed with a methanolic solution of a quaternary ammonium salt, the pH is then raised with sodium methoxide, causing an inorganic sodium salt to precipitate. Alternatively, a methanolic solution of bisphenol AF may first be neutralized with a molar equivalent of base (such as sodium methoxide). The quaternary ammonium salt is then added and an inorganic salt precipitates. After filtration, the tetraalkylammonium/BPAF salt may be isolated from solution by evaporation of the methanol. In another method for preparing the curative/accelerator salt, a methanolic solution of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide may be employed in place of the solution of quaternary ammonium salt, thus eliminating the precipitation of an inorganic salt and the need for its removal prior to evaporation of the methanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, derivatized polyhydroxy compounds, such as mono- or diesters and trimethylsilyl ethers, are useful crosslinking agents.

Preferably, 0.5-3.0 parts accelerator per hundred parts fluoroelastomer is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the curable compositions of the invention may contain a second curing agent in the form of a combination of an organic peroxide and a multifunctional (i.e. polyunsaturated) coagent compound. Examples of organic peroxides which are particularly effective curing agents for fluoroelastomers include dialkyl peroxides or bis(dialkyl peroxides) which decompose at a temperature above 50&deg; C. In many cases one will prefer to use a di-t-butylperoxide having a tertiary carbon atom attached to a peroxy oxygen. Among the most useful are 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexyne-3 and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butyl-peroxy)hexane. Other peroxides can be selected from such compounds as dicumyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, and di&lsqb;1,3-dimethyl-3-(t-butyl-peroxy)butyl&rsqb;carbonate. Multifunctional coagents which cooperate with such peroxides to provide curing systems include methacrylates, allyl compounds, divinyl compounds, and polybutadienes. Specific examples of coagents include one or more of the following compounds: triallyl cyanurate; triallyl isocyanurate; tris(diallylamine-s-triazine); triallyl phosphite; hexaallyl phosphoramide, N,N-diallyl acrylamide; N,N,N&prime;N&prime;-tetraallyl terephthalamide; N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetraallyl malonamide; trivinyl isocyanurate; 2,4,6-trivinylmethyltrisiloxane; and tri(5-norbornene-2-methylene)cyanurate. If a peroxide cure system is present in the compounds of the invention, the organic peroxide is generally at a level between 0.2 to 7 parts by weight (preferably 1 to 3 parts) per 100 parts fluoroelastomer and the coagent is present at a level of 0.1 to 10 (preferably 2 to 5) parts by weight per 100 parts fluoroelastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The curable composition of the invention may contain other additives, commonly used in elastomer compounding and processing. The latter may be introduced into the composition before addition of the curative, simultaneously with it, or following the addition. Typical additives include fillers, plasticizers, processing aids, antioxidants, pigments, and the like. The amount of such ingredients which is added will depend on the particular end use applications for which the cured compositions are adapted. Fillers, such as carbon black, clays, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, magnesium silicate, and fluoropolymers are generally added in amounts of from 5-100 parts by weight per 100 parts fluoroelastomer. The amount of plasticizer used is generally from 0.5-5.0 parts by weight per 100 parts fluoroelastomer. Typical plasticizers include esters, such as dioctyl phthalate and dibutyl sebacate. Processing aids are generally used in amounts of from 0.1-2.0 parts by weight per 100 parts fluoroelastomer. Suitable processing aids include octadecylamine, tetramethylene sulfone, p-chlorophenyl sulfone, and waxes, for example, carnauba wax, that aid in the processing of the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The fluoroelastomer, polyhydroxy curative, acid acceptor, accelerator and any other ingredients are generally incorporated into the curable compositions of the invention by means of an internal mixer or rubber mill. The resulting composition may then be shaped (e.g. molded or extruded) and cured. Curing typically takes place at about 150&deg;-200&deg; C. for 1 to 60 minutes. Conventional rubber curing presses, molds, extruders, and the like provided with suitable heating and curing means can be used. Also, for maximum heat resistance and dimensional stability, it is preferred to carry out a post curing operation wherein the molded or extruded article is heated in an oven or the like for an additional period of about 1-48 hours, typically at from about 180&deg;-275&deg; C., generally in an air atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The polymers of the invention and curable compositions of the invention result in cured fluoroelastomer articles which have unusually good base resistance, tensile properties and compression set resistance. Such articles find application as gaskets, seals and tubing, particularly in automotive end uses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A polymer of the invention (Polymer 1) was prepared by a continuous emulsion polymerization process, carried out at 110&deg; C. in a well-stirred 4.0-liter stainless steel liquid full reaction vessel. An aqueous solution, consisting of 2.7 g/hour (g/h) ammonium persulfate, 22.2 g/h sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, and 22.2 g/h of ammonium perfluorooctanoate, was fed to the reactor at a rate of 2 L/hour. The reactor was maintained at a liquid-full level at a pressure of 6.2 MPa by means of a backpressure control valve in the effluent line. After 30 minutes, polymerization was initiated by introduction of a gaseous monomer mixture consisting of 6.1 wt. % ethylene (E), 36.9 wt. % tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), 51.3 wt. % perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (PMVE) and 5.8 wt. % 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylene (2H-PFP) fed through a diaphragm compressor. After 2.0 hours, collection of effluent dispersion was begun and lasted for 6 hours. The effluent polymer dispersion, which had a pH of 4.4 and contained 26 wt. % solids, was separated from residual monomers in a degassing vessel at atmospheric pressure. The resulting fluoroelastomer latex was coagulated by addition of an aqueous calcium nitrate solution, filtered and then the fluoroelastomer was washed with deionized water. The wet crumb was dried in an air oven at approximately 50&deg;-65&deg; C. to a moisture content of less than 1 wt. %. About 4 kg of polymer was recovered at an overall conversion of 77.6%. The product, composed of 7.8 wt. % ethylene, 44.2 wt. % TFE, 47.0 wt. % PMVE and 1.0 wt. % 2H-PFP units, was an amorphous fluoroelastomer having a glass transition temperature of &minus;10&deg; C., as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (heating mode, 10&deg; C./minute, inflection point of transition).

A 33-liter, horizontally agitated reactor was charged with 20 liters of deionized, deoxygenated water, 200 g of ammonium perfluorooctanoate and 100 g of sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate. The reactor was heated to 80&deg; C. and then pressurized to 2.07 MPa with a mixture of 14.5 wt. % TFE, 85.3 wt. % PMVE and 0.2 wt. % 3,3,3-trifluoropropene-1 (TFP). A 35 ml sample of a 10 wt. % ammonium persulfate initiator aqueous solution was then added. A mixture of 7.7 wt. % ethylene, 42.3 wt. % TFE, 47.0 wt. % PMVE and 3.0 wt. % TFP was supplied to the reactor to maintain a pressure of 2.07 MPa throughout the polymerization. The initiator solution was fed continuously at 15 ml/hour through the end of the reaction period. After a total of 8000 g monomer mixture was supplied to the reactor, monomer addition was discontinued and the reactor was purged of residual monomer. The total reaction time was 12 hours. The resulting fluoroelastomer latex was coagulated by addition of an aqueous calcium nitrate solution, filtered and the fluoroelastomer was washed with deionized water. The polymer crumb was dried for two days at 60&deg; C. The product, composed of 7.7 wt. % ethylene, 42.3 wt. % TFE, 47.0 wt. % PMVE and 3.0 wt. % TFP, was an amorphous fluoroelastomer having a glass transition temperature of &minus;10&deg; C., as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (heating mode, 10&deg; C./minute, inflection point of transition).

The reactor was maintained at a liquid-full level at a pressure of 6.2 MPa by means of a backpressure control valve in the effluent line. After 60 minutes, polymerization was initiated by introduction of a gaseous monomer mixture consisting of 6.3 wt. % ethylene, 36.6 wt. % TFE, 55.9 wt. % PMVE and 1.2 wt. % TFP fed through a diaphragm compressor. After 4.0 hours, collection of effluent dispersion was begun and continued for 20 hours. The effluent polymer dispersion, which had a pH of 6 and contained 26 wt. % solids, was separated from residual monomers in a degassing vessel at atmospheric pressure.
