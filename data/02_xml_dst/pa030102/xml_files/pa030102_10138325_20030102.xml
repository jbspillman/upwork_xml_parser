<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition comprising at least one semi-crystalline polymer and a polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film, which can be used as a makeup or care composition for a keratin material such as the skin, the eyelashes, the eyebrows, the hair and the nails, of human beings. The invention also relates to a cosmetic makeup or care process for a keratin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The composition may be in the form of a mascara, an eyeliner, a product for the lips, a face powder, an eyeshadow, a foundation, a makeup product for the body, a concealer product, a product for the nails, an antisun composition, a skin coloring composition or a skincare product. For example, the invention relates to a mascara. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Mascara compositions in the form of a wax-in-water emulsion comprising surfactants are known from WO-A-95/15741. However, the makeup film obtained with these compositions does not always show good water resistance, and when the film comes into contact with water, for example when bathing or taking a shower, it can partially disintegrate by being worn away or by spreading around the eyes. The wearing away of the film gives rise to a substantial reduction in the intensity of the color of the makeup, thus obliging the consumer to freshen the application of the mascara. As regards the spreading of the film, this forms a very unsightly aureole around the area to which makeup has been applied. Tears and perspiration also cause these same drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To promote the water resistance of makeup, it is known practice from U.S. Pat. No. 4,423,031 to use acrylic polymers in aqueous dispersion. However, the mascara may be difficult to remove and may require the use of special makeup removers based on oils or on organic solvents. Such makeup removers may irritate the eyes, they may in particular cause stinging or they may leave a veil over the eyes, or alternatively they may leave an uncomfortable greasy residual film on the skin around the eyes (eyelids). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To avoid the use of these special makeup removers, it is possible to use soap and water, as disclosed in WO-A-96/33690, by proposing a mascara comprising a water-insoluble polymer and a water-soluble film-forming polymer. However, the use of soap may cause eye discomfort due to stinging or to the deposition of a veil over the eyes. Soap also dissolves the film of makeup, which then spreads around the eyes and forms unsightly aureoles and stains the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The use of warm water, for example water with a temperature above or equal to 35&deg; C. (temperature measured at atmospheric pressure), such as ranging from about 35&deg; C. to 50&deg; C., makes it possible to avoid at least one of the drawbacks of the makeup removers known, but the cold-water-resistant mascara compositions described previously cannot be removed with warm water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention is a cosmetic composition that can be removed with warm water while at the same time having improved cold-water resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The inventor has discovered that such a composition may be obtained using at least one film-forming polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film and at least one specific semi-crystalline polymer. After applying the composition to a keratin material, such as the eyelashes, the makeup obtained shows improved resistance to removal by cold water, that is to say to water with a temperature below or equal to 30&deg; C., for example when bathing, and/or to tears and/or to perspiration, compared to resistance to removal in the presence of warm water. The makeup is thus more easily removed with warm water, such as by rubbing with cotton wool or gauze: the makeup detaches easily from the eyelashes and can be removed from the eyelashes without fragmenting (in the form of a sheath) or in the form of fragments or pieces. The makeup thus removed does not spread on the skin, which avoids the formation of aureoles around the eyes; the skin is not stained when removing the makeup and remains clean.. The makeup is removed more simply with warm water, including warm water containing no detergent such as soaps. For the makeup removal, the warm water used may be tap water, demineralized water or mineral water brought to a temperature of greater than or equal to 35&deg; C., for example, from about 35&deg; C. to 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one first semi-crystalline polymer with a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is the use of a composition as defined above to obtain a film applied to a keratin material, the film being resistant to cold water and/or removable with warm water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the invention is a cosmetic makeup or care process for a keratin material, comprising the application of a composition as defined above to the keratin material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the invention is the use of a first semi-crystalline polymer with a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature, in a cosmetic makeup or care composition for a keratin material, to obtain a film applied to the keratin material that is resistant to cold water and/or that can be removed with warm water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is also a cosmetic process for removing makeup from a keratin material made up with a composition as defined above, comprising rinsing the said made-up keratin material at least once with warm water maintained at a temperature of greater than or equal to 35&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is a composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one first semi-crystalline polymer having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer that is capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is a mascara comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one first semi-crystalline polymer with a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is a process for making a film comprising including in a cosmetic makeup or care composition for a keratin material at least one first semi-crystalline polymer with a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C. and at least one second film-forming polymer capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature; wherein said film is applied to said keratin material and is more resistant to removal by cold water than to removal by warm water having a temperature of at least 35&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is a composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one first semi-crystalline polymer having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer that is capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature; wherein said at least one semi-crystalline polymer does not comprise a polysaccharide backbone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the invention is a composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one first semi-crystalline polymer having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., and at least one second film-forming polymer that is capable of forming a hydrophobic film at room temperature; wherein said semi-crystalline polymer is not polycaprolactone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the expression &ldquo;physiologically acceptable&rdquo; should be understood as meaning a medium that is compatible with a keratin material, such as a cosmetic medium. According to one aspect, the composition according to the invention contains little emulsifier (surfactant), or is even free of emulsifier; for example, the emulsifier is present in an amount of less than 0.5% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. The composition has good resistance to cold water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the term &ldquo;emulsifier&rdquo; means any amphiphilic compound chosen from nonionic amphiphilic compounds with an HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) of greater than or equal to 10, and ionic amphiphilic compounds whose hydrophilic portion comprises a counterion with a molar mass of greater than or equal to 50 g/mol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The makeup removal with warm water is obtained using at least one semi-crystalline polymer with a thermal transition corresponding to its melting point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Above its melting point, the semi-crystalline polymer, after its change of state, makes the film more water-sensitive: the film of makeup is made brittle on contact with warm water and by rubbing it, for example with the fingers or with a cloth or cotton wool, the film disintegrates readily or detaches from its support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The at least one semi-crystalline polymer may be present in the composition in an amount ranging from 0.1% to 30% by weight, for example from 0.5% to 25% by weight. According to another embodiment, the semi-crystalline polymer is present in an amount ranging from 1% to 20% by weight, such as from 3% to 15% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the term &ldquo;polymers&rdquo; means compounds comprising at least two repeating units, such as, at least three repeating units. According to another aspect, the compounds comprise at least ten repeating units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the expression &ldquo;semi-crystalline polymer&rdquo; means polymers comprising a crystallizable portion, crystallizable pendent chain, or crystallizable block in the skeleton, and an amorphous portion in the skeleton and having a temperature of first-order reversible phase change, for example of melting (solid-liquid transition). When the crystallizable portion is in the form of a crystallizable block of the polymer skeleton, the amorphous portion of the polymer is in the form of an amorphous block; in this case, the semi-crystalline polymer is a block copolymer, for example of the diblock, triblock or multiblock type comprising at least one crystallizable block and at least one amorphous block. The term &ldquo;block&rdquo; generally means at least five identical repeating units. The crystallizable block(s) is (are) then of different chemical nature from the amorphous block(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The semi-crystalline polymer according to the invention has a melting point of greater than or equal to 30&deg; C., for example a melting point ranging from a 30&deg; C. to 80&deg; C., According to another aspect, the melting point ranges from 30&deg; C. to 60&deg; C. This melting point is a temperature of first-order change of state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This melting point may be measured by any known method, for example by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect, the semi-crystalline polymer(s) referred to in the invention have a number-average molecular mass greater than or equal to 1,000. </paragraph>

According to another aspect, the number-average molecular mass ranges from less than 100,000, for example, from 4,000 to 99,000. According to one embodiment, they have a number-average molecular mass of greater than 5,600, for example, ranging from 5,700 to 99,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, the expression &ldquo;crystallizable chain or block&rdquo; means a chain or block which, if it was obtained alone, would change from the amorphous state to the crystalline state reversibly, depending on whether one is above or below the melting point. For the purposes of the invention, a &ldquo;chain&rdquo; is a group of atoms, which are pendent or lateral relative to the polymer skeleton. A &ldquo;block&rdquo; is a group of atoms belonging to the skeleton, this group constituting one of the repeating units of the polymer. The expression &ldquo;crystallizable chain&rdquo; means a chain containing at least six carbon atoms. </paragraph>

The semi-crystalline polymers of the invention containing crystallizable blocks are block or multiblock polymers. They may be obtained by polymerizing a monomer containing reactive (or ethylenic) double bonds or by polycondensation. When the polymers of the invention are polymers containing crystallizable side chains, these side chains are advantageously in random form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the semi-crystalline polymers of the invention are of synthetic origin. In addition, they may not comprise a polysaccharide skeleton. Generally, the crystallizable units (chains or blocks) of the semi-crystalline polymers according to the invention are derived from monomer(s) containing crystallizable block(s) or chain(s), used for the manufacture of the semi-crystalline polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a semi-crystalline polymer with a low melting point is a semi-crystalline polymer with a melting temperature of less than 50&deg; C. and a semi-crystalline polymer with a high melting point is a semi-crystalline polymer with a melting temperature at least equal to 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
