<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a passive coherent location (&ldquo;PCL&rdquo;) radar system and method, and more particularly, to a system and method for detection and feature extraction for PCL radar applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> PCL radar systems may be represented by a multistatic radar system. A multistatic radar system has many receivers that are separated from one or more transmitters. The radiated signal from a transmitter arrives at a receiver via two separate paths. One path may be a direct path from the transmitter to the receiver, and the other path may be a target path that includes an indirect path from the transmitter to a target to the receiver. Measurements may include a total path length, or transit time, of the target path signal, the angle of arrival of the target path signal, and the frequency of the direct and target path signals. A difference in frequency may be detected according to a doppler effect if the target is in motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Knowledge of the transmitted signal is desirable at the receiver if information is to be extracted from the target path signal. The transmitted frequency is desired to determine the doppler frequency shift. A time or phase reference also is desired if the total scattered path length is to be determined. The frequency reference may be obtained from the direct signal. The time reference also may be obtained from the direct signal provided the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Multistatic radar systems may be capable of determining the presence of a target within the coverage of the radar, the location of the target position, and a velocity component, or doppler, relative to the radar. The process of locating the target position may include a measurement of a distance and the angle of arrival. The measurement determination of distance relative to the receiving site may require both the angle of arrival at the receiving site and the distance between transmitter and receiver. If the direct signal is available, it may be used as a reference signal to extract the doppler frequency shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In PCL radar systems, transmitters may be known as illuminators. Illuminators may be wideband sources of opportunities that include commercial frequency modulated (&ldquo;FM&rdquo;) broadcast transmitters and/or repeaters, commercial high-definition television (&ldquo;HDTV&rdquo;) broadcast transmitters and/or repeaters, and the like. Known techniques for wideband signal pre-detection processing and co-channel interference mitigation exist. Known approaches include an array of antennas used to receive the source of opportunity to be exploited, such as the primary illuminator, and any other co-channel signals present in the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> After the received signals have been processed, target parameters should be extracted and new targets detected. Existing targets may be updated with the data for the current processing interval. The detection and feature extraction of target information should be performed in an accurate and timely manner. Incorrect or invalid detections may waste processing resources and require additional computing. Further, a system should detect new targets without false alarms from noise or ground clutter. Thus, a PCL radar system should be able to detect targets and extract features of those targets in an efficient and accurate manner </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of a radar system, a target and transmitters in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Radar detection system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for detecting one or more targets of interest <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, using a plurality of transmitters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> represents a family of multi-static wide area target surveillance sensors. PCL <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> system exploits continuous wave (&ldquo;CW&rdquo;) electromagnetic energy, often from sources of opportunity that may be operating for other purposes. Sources of opportunity may include television broadcast stations and FM radio stations. Preferably, PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may receive transmissions from a plurality of uncontrolled transmitters, also known as sources of opportunity, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. More preferably transmitters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be wideband sources of opportunity that include commercial FM broadcast transmitters and/or repeaters and commercial HDTV TV broadcast transmitters and/or repeaters. Transmitters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, however, are not limited to these sources of opportunity and may include any device, system or means to transmit uncontrolled signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Transmitters <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may transmit wideband electromagnetic energy transmissions in all directions. Some of these transmissions are reflected by one or more targets of interest <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and received by PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, reflected transmission <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be reflected by target <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and received by PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, with regard to transmitter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, reference transmission <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is received directly by PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may compare reference transmission <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and reflected transmission <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to determine positional information about one or more targets of interest <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Reference transmission <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> also may be known as a direct path signal. Reflected transmission <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also may be known as a target path signal. Positional information may include any information relating to a position of target <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, including location, velocity, and acceleration from determining a time difference of arrival (&ldquo;TDOA&rdquo;), a frequency difference of arrival (&ldquo;FDOA&rdquo;) and an angle of arrival (&ldquo;AOA&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of a passive coherent location system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include antenna subsystem <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, analog to digital converter (&ldquo;ADC&rdquo;) subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, processing subsystem <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and output device <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Antenna subsystem <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives electromagnetic energy transmissions, including reflected transmission <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and reference transmission <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with at least one antenna. ADC subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> receives the signal outputs of antenna subsystem <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and outputs digital samples of the signals at its input by sampling the signals at a sampling rate and forming a digital waveform using the magnitude for the analog signal at each sampling interval. Processing subsystem <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> receives the output of assembly subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and processes the signals for measurement data, tracking, target updates, and the like. Output device <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> receives the processing result and displays the output of processing subsystem <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of a detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Detection feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into processing subsystem <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Alternatively, detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be incorporated in ADC subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is responsible for providing detection data used in measurement association operations. Detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> receives ambiguity surface data for each ambiguity surface. The ambiguity surface data may be smoothed by a simple smoothing function. Each cross-ambiguity surface may be scanned for bins that represent targets, or residual ground clutter. The bins may be associated across targeting beams or surfaces to form the peak detections for the current update. Target measurement parameters of delay, doppler, angle of arrival, signal power, and signal to noise ratio (&ldquo;SNR&rdquo;) for each peak detection are estimated from the peak&apos;s location and the associated energy. Further, the variances of the delay, doppler, angle of arrival, and signal power may be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each processing cycle may begin with an ambiguity function data block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> being input to detection and feature extraction processing sub-system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> from pre-detection operations. Ambiguity function data block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may contain ambiguity surface data. Ambiguity surface data may be an ambiguity diagram that represents the response of a matched filter to a signal as well as mismatched signals. The output of the matched filter, or the ambiguity diagram, may proximate a cross-correlation between a received signal and a transmitted signal. Thus, the ambiguity diagram may have peaks that correlate to target detections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is input to ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> prepares each ambiguity function for subsequent detection processing operations. Thus, ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is received for each cycle and ambiguity function formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> prepares the data for that cycle. These cycles may be known as coherent processing intervals (&ldquo;CPIs&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Ambiguity surface smoothing function <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> reduces irregularities in the cross-ambiguity surfaces prior to discrimination of target peaks from background noise of cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> outputs the smoothed ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Three alternatives may be implemented for ambiguity surface smoothing. A simple smoothing function averages N&times;N adjacent points to smooth the raw ambiguity surface produced by ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. A conventional ambiguity surface smoothing function may be accomplished by the application of a two-dimensional filter kernel to the raw ambiguity surface of cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. A fast convolution smoothing function also may be applied of a two-dimensional filter kernel to the raw ambiguity surface, but may be applied directly to the decimated lag-products from pre-detection processing, thereby avoiding the need to form raw ambiguity functions in pre-detection processing. Fast convolution smoothing function may provide computational savings over the other ambiguity surface smoothing processes. Ambiguity surface smoothing function <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may be enabled by smoothing switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Thus, if detection and feature extraction processing sub-system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> desires to reduce irregularities in cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, the smoothing switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is configured to enable ambiguity surface smoothing function <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> then is received by peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> identifies those bins within cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> that are likely to have been produced by a target echo, or by residual ground clutter. An algorithm may be implemented by peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> that is predicated on the conclusion that the bins identified by peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for the previous ambiguity surface update may be a reasonable initial guess for the set of bins for the current update. Thus, the algorithm may compare the previous ambiguity surface data with the current ambiguity surface data. All of the bins associated with known targets or residual ground clutter maybe revisited with the current ambiguity surface data, such as cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. After the comparison, cross-ambiguity surface data <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be examined for new target echoes. An estimate of the noise floor may be produced based upon the average power in these remaining bins. Using this information, peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may detect surface peaks <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Surface peaks <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> are received by peak association function <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Peak association function <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may group bins identified by the peak/noise discrimination function <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> into discrete peaks. These discrete peaks may be known as peak detections, such as peak detections <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>. Parameter estimation function <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> receives peak detections <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> to estimate the primary target parameters from the detected peaks. Primary target parameters may include signal-to-noise ratio, time delay, doppler shift, angle of arrival, signal power, and the like. Parameter estimation function <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> also may perform feature extraction on the detected peaks of peak detections <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>. Feature extractions may derive more advanced targeted parameters, such as blade rates, bi-static radar cross sections, and the like. Thus, parameter estimation function <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> calculates the peak measurements <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. Peak measurements <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> are received by peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may reduce the number of detected peaks that cause false alarms and are not the result of target echoes. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is disclosed in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> also receives target state feedback <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. Target state feedback <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> may be derived from ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> also receives auto-ambiguity peaks <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> from auto-ambiguity peak finding function <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Auto-ambiguity peak finding function <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> receives surface data <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> from ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Auto-ambiguity peak finding function <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may scan surface data <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> for peaks that match criteria that indicate modulation artifacts for higher signal-to-noise ratio peaks within surface data <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>. This operation may characterize sidelobes of peaks within ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Auto-ambiguity data <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> are forwarded to peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> for sidelobe processing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Initial variance calculation function <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may define a variance for each target parameter that can be used in a subsequent line tracking function that receives detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight>. Detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> is the output of detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. A line tracking function may use these variances to update its Kalman filter state vectors. The measurement variance calculations used for the implementation may be based on the Cramer-Rao boundary. Configuration data <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may provide system configuration or technical information regarding PCL radar system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> used with detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Further, configuration data <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may provide default values or constant values for the algorithms implemented by the various functions within detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Strong target cancellation function <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> may receive target state data <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> from ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Strong target cancellation function <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> also may receive target state feedback <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. A strong target cancellation switch <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> enables the strong target cancellation function <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, if desired. Preferably, strong target cancellation switch <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> activates strong target cancellation function <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. If ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes strong target data, then the strong target data may canceled and the ambiguity surface formation function <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. A strong target may indicate a detected peak that skews other peaks within ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. By canceling the strong target, the other peaks and data with an ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be analyzed in a more efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> is the output of detection and feature extraction processing subsystem <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> may be a data block of new peak detections for the current update. The data block may include the number of peak detections for each illuminator, the number of bins processed for each illuminator, the associated time of the current update, current frequencies for each illuminator, the average root-mean-squared bandwidth of the reference signal for each illuminator, the system noise figure for each illuminator, the measurement data associated with each peak detection, and the like. This data may be used by a subsequent line tracking function to update target estimation state. Individual peak detections of detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> may contain measurement data that is used for these updates. The measurement data depicted in Table 1 below is an example of the perimeters included for each individual peak detection.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram for a peak editing function in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is depicted in greater detail to better disclose embodiments of the present invention. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, however, is not limited to the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As noted above, peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may reduce the number of detected peaks that may cause false alarms and are not the result of target echoes within peak measurement data <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. Peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may comprise several functions and filters that accomplish this task. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts an overview of the filters and functions that comprise peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Poor reference signal characteristics, signal modulation artifacts, and residual ground clutter may result in unwanted detection peaks. The function and filters disclosed below may be enabled to prevent these detections from being processed further. Peak measurement data <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> is received at peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Peak measurement data <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> may include primary target parameters from detected peaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Root-mean-squared bandwidth defined peak detection exclusion function <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be enabled by root-mean-squared bandwidth switch <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In order to prevent false peaks due to bad cross-correlations when the reference signals bandwidth collapses, root-mean-squared bandwidth switch <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is enabled in the detection processing to disregard the current peak detection if the realized bandwidth associated with that peak detection falls below a threshold. This threshold may be defined by root-mean-squared bandwidth defined peak detection exclusion function <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Sidelobe peak detection filter <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be enabled by sidelobe filter switch <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Sidelobe peak detection filter <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may remove detected peaks that are modulation artifacts of a higher SNR ratio. The peak detections from the cross-ambiguity surfaces and the peaks found by the auto-ambiguity peak finding function <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> or the current processing interval update may be sorted from the strongest to weakest at the entry of sidelode peak detection filter <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. By being sorted from strongest to weakest, weaker sidelobe peaks may be removed by sidelobe filter switch <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> if enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Close-in target thresholding function <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be enabled by close-in target switch <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. If enabled, a threshold ramp may be used to desensitize the detector to close-in targets. Due to reduced propagation losses, a close-in target may have a higher signal-to-noise ratio that triggers high sidelobes that may be interpreted by the detector as peaks. The desensitization is implemented as an adaptive threshold based upon a peak&apos;s time delay measurement. Thus, close-in target thresholding function <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may remove all sidelobes that are a result of close-in targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Blade modulation induced peak editor <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be enabled by blade modulation editor switch <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. Blade modulation induced peak editor <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be enabled in order to prevent peak detections that are replicated in doppler space due to aircraft blade modulation effects. If an aircraft has rotors, the rotors may cause blade doppler shifts in addition to any doppler shifts from the aircraft. Blade modulation induced peak editor <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be enabled if the PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is being used in conjunction with aircraft detection operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Peak detection zero-doppler exclusion function <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may be enabled by the zero-doppler exclusion switch <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Peak detection zero-doppler exclusion function <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may be enabled in order to prevent detections that are distorted due to zero-doppler cancellation effects from associating with existing line tracks. A zero-doppler exclusion zone may be defined for peak detection promotion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The data used by the peak editing functions and filters may be calculated in pre-detector processing operations. For example, zero-doppler cancellation and root-mean-squared bandwidth calculations may be performed during wideband processing operations, and those valves used here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Peak limiting function <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may bound the final number of peaks promoted by the functions disclosed with reference to peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The peaks are promoted to the tracking algorithms for further processing. The peaks with largest signal- to-noise ratios may be the ones that form the peak detection block output, or detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight>. Filtered peak data <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may be included within detection data <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight>. Thus, peak editing function <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> filters peak detections to remove detections caused by sidelobes, close-in targets, and blade modulations effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts a flowchart for detecting and extracting features for PCL operations in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> executes by smoothing ambiguity surface data. If configured, the ambiguity smoothing surface may be smoothed by a simple N&times;N smoothing function. The above disclosed alternatives for implementing the ambiguity surface smoothing function may be used. Irregularities may be reduced in the ambiguity surface data prior to detecting and extracting targets peaks from background noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> executes by scanning the bins that represent targets or residual ground clutter. Each cross-ambiguity surface may be scanned with these bins. A peak-noise discrimination output may be implemented to scan the surface data for those bins that are likely to have been produced by target echoes. Step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> executes by associating the bins across the target beams or surfaces to form the peak detections for the current update. For example, the ambiguity function data that spawns the ambiguity surface data may be received by during the discrete updates. This data is analyzed and scanned to determine peak detections as a result of target echoes. The bins identified in step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> may be grouped into discrete peaks to form peak detections. Step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> executes by estimating target measurement parameters for the peak detections. Target measurement parameters of delay, doppler, angle of arrival, signal power, and signal-to-noise ratio, and the like, for each peak detection may be estimated from the peak&apos;s location and energy. Further, the variances of the delay, doppler, angle of arrival, and signal power, and the like may be estimated from the detection peaks. Step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> executes by editing the detected peaks to reduce the number of detected peaks that may cause false alarms and may not be a result of a target echo. Filters and functions may be enabled to prevent these false peak detections from being processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a flowchart for detecting and extracting features from ambiguity function data in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> executes by inputting ambiguity function data. For example, ambiguity function data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be input to detection and feature extraction processing sub-system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> executes by forming an ambiguity surface having surface data cross-ambiguity surface data. Further, step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may cancel strong target data from the ambiguity surface data. Step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> executes by smoothing the ambiguity surface data to reduce irregularities prior to discrimination of target peaks from background noise. As noted above, three alternatives for ambiguity surface smoothing may be implemented. Once the ambiguity surface data has been smoothed, step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> executes by discriminating target peaks from noise. The bins identified by a peak/noise discrimination function with a previous ambiguity surface update may be an initialized for the current update. Thus, previous peak detections may be compared to the current ambiguity surface data to update target echo detections. Step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> executes by identifying bins that were comparable to previous ambiguity surface updates in step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Once all of the bins associated with known targets or residual ground clutter have been reexamined, the ambiguity surface is examined for new target echoes. Further, an estimate of the noise formula may be produced based on the average power in the remaining bins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> executes by grouping bins into discrete peaks. These bins may be identifiable by the peak/noise discrimination operations of step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> executes by estimating the primary target perimeters from the detected peaks. The primary targets may include signal-to-noise ratio, time delay, doppler, angle of arrival, signal power, and the like. Step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> executes by deriving the advanced target perimeters with the detected peaks. Advanced target perimeters may include blade rates, bi-static radar cross-sections, and the like. The advanced target perimeters correlate to the primary target perimeters for the detected peaks. The primary target perimeters and the advanced target perimeters may be used by line tracking functions within PCL system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> executes by scanning the auto-ambiguity surface data that is formed within step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. By scanning the auto-ambiguity surface data, auto-ambiguity peaks may be detected. Step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> executes by editing the detected peaks using the auto-ambiguity peaks from step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> as well as target parameter data from step <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>. The detected peaks are edited to reduce the number of peaks that may cause false alarms and are not the result of a target echo. Filtered operations and other discrimination functions may be enabled to prevent bogus peak detections from being processed further. Step <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> executes by calculating target parameter variance. A variance for each target parameter may be defined to be used in later line tracking functions. Step <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> executes by generating detection data to be output for further processing. Preferably, the detection data is output to a line tracking function to associate peak measurement data with existing target detections, or to generate new target detection data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts a flowchart for discriminating peaks from noise in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> may correlate the steps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Steps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, however of, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are not limited by the disclosed steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> executes by identifying bins from a previous ambiguity surface. The previous ambiguity surface may be an update prior in time to the current update. Step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> executes by associating previous bins within the previous ambiguity surface with the current bins of the current ambiguity surface. Previous bins may be used as initial guesses for the set of bins within the current ambiguity surface update. Step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> executes by examining the ambiguity surface for new target echoes. Peaks that were not correlated to previous ambiguity surface updates may be used in calculating target perimeters for newly detected targets. Step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> executes by identifying the new bins according to the detected peaks. Step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> executes by estimating those four based upon the average power in the remaining bins not associated with a target echo of residual ground clutter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the disclosed embodiments of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention embody the modifications and variations of this invention provided that they come within the scope of any claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
