<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods for preventing or inhibiting cell death, and to methods of treating conditions that require prevention, inhibition, and/or amelioration of cell death and tissue necrosis. The invention encompasses administering an antibody or antibodies, antibody derivative(s) or antibody fragment(s) that bind to neural thread proteins (NTP) to a mammal experiencing cell death as a result of the presence of NTP. The antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment can be administered intramuscularly, orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intracerebrally (intraparenchymally), intracerebroventricularly, intratumorally, intralesionally, intradermally, intrathecally, intranasally, intraocularly, intraarterially, topically, transdermally, via an aerosol, infusion, bolus injection, implantation device, sustained release system etc., either alone or conjugated to a carrier. Alternatively, the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment can be expressed in vivo by administering a gene that expresses the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment or a vaccine that induces antibody production or by introducing cells, bacteria or viruses that express the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment in vivo, either because of genetic modification or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairments in memory, behavior, language, and visuo-spatial skills, ending ultimately in death. Hallmark pathologies within vulnerable regions include extracellular &bgr;-amyloid deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, and extensive neuronal cell death. Research on the causes and treatments of Alzheimer&apos;s disease has led investigators down numerous avenues. Considerable evidence has implicated alterations in production or processing of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the etiology of the disease. However, intensive research has proven that AD is a multifactorial disease with many different, perhaps overlapping, etiologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because of this, those in the field have conducted significant research and clinical investigations to study the structural deficiencies, chemical changes, and functional abnormalities both within the brain and within different populations of nerve cells. The depth of such investigations and studies are represented by the following publications, which represent only a handful of the vast reports in this arena: <highlight><italic>Neurobiology ofAlzheimer&apos;s </italic></highlight>Disease (D.

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To date, Alzheimer&apos;s disease is the third most expensive disease in the United States, costing society approximately $100 billion each year. It is one of the most prevalent illnesses in the elderly population, and with the aging of society, will become even more significant. Costs associated with AD include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost patient and care giver productivity. Medical treatment and behavior modification may have economic benefits by slowing the rate of cognitive decline, delaying institutionalization, reducing care giver hours, and improving quality of life. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown positive results regarding the effect of drug therapy and behavior modification on nursing home placement, cognition, and care giver time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Neural thread proteins (NTP) are a family of recently characterized brain proteins. One member of this family, AD7C-NTP, is a &tilde;41 kD membrane associated phosphoprotein with functions related to neuritic sprouting (de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest., </italic></highlight>100:3093-3104 (1997); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Alz. Rep., </italic></highlight>2:327-332 (1999); de la Monte SM and Wands JR, <highlight><italic>Journal of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease, </italic></highlight>3:345-353 (2001)). The gene that encodes AD7C-NTP and predicted protein sequence for AD7C-NTP has been identified and described (de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest., </italic></highlight>100:3093-3104 (1997)). In addition to the &tilde;41 kD species, other species of neural thread protein (&tilde;26 kD, &tilde;21 kD, &tilde;17 kD, and &tilde;15 kD) have been identified and associated with neuroectodermal tumors, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas and with injury due to hypoxia, schema, or cerebral infarction (Xu et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>53:3823-3829 (1993); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., </italic></highlight>55(10):1038-50 (1996), de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci., </italic></highlight>138(1-2):26-35 (1996); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci., </italic></highlight>135(2):118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest., </italic></highlight>100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Alz. Rep., </italic></highlight>2:327-332 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Species of neural thread protein have been described and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634; 5,948,888; and 5,830,670, all for &ldquo;Neural Thread Protein Gene Expression and Detection of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease&rdquo; and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,705 for &ldquo;Method of Detecting Neurological Disease or Dysfunction.&rdquo; The methods and specifications of these patents are specifically incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As described therein, NTP is upregulated and produced during cell death. Thus, dead and dying nerve cells are described as overproducing NTP, and accordingly, its presence indicates the death of nerve cells and the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other species of neural thread protein have been identified as other products of the AD7c-NTP gene (e.g. a 112 amino acid protein described in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession &num;XP<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>032307 PID gl5928971) or as being similar to neural thread proteins (e.g. a 106 amino acid protein described in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession &num;AAH14951 PID gl5928971, another 106 amino acid protein described in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession &num;XP<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>039102 PID gl8599339 and a 61 amino acid protein described in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession &num;AAH02534 PID gl2803421). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is compelling evidence linking the AD7C-NTP specie of neural thread protein in particular with AD and it is upregulated during cell death in AD. AD7C-NTP MRNA is upregulated in AD brain compared to controls; AD7C-NTP protein levels in brain and in CSF are higher in AD than controls; and AD7C-NTP immunoreactivity is found in senile plaques, in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), in degenerating neurons, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neurotic sprouts in AD and Down syndrome brains (Ozturk et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>86:419-423 (1989); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest., </italic></highlight>86(3): 1004-13 (1990); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci., </italic></highlight>113(2):152-64 (1992); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Neurol., </italic></highlight>32(6):733-42 (1992); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., </italic></highlight>55(10):1038-50 (1996), de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci., </italic></highlight>138(1-2):26-35 (1996); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci., </italic></highlight>135(2):118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest., </italic></highlight>100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Alz. Rep., </italic></highlight>2:327-332 (1999)). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the AD7C-NTP protein is localized within cells, within fine processes within the neuropil, or is extracellular in both AD and Down&apos;s Syndrome brains. de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Neurol., </italic></highlight>32(6):733-42 (1992). Two types of cells contain NTP: neurons and astrocytes (Id.). The affected neurons are the large pyramidal type that typically contain the neurofibrillary tangles well known in AD brain (Id.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Elevated levels of AD7C-NTP protein have been found in both CSF and urine of AD patients, showing its accuracy as a biochemical marker for this devastating illness (de la Monte and Wands, <highlight><italic>Front Biosci </italic></highlight>7: 989-96 (2002); de la Monte and Wands, <highlight><italic>Journal of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease </italic></highlight>3: 345-353 (2001); Munzar et al, <highlight><italic>Alzheimer&apos;s Reports </italic></highlight>4: 61-65 (2001); Kahle et al, <highlight><italic>Neurology </italic></highlight>54: 1498-1504 (2000) and Averback <highlight><italic>Neurology </italic></highlight>55: 1068 (2000); Munzar et al, <highlight><italic>Alzheimer Reports </italic></highlight>3: 155-159 (2000); de la Monte et al, <highlight><italic>Alzheimer&apos;s Reports </italic></highlight>2: 327-332 (1999); Ghanbari et al, <highlight><italic>J Clin Lab Anal </italic></highlight>12: 285-288 (1998); Ghanbari et al, <highlight><italic>J Clin Lab Anal </italic></highlight>12: 223-226 (1998); Ghanbari et al, <highlight><italic>Journal of Contemporary Neurology </italic></highlight>1998; 4A: 2-6 (1998); and de la Monte et al, <highlight><italic>J Clin Invest </italic></highlight>100: 3093-3104 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Over-expression of the AD7C-NTP gene also has been linked to the process of cell death in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (de la Monte and Wands, <highlight><italic>J. Neuropatho. and Exp. Neuro., </italic></highlight>60:195-207 (2001); de la Monte and Wands, <highlight><italic>Cell Mol Life Sci </italic></highlight>58: 844-49 (2001). AD7C-NTP has also been identified in Down&apos;s Syndrome brain tissue (Wands et al., International Patent Publication No. WO 90/06993; de la Monte et al, <highlight><italic>J Neurol Sci </italic></highlight>135: 118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Alz. Rep., </italic></highlight>2:327-332 (1999)). There is some evidence that over-expression of the AD7c-NTP gene may also be associated with glaucoma (Golubnitschaja-Labudova et al, <highlight><italic>Curr Eye Res </italic></highlight>21: 867-76 (2000)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present inventor recently discovered that released AD7C-NTP protein was cytotoxic and capable of causing cell death to other cells in tissue (as compared with up-regulated AD7C-NTP produced by the dying cell itself), as disclosed in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ and entitled &ldquo;Methods of Treating Tumors and Related Conditions Using Neural Thread Proteins,&rdquo; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Accordingly, it would be desirable to prevent, inhibit, modulate or ameliorate cell death and tissue necrosis associated with neural thread proteins, especially in AD brain. </paragraph>

Nos. 5,948,634, 5,948,888, and 5,830,670 and in NCBI Entrez-Protein database Accession &num;AF010144. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; refers antibodies that are capable of binding to or recognizing NTP and includes both monoclonal antibodies, which are a substantially homogeneous population, and polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous populations. Polyclonal antibodies are derived from the sera of animals immunized with an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to specific antigens may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kohler and Milstein, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>256:495-497 (1975) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 2. antibodies produced by a hybridoma selected from HB 9934, HB 9935, and HB 9936, all of which are deposited at the American Type Culture Collection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> 3. antibodies against neural thread proteins as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,670, 5,948,634 and 5,948,888, including (but not limited to) mAbs Th7, Th9, Th10, Th29 and Th34 and mABs &num;2 and &num;5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 4. antibodies against a neurological form of pancreatic thread protein as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,705, including (but not limited to) mAbs 7, 9 and 10 as described therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; as it is used herein also includes biologically active variants, homologs, peptide mimetics, reverse-D peptides, and enantiomers of an antibody to NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Structurally, the simplest antibody (IgG) comprises four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulphide bonds. The light chains exist in two distinct forms called kappa (&kgr;) and lambda (&lgr;). Each chain has a constant region (C) and a variable region (V). Each chain is organized into a series of domains. The light chains have two domains, corresponding to the C region and the other to the V region. The heavy chains have four domains, one corresponding to the V region and three domains (1, 2 and 3) in the C region. The antibody has two arms (each arm being a Fab region), each of which has a VL and a VH region associated with each other. It is this pair of V regions (VL and VH) that differ from one antibody to another (owing to amino acid sequence variations), and which together are responsible for recognizing the antigen and providing an antigen binding site (ABS). In even more detail, each V region is made up from three complementarity determining regions (CDR) separated by four framework regions (FR). The CDR&apos;s are the most variable part of the variable regions, and they perform critical antigen binding function. The CDR regions are derived from many potential germ line sequences via a complex process involving recombination, mutation and selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibody fragment&rdquo; as it is used herein refers to a biologically active fragment of an antibody to NTP and includes (i) the Fab fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains of the antibody; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (iv) the dab fragment (Ward, E. S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989) which consists of a VH domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulphide bridge at the hinge region; and (vii) single chain Fv (scFv) where the two domains of the Fv fragment, coded for by separate genes, are joined by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain (known as Bird, R. E. et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>242, 423-426 (1988) Huston, J. S. et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </italic></highlight>85, 5879-5883 (1988)) by recombinant methods. Fab, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, scFv and other such fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation, and may have less non-specific tissue binding than an intact antibody (Wahl et al., <highlight><italic>J. Nucl. Med. </italic></highlight>24:316-325 (1983)). In addition, the Fab, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, scFv and other such fragments may be small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier without the need for extraneous treatment of the barrier, or conjugation to barrier-penetrating conjugates, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that Fab, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, scFv and other fragments of the antibodies useful in the present invention may be used for preventing, inhibiting, and/or ameliorating cell death and/or tissue necrosis in live tissue containing NTP in the same manner as an intact antibody may be used. Such fragments typically are produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments) or by recombinant methods (to produce scFv fragments). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibody fragment&rdquo; as it is used herein also includes biologically active variants, homologs, peptide mimetics, reverse-D peptides, and enantiomers of antibody fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibody derivative&rdquo; refers to biologically active derivatives of antibodies to NTP and antibody fragments and includes derivatives of antibodies and antibody fragments produced by means of phage display technologies or bacterial or yeast cell surface display technologies. The term &ldquo;antibody derivative&rdquo; also includes humanized antibodies and antibody fragments and also includes biologically active variants, homologs, peptide mimetics, reverse-D peptides, and enantiomers of a biologically active antibody derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;biologically active&rdquo; refers to an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that has the ability of recognizing and/or binding to NTP and includes (but is not limited to) the ability to prevent, inhibit, reduce, control or ameliorate cell death and/or tissue necrosis caused by the presence of NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> An antibody is said to have &ldquo;the ability of binding,&rdquo; be &ldquo;capable of binding,&rdquo; &ldquo;binds to&rdquo; or &ldquo;recognizes&rdquo; a molecule (e.g., a protein such as NTP) if it is capable of specifically reacting with the molecule to thereby bind the molecule to the antibody. The term &ldquo;epitope&rdquo; is meant to refer to that portion of any molecule capable of being bound by an antibody that can also be recognized by that antibody. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;antigen&rdquo; is a molecule capable of being bound by an antibody that is additionally capable of inducing an animal to produce antibody capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one, or more than one epitope. The specific reaction referred to above is meant to indicate that the antigen will react, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding antibody and not with the multitude of other antibodies that may be evoked by other antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; refers to a protein or polypeptide that consists of a continuous subsequence of the amino acid sequence of a NTP protein or of an antibody, antibody fragment or antibody derivative and includes naturally occurring fragments such as splice variants and fragments resulting from naturally occurring in vivo protease activity. Such a fragment may be truncated at the amino terminus, the carboxy terminus, and/or internally (such as by natural splicing). Such fragments may be prepared with or without an amino terminal methionine. The term &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; includes fragments, whether identical or different, from the same NTP protein or antibody or antibody derivative with a contiguous amino acid sequence in common or not, joined together, either directly or through a linker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;variant&rdquo; refers to a protein or polypeptide in which one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions are present as compared to the amino acid sequence of an NTP protein or antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment and includes naturally occurring allelic variants or alternative splice variants of an NTP protein or antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment. The term &ldquo;variant&rdquo; includes the replacement of one or more amino acids in a peptide sequence with a similar or homologous amino acid(s) or a dissimilar amino acid(s). There are many scales on which amino acids can be ranked as similar or homologous. (Gunnar von Heijne, <highlight><italic>Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, p. 123-39 (Academic Press, New York, N.Y. 1987.) Preferred variants include alanine substitutions at one or more of amino acid positions. Other preferred substitutions include conservative substitutions that have little or no effect on the overall net charge, polarity, or hydrophobicity of the protein. Conservative substitutions are set forth in Table I below.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Other variants can consist of less conservative amino acid substitutions, such as selecting residues that differ more significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. The substitutions that in general are expected to have a more significant effect on function are those in which (a) glycine and/or proline is substituted by another amino acid or is deleted or inserted; (b) a hydrophilic residue, e.g., seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g., leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl, or alanyl; (c) a cysteine residue is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (d) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysyl, arginyl, or histidyl, is substituted for (or by) a residue having an electronegative charge, e.g., glutamyl or aspartyl; or (e) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having such a side chain, e.g., glycine. Other variants include those designed to either generate a novel glycosylation and/or phosphorylation site(s), or those designed to delete an existing glycosylation and/or phosphorylation site(s). Variants include at least one amino acid substitution at a glycosylation site, a proteolytic cleavage site and/or a cysteine residue. Variants also include NTP proteins or antibodies, antibody fragments or antibody derivatives with additional amino acid residues before or after the NTP or antibody amino acid sequence on linker peptides. For example, a cysteine residue may be added at both the amino and carboxy terminals of an antibody fragment in order to allow the cyclisation of the antibody fragment by the formation of a di-sulphide bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; refers to a chemically modified protein or polypeptide that have been chemically modified either by natural processes, such as processing and other post-translational modifications, but also by chemical modification techniques, as for example, by addition of one or more polyethylene glycol molecules, sugars, phosphates, and/or other such molecules, where the molecule or molecules are not naturally attached to wild-type NTP proteins or antibodies. Derivatives include salts. Such chemical modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature, and they are well known to those of skill in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degree at several sites in a given protein or polypeptide. Also, a given protein or polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Modifications can occur anywhere in a protein or polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains, and the amino or carboxyl termini. Modifications include, for example, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins, such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. See, for instance, <highlight><italic>Proteins&mdash;&mdash;Structure And Molecular Properties, </italic></highlight>2nd Ed., T. E. Creighton, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993) and Wold, F., &ldquo;Posttranslational Protein Modifications: Perspectives and Prospects,&rdquo; pgs. 1-12 in <highlight><italic>Posttranslational Covalent Modification Of Proteins</italic></highlight>, B. C. Johnson, Ed., Academic Press, New York (1983); Seifter et al., <highlight><italic>Meth. Enzymol. </italic></highlight>182:626-646 (1990) and Rattan et al., &ldquo;Protein Synthesis: Posttranslational Modifications and Aging,&rdquo; Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 663: 48-62 (1992). The term &ldquo;derivatives&rdquo; include chemical modifications resulting in the protein or polypeptide becoming branched or cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched and branched circular proteins or polypeptides may result from post-translational natural processes and may be made by entirely synthetic methods, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;homolog&rdquo; refers to a protein that is at least 75 percent identical in its amino acid sequence of an NTP protein, AD7C-NTP or an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment, as the case may be, as determined by standard methods that are commonly used to compare the similarity in position of the amino acids of two polypeptides. The degree of similarity or identity between two proteins can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to those described in <highlight><italic>Computational Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988<highlight><italic>; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects</italic></highlight>, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993<highlight><italic>; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data</italic></highlight>, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994<highlight><italic>; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987<highlight><italic>; Sequence Analysis Primer</italic></highlight>, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; and Carillo H. and Lipman, D., SIAM, <highlight><italic>J. Applied Math., </italic></highlight>48: 1073 (1988). Preferred methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in publicly available computer programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Preferred computer program methods useful in determining the identity and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research, </italic></highlight>12(1): 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA, Atschul, S. F. et al., <highlight><italic>J. Molec. Biol., </italic></highlight>215: 403-410 (1990). The BLAST X program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S., et al., NCBI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul, S., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>215: 403-410 (1990). By way of example, using a computer algorithm such as GAP (Genetic Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), the two proteins or polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the &ldquo;matched span&rdquo;, as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3&times; (times) the average diagonal; the &ldquo;average diagonal&rdquo; is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the &ldquo;diagonal&rdquo; is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually {fraction (1/10)} times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison matrix (see Dayhoff et al. in: <highlight><italic>Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure</italic></highlight>, vol. 5, supp.3 &lsqb;1978&rsqb; for the PAM250 comparison matrix; see Henikoff et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, </italic></highlight>89:10915-10919 &lsqb;1992&rsqb; for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) also may be used by the algorithm. The percent identity then is calculated by the algorithm. Homologs will typically have one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared with NTP, AD7c-NTP, an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;peptide mimetic&rdquo; refers to biologically active compounds that mimic the biological activity of a peptide or a protein but are no longer peptidic in chemical nature, that is, they no longer contain any peptide bonds (that is, amide bonds between amino acids). Here the term peptide mimetic is used in a broader sense to include molecules that are no longer completely peptidic in nature, such as pseudo-peptides, semi-peptides and peptoids. Examples of peptide mimetics in this broader sense (where part of a peptide is replaced by a structure lacking peptide bonds) are described below. Whether completely or partially non-peptide, peptide mimetics according to this invention provide a spatial arrangement of reactive chemical moieties that closely resemble the three-dimensional arrangement of active groups in the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment on which the peptide mimetic is based. As a result of this similar active-site geometry, the peptide mimetic has effects on biological systems that are similar to the biological activity of the peptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The peptide mimetics of this invention are preferably substantially similar in both three-dimensional shape and biological activity to the antibodies, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments described herein Examples of methods of structurally modifying a peptide known in the art to create a peptide mimetic include the inversion of backbone chiral centers leading to D-amino acid residue structures that may, particularly at the N-terminus, lead to enhanced stability for proteolytical degradation without adversely affecting activity. An example is given in the paper &ldquo;Tritriated D-ala<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>-Peptide T Binding&rdquo;, Smith C. S. et al., <highlight><italic>Drug Development Res., </italic></highlight>15, pp. 371-379 (1988). A second method is altering cyclic structure for stability, such as N to C interchain imides and lactames (Ede et al. in Smith and Rivier (Eds.) &ldquo;Peptides: Chemistry and Biology&rdquo;, Escom, Leiden (1991), pp. 268-270). An example of this is given in conformationally restricted thymopentin-like compounds, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,457,489 (1985), Goldstein, G. et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A third method is to substitute peptide bonds in the antibody, antibody fragment or antibody derivative by pseudopeptide bonds that confer resistance to proteolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A number of pseudopeptide bonds have been described that in general do not affect peptide structure and biological activity. One example of this approach is to substitute retro-inverso pseudopeptide bonds (&ldquo;Biologically active retroinverso analogues of thymopentin&rdquo;, Sisto A. et al in Rivier, J. E. and Marshall, G. R. (eds) &ldquo;Peptides, Chemistry, Structure and Biology&rdquo;, Escom, Leiden (1990), pp. 722-773) and Dalpozzo, et al. (1993), <highlight><italic>Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., </italic></highlight>41:561-566, incorporated herein by reference). According to this modification, the amino acid sequences of the peptides may be identical to the sequences of the antibody described above, except that one or more of the peptide bonds are replaced by a retro-inverso pseudopeptide bond. Preferably the most N-terminal peptide bond is substituted, since such a substitution will confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus. Further modifications also can be made by replacing chemical groups of the amino acids with other chemical groups of similar structure. Another suitable pseudopeptide bond that is known to enhance stability to enzymatic cleavage with no or little loss of biological activity is the reduced isostere pseudopeptide bond is a (Couder, et al. (1993), <highlight><italic>Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., </italic></highlight>41:181-184, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, the amino acid sequences of these peptides may be identical to the sequences of an antibody, antibody fragment or antibody derivative, except that one or more of the peptide bonds are replaced by an isostere pseudopeptide bond. Preferably the most N-terminal peptide bond is substituted, since such a substitution would confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus. The synthesis of peptides with one or more reduced isostere pseudopeptide bonds is known in the art (Couder, et al. (1993), cited above). Other examples include the introduction of ketomethylene or methylsulfide bonds to replace peptide bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Peptoid derivatives of NTP peptides represent another class of peptide mimetics that retain the important structural determinants for biological activity, yet eliminate the peptide bonds, thereby conferring resistance to proteolysis (Simon, et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>89:9367-9371, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Peptoids are oligomers of N-substituted glycines. A number of N-alkyl groups have been described, each corresponding to the side chain of a natural amino acid (Simon, et al. (1992), cited above). Some or all of the amino acids of the antibody, antibody fragment or antibody derivative are replaced with the N-substituted glycine corresponding to the replaced amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;reverse-D peptide&rdquo; refers to a biologically active protein or peptide consisting of D-amino acids arranged in a reverse order as compared to the L-amino acid sequence of an antibody, antibody fragment, or antibody derivative. Thus, the carboxy terminal residue of an L-amino acid antibody protein, antibody fragment, or antibody derivative becomes the amino terminal for the D-amino acid peptide and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;enantiomer&rdquo; refers to a biologically active protein or peptide where one or more the L-amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of an antibody, antibody fragment, or antibody derivative is replaced with the corresponding D-amino acid residue(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Throughout this description, the term &ldquo;amyloidosis&rdquo; and the expression &ldquo;cerebral amyloidosis&rdquo; denotes a number of pathological conditions characterized by the deposition of abnormal fibrils (&ldquo;amyloid fibrils&rdquo;) and/or related non-fibrillar amyloid precursor or non-precursor molecule, as well as the presence of NTP in extracellular spaces, including, for example, the Alzheimer group of diseases, namely, Alzheimer&apos;s disease (pre-senile dementia, senile dementia); Alzheimer&apos;s disease associated with Down&apos;s syndrome; familial Alzheimer&apos;s Disease; genetic Alzheimer&apos;s disease due to mutations such as Presenilin 1, Presenilin 2, and others; Alzheimer&apos;s disease associated with other central-nervous-system diseases, such as Parkinson&apos;s disease, Lewy Body Disease, and cerebrovascular diseases; congophilic angiopathy (associated or not associated with Alzheimer&apos;s disease, familial or not familial), and other disorders and diseases such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,331, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Throughout this description, the expressions &ldquo;amyloid plaques&rdquo; and &ldquo;amyloid fibrils&rdquo; denote senile plaques, neuritic plaques, amyloid plaques, amyloid stars, amyloid cores, primitive plaques, classical plaques, burn out plaques, diffuse plaques, shadow plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid fibrils, paired helical filaments, and the like. Throughout this description, the term &ldquo;mammal&rdquo; denotes all mammals, and preferably denotes, sheep, cows, dogs, cats, apes, monkeys, mice, rats, and humans, and most preferably denotes a human. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed toward methods of preventing cell death and/or tissue necrosis in live tissue containing NTP. While NTP has been known and described in the literature, it was not heretofore known that NTP was a cause of cell death of cells other than the cells producing the NTP. While not intending on being bound by any theory, the present inventor believes that the presence of NTP in live tissue not only is an indication of certain nerve cell death, as previously reported, but it also is toxic insofar as it causes other live tissue cell death. The present inventor believes that NTP present in live mammalian brain tissue is a marker for Alzheimer&apos;s Disease (AD), and it exacerbates AD by causing cell death and/or tissue necrosis in the live tissue in which it exists. Accordingly, it is believed that, as a mammal becomes inflicted with AD, nerve cell death up-regulates the gene that produces NTP, thereby producing NTP at that site. The NTP so produced then begins destroying other live tissue (e.g., other nerve cells, glial cells, etc.) in the vicinity thereof, thereby exacerbating the progression of the disease. The inventor therefore believes that neutralizing the NTP with an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment will help prevent, inhibit, reduce, control and/or ameliorate cell death and/or tissue necrosis in live tissue that contains NTP or that has been contacted by NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The ability of NTP to cause cell death and/or tissue necrosis in live tissue where it is present makes it useful for removing or destroying harmful or unwanted tissue or cellular elements such as benign or malignant tumors in humans as disclosed in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ and entitled &ldquo;Methods of Treating Tumors and Related Conditions Using Neural Thread Proteins.&rdquo; The inventor anticipates that it would be useful to modulate, control, prevent or inhibit the cell death and/or tissue necrosis caused by the administration of NTP for such a purpose, particularly to avoid or reduce cell death or tissue necrosis in surrounding tissue. The inventor therefore believes that neutralizing the NTP with an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment will help modulate, control, prevent or inhibit cell death and/or tissue necrosis either in or near live tissue where NTP has been administered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Methods of making NTP recombinantly or otherwise are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634, 5,948,888, 5,830,670, and 6,071,705, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Raising antibodies against NTP so that one can diagnose AD and other associated disorders and diseases, also is disclosed in these documents. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that one may use NTP fragments, homologs, derivatives and variants, as well as NTP from diverse sources (e.g., natural, pancreatic, purified, synthesized, or from different expression systems in vitro, etc.) to make or screen for any of the antibodies, antibody fragments or antibody derivatives useful in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The use of NTP fragments to raise or screen for antibodies, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments also is encompassed by the scope of the invention. Depending on the purpose, it is common to utilize a smaller active fragment of a larger active molecule. The use of molecules of the NTP family, such as AD7C-NTP and other neural thread proteins and pancreatic thread proteins, is also encompassed by the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The monoclonal antibodies, particularly mAbs Th7, Th9, Th10, and N314, useful in the present invention, may be prepared as previously described (Gross et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest. </italic></highlight>76:2115-2126 (1985); Ozturk et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>86:419-423 (1989); de la Monte et. al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest. </italic></highlight>86:1004-1013 (1990); de la Monte et. al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurol. Sci. </italic></highlight>113:152-164 (1992); de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Neurol. </italic></highlight>32:733-742 (1992); and de la Monte, S. M., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, </italic></highlight>55:1038-1050 (1996)). The Th monoclonal antibodies were generated against the purified pancreatic form of thread protein (Id.). NTP-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can also be generated against a substantially pure NTP isolated from recombinant hosts (for example, see Carroll et al., &ldquo;Production and Purification of Polyclonal Antibodies to the Foreign Segment of &bgr;-Galactosidase Fusion Proteins,&rdquo; in <highlight><italic>DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach</italic></highlight>, Volume III, IRL Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 89-111 (1987); Mole et al., &ldquo;Production of Monoclonal Antibodies Against Fusion Proteins Produced in <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; in <highlight><italic>DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach</italic></highlight>, Volume III, IRL Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 113-1139 (1987)). Alternatively, NTP-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be generated against a substantially pure NTP isolated from biological material such as brain tissue and cell lines, by using well known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For example, monoclonal antibodies specific for the various NTP molecules of approximately, 8, 14, 17, 21, 26, and 42 kDa molecular weights may be prepared from recombinant-derived proteins, which are expressed, isolated, and purified from the cDNA (i.e., 1-9a), genomic clones (G2-2 PstI) and AD-NTP 3-4 cDNA clones. These NTP molecules can be derived from the above cDNAs and genomic clones, inserted and produced in suitable expression vectors. Since there are regions of 60-70% homology in the 5&prime; ends of the 1-9a NTP cDNA and PTP, one can obtain monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the NTP recombinant proteins and not to the pancreatic form by performing routine differential screening (see, for example, de la Monte et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest. </italic></highlight>86: 1004-1013 (1990)). Although there will be monoclonal antibodies that bind to both NTP and PTP, it will be possible to generate NTP-specific monoclonal antibodies because there is a substantial sequence divergence between NTP molecules of various forms (e.g., 8, 14, 17, 21, 26, and 42 kDa) and because an epitope may be defined by as few as 6-8 amino acids. In the present invention, monoclonal antibodies that bind to both NTP and PTP can be used in the present invention so long as they are capable of inhibiting, preventing, and/or ameliorating cell death and/or tissue necrosis in live tissue that contains NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The antibodies may also be prepared by using chimeric or transgenic animals such as mice developed by Abgenix using its Xenomouse technology (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,963, 6,150,584, 6,114,598, 6,075,181, and 5,939,598) or HuMAb-Mouse, Kirn TC Mouse or KM-Mouse mice developed by Medarex (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,300,129, 5,877,397, 5,874,299, 5,814,318, 5,789,650, 5,770,429, 5,661,016, 5,633,425, 5,625,126, 5,569,825, and 5,545,806). The disclosures of each of these patents are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Antibody fragments may be prepared by those ordinarily skilled in the art using well-known techniques. Antibody derivatives may be prepared from biologically active antibodies, antibody fragments or other antibody derivatives using phage display, bacterial cell surface display or yeast cell surface display technologies in order to create combinatorial peptide libraries. NTP can then be used to screen such libraries to identify biologically active antibodies, antibody fragments or antibody derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The use of filamentous phage display vectors, referred to as phagemids, is a well-known method for the efficient preparation of large libraries of monoclonal antibodies having diverse and novel immunospecificites. The technology uses a filamentous phage coat protein membrane anchor domain as a means for linking gene-product and gene during the assembly of filamentous phage replication, and has been used for the cloning and expression of antibodies from combinatorial libraries (Kang, et al, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., </italic></highlight>88:4363, 1991, Barbas, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., </italic></highlight>88:7978, 1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In phage display, the protein of interest (an antibody, antibody fragment or antibody derivative in this case) is expressed as a polypeptide fusion to a bacteriophage coat protein and subsequently screened by binding to immobilized or soluble biotinylated ligand (in this case NTP) in a process called &ldquo;panning.&rdquo;Phage bearing nonspecific antibodies can be removed by washing, and then the bound phage are eluted and amplified by infection of E. coli. Phage display has been successfully applied to generate antibodies against many antigens, including hepatitis B surface antigen; polysaccharides, insulin-like growth factor 1, 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, and 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitro-phenacetyl-(NIP)-caproic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Yeast and bacterial cell surface display technologies are other methods in which a diverse array of proteins, including antibodies and antibody fragments, may be displayed and then screened for those that exhibit favorable characteristics, such as the ability to bind to an antigen with the desired affinity and specificity. (Bader, ET et al, <highlight><italic>Nat Biotechnol </italic></highlight>15: 553-557 (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,065, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety; Francisco, JA et al, <highlight><italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </italic></highlight>89: 2713-2717 (1992); Georgiou G, et al, <highlight><italic>Nat Biotech </italic></highlight>15: 29-34 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It may be necessary to humanize monoclonal antibodies produced using mammals that are not humans. The use of such non-human antibodies in vivo in humans can lead to problems. The foreign immunoglobulins can elicit an anti-globulin response (known as a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response) that can interfere with therapy (R. A. Miller et al, <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>62 988-995 (1983)) or cause allergic or immune complex hypersensitivity (B. Ratner, <highlight><italic>Allergy</italic></highlight>, Anaphylaxis and Immunotherapy Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore (1943)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> One approach to overcoming these problems is to humanize such antibodies by modifying them accordingly. Two general methods of humanization have been developed: (i) loop-grafting, where the CDR loops are grafted directly onto the human Fv framework found to most closely resemble the sequence of the non-human animal; and (ii) resurfacing, where those Fv framework residues that are most exposed on the surface are mutated to their human counterpart. Winter and colleagues (GB2188638B) developed one such method. The complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the mouse antibody, which comprise the antigen combining site, are inserted into human framework regions thereby generating antibodies in which only the CDR sequences are derived from the original mouse antibody. Herceptin and Rituxan are two successful examples of humanized antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use. Combinatorial methods employing such technologies as phage display can also be used to generate humanized antibodies and antibody fragments as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The use of cloned conjugates of antibody fragments targeted to recombinant NTP or cloned conjugates of antibody-like proteins targeted to recombinant NTP also is encompassed by the scope of the invention. The advantages of a cloned conjugate targeted to NTP or a related molecule include manufacturing and standardized production of the cloned conjugated molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Methods of making and detecting such antibodies, antibody fragments, or antibody derivatives are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are described in more detail below. Standard reference works setting forth the general principles of immunology include the work of Klein (<highlight><italic>Immunology: The Science of Self-Nonself Discrimination</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1982)); Kennett et al. (<highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies and Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses</italic></highlight>, Plenum Press, New York (1980)); Campbell (&ldquo;Monoclonal Antibody Technology,&rdquo; In: <highlight><italic>Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, Volume 13 (Burdon, R., et al., eds.), Elsevier, Amsterdam (1984)); and Eisen (In: <highlight><italic>Microbiology, </italic></highlight>3rd Ed. (Davis, et al., Harper &amp; Row, Philadelphia (1980)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The antibodies, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments useful in the present invention also can be conjugated to various labeling components, or radioactive components. In this embodiment of the invention, the labeled antibody can be administered, bind to NTP in live tissue, detected using various techniques known in the art, and then various types of radiation can be employed in a precise, controlled manner to neutralize or kill the NTP, thereby achieving the same effect. Various methods of labeling NTP-antibodies and fragments, as well as their detection are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634, 5,948,888, 5,830,670, and 6,071,705. Radioactive-labeled antibodies, antibody derivatives and antibody fragments also can be used as described above, with the exception that the radioactive portion of the antibody conjugate may serve to neutralize or otherwise kill the NTP without the need for exogenous radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The antibodies, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments preferably are contacted with live tissue containing NTP. Any live tissue that contains NTP, or that might at some point in time contain NTP is encompassed by the present invention. Preferably, the tissue is tissue selected from mammalian tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention includes a method of treating conditions caused by necrosis of live tissue due to the presence of NTP. In this context, the necrosis of live tissue and cell death due to the presence of NTP denotes cell death and/or tissue necrosis of cells other than the dying cells that produce the NTP. In the method, an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment as described above that binds to or otherwise recognizes NTP is administered to a mammal suffering from such a condition in an amount and for a period of time sufficient to prevent and/or inhibit the live tissue necrosis caused by the presence of NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The treatment of nervous system disorders or other brain-related disorders can be achieved by administering drugs that affect nervous system function or dysfunction in animals or patients. Typically, such drugs are administered by peripheral application, either via the oral or the systemic route. While some drugs are able to cross the blood brain barrier (bbb), others do not pass the bbb efficiently or not at all and are only effective when given directly into the brain. The term &ldquo;blood-brain barrier&rdquo; or &ldquo;bbb&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to the bbb proper as well as to the blood-spinal barrier. The blood-brain barrier, which consists of the endothelium of the brain vessels, the basal membrane and neuroglial cells, acts to limit penetration of substances into the brain. Sometimes the structure of the bbb is subdivided into two components: the endothelial or capillary barrier and the ependymal barrier. Banks, W. A., Kastin, A. J., Barrera, &ldquo;Delivering peptides to the central nervous system: Dilemmas and strategies,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Pharm. Res. </italic></highlight>8:1345-1350 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The nature of the substance penetration through the bbb has not yet been determined but it is known that many of the regulators of brain function such as cytokines, transferrin, encephalins and endorphines can pass through the bbb from the blood vessels into the brain. Raeissi, S., Audus, J., &ldquo;In vitro characterization of blood-brain barrier permeability to delta sleep-inducing peptide.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Pharm. Phy. </italic></highlight>41:848-852(1989); Zlokovich, B., Susie, V. T., Davson, H. Begley, D. J., Jankov, R. M., Mitrivic, B. M., Lipovac, M. N., &ldquo;Saturable mechanism for delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) at the blood-brain barrier of the vascularly perfused guinea pig brain.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Peptides </italic></highlight>10:249-254(1989); and Zlokovich, B., &ldquo;In vivo approaches for studying peptide interaction at the blood-brain barrier.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Control. Rel. </italic></highlight>13:185-201(1990). However, many substances that can affect the Central Nervous System (or CNS) such as adenosine, &ldquo;&bgr;-endorphin, synthetic analogs of endogenous peptides Houghten, R. A. Swann, R. W., Li, C. H., &bgr;-Endorphin: Stability, clearance behavior and entry into the central nervous system after intravenous injection of the tritiated peptide in rats and rabbits.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>77:4588-4591(1980); Levin, E. R., Frank, H. J. K., Weber, M.

Commun. </italic></highlight>147:1226-1231(1987) Sakane, T., Tanaka, C., Yamamoto, A., Hashida, M., Sesaki, H., Ueda, H., Takagi, H., &ldquo;The effect of polysorbate 80 on brain uptake and analgesic effect of D-kyoto.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Int. J. Pharm. </italic></highlight>57:77-83(1989), as well as some excitatory and inhibitor amino acids and trophic factors, penetrate poorly or not at all through the bbb. At present, drugs with no bbb penetration or poor bbb penetration can only be given by direct CNS infusion or by implantation of controlled-release polymers. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,666, Sabel et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> One way to overcome some of the limitations of traditional drug therapy is to increase the relative amount of drug that passes the bbb. The belief is that if one can increase the amount of the drug crossing the bbb while reducing the peripheral dose of a given drug or diagnostic substance, the peripheral side effects of the drug are also less severe, while at the same time maintaining the desired effect in the brain. A number of approaches have been described as effective in increasing drug penetration through the bbb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> One approach has been to alter the function of the bbb itself. For instance, osmotic agents, when given peripherally (such as by intravenous injection), result in the opening of the bbb. Further, some drugs acting on the CNS can change the permeability of the bbb for other substances; cholinomimetic arecolines, for instance, have been reported to induce changes of drug penetration through the bbb. Saija, A., Princi, P., De Pasquale, R., Costa, G., &ldquo;Arecoline but not haloperidol produces changes in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in the rat.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Pharm. Pha. </italic></highlight>42:135-138 (1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Other drugs that can be administered to alter the permeability of the bbb are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,059,415 and 5,124,146, both issued to E. A. Neuwelt. Bradykinin is one specific drug with such effects. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,596, issued to Malfroy-Camine). Another method comprises administering permeabilizer peptides such as A-7 or conformational analogs thereof. (WO 92/18529, an application of J. W. Kozarich et al.). A relatively invasive method has been proposed by A. Tomasz and E. Tuomanen (WO 91/16064) who administer parenteral injections of purified cell wall or cell wall fragments of eubacteria such as <highlight><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic></highlight>to open the bbb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,210 issued to L. L. Rubin et al., discloses a method whereby the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is increased by administering an agent that reduces or interferes with cyclic AMP concentrations or that increases cyclic GMP concentrations. Another approach is the modification of the drug molecules themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> For instance, macromolecules, such as proteins, may not pass the bbb at all, or may pass through with difficulty or with alterations that adversely impact the proteins efficacy. For example, one can first isolate the macromolecule active site, i.e., the portion of the molecule that triggers the biologically desirable event, and then use only this active site. Since size is one of the factors in allowing permeability of the bbb, the reduced size can be used so that the smaller molecule can now pass the bbb. Use of antibody fragments therefore is desirable in this context. Other modifications to macromolecules to attempt passage of the bbb include glycating the proteins, thereby enhancing their permeability of the bbb, or forming a prodrug. U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,308, issued to J. F. Podusio and G. L. Curran, discusses glycating proteins, while U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,324 and WO 89/07938, both on applications of V. E. Shashoua, disclose formation of a prodrug. These prodrugs are formed from a fatty acid carrier and a neuroactive drug which is unable to pass across the bbb on its own. A similar system is disclosed in WO 89/07938. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Still another approach is the implantation of controlled release polymers that release the active ingredient from a matrix-system directly into the nervous tissue. However, this approach is invasive and requires surgical intervention if implanted directly into the brain or spinal cord (see Sabel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,666; and Sabel et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/407,930). It also is known to administer compositions directly to internal portions of the brain, as disclosed on U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,390, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. These methods enable the delivery of sustained release, solid preparations and semi-solid preparations directly to brain tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> To overcome these limitations, another approach has been tried in which drug carrier systems are used such as liposomes, erythrocyte ghosts, antibody-conjugates, and monoclonal antibody conjugates. One of the major problems in targeted drug delivery is the rapid opsonization and uptake of injected carriers by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), especially by the macrophages in the liver and spleen. This obstacle may be partially overcome in the case of liposomes by incorporation of so-called &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol, monosialoganglioside, or sulfogalactosylceramide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,182,107 and 5,154,924, both issued to P. M. Friden, teach a method of conjugating a drug with an antibody where the antibody is reactive with a transferrin receptor. Transferrin receptors are located on brain capillary endothelial cells, which thus can transport a drug, such as nerve growth factor, across the bbb. U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,697 (issued to Pardridge) improves such an antibody-conjugate method by providing cationized antibodies with a specific isoelectric point (see also WO 89/01343 by Pardridge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Another approach is to create chimeric peptides to which the active agents are conjugated (U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,575, also issued to Pardridge). Such a system is further discussed also in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,505, issued to Pardridge and Schimmel, in which the chimeric peptide, such as histone, is capable of crossing the bbb by transcytosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,187,158 and 5,017,566, both issued to N. S. Bodor, disclose a brain-specific drug delivery method wherein a centrally acting drug is given with the reduced, biooxidizable lipoidal form of a dihydropyridine reaction-pyridine salt redox carrier such as dopamine. (See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,816, also issued to Bodor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A rather invasive approach is taken to deliver genetic material to the brain. This is done, for example, by chemically disrupting the bbb and then using viruses to deliver genes across the bbb. (See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,042, issued to E. A. Neuwelt). Here, a corrective genetic material is incorporated into a virus and the virus is then injected into the bloodstream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Finally, yet another carrier system to deliver drugs across the bbb is the use of liposomes, as disclosed by F. D. Collins and R. C. Thompson (WO 91/04014). Here, liposomes are targeted to specific endogenous brain transport systems that transport specific ligands across the bbb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Another approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,454, to Kreuter, et al. The subject matter of the Kreuter patent includes a method, composition and drug targeting system using surfactant coated nanoparticles as a drug carrier (or targeting molecule) for a wide range of drugs in order to enhance the penetration of drugs or diagnostic agents across the bbb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The art therefore proposes a number of different approaches to detecting AD and the presence of NTP in the brain, as well as a number of approaches to rendering drugs or other therapeutics accessible to the brain by allowing them to traverse the bbb. The art does not recognize the importance of preventing cell death and/or tissue necrosis caused by NTP in AD brain or in other tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that instead of directly administering the antibody, the antibody can be produced or expressed by the mammal through gene expression (e.g., gene therapy) or through a vaccine. Skilled artisans are capable of creating, isolating and purifying suitable genes or vaccines useful in inducing antibody or antibody fragment expression, using the guidelines provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> For example, gene therapy has attracted wide attention as a method to treat various mammalian diseases and enhance production of specific proteins or other cellular products. Gene therapy generally is accomplished by introducing exogenous genetic material into a mammalian patient&apos;s cells. The introduced genetic material can be designed to replace an abnormal (defective) gene of the mammalian patient (&ldquo;gene replacement therapy&rdquo;), or can be designed for expression of the encoded protein or other therapeutic product without replacement of any defective gene (&ldquo;gene augmentation&rdquo;). Because many congenital and acquired medical disorders result from inadequate production of various gene products, gene therapy provides a means to treat these diseases through either transient or stable expression of exogenous nucleic acid encoding the therapeutic product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Gene therapy can be accomplished by either direct transformation of target cells within the mammalian subject (in vivo gene therapy) or transformation of cells in vitro and subsequent implantation of the transformed cells into the mammalian subject (ex vivo gene therapy). In vivo gene therapy is particularly preferred for use in the present invention. In addition to repair of somatic cells, it is generally known that in vivo gene therapy also can be used for systemic treatment, an area in which gene therapy has broad applications. Systemic treatment involves transfecting target cells with the DNA of interest, expressing the coded protein in that cell, and the capability of the transformed cell to subsequently secrete the manufactured protein into blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods have been developed to accomplish in vivo transformation including mechanical means (e.g, direct injection of nucleic acid into target cells or particle bombardment), recombinant viruses, liposomes, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) (for reviews, see Chang et al. 1994 <highlight><italic>Gastroenterol. </italic></highlight>106:1076-84; Morsy et al. 1993 <highlight><italic>JAMA </italic></highlight>270:2338-45; and Ledley 1992 <highlight><italic>J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. </italic></highlight>14:328-37). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Suitable methods of developing and administering genes and vaccines suitable to induce in vivo expression of the antibody or antibody fragments that recognize or bind to NTP are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,210,919 and 6,225,290. The disclosures of each of these patents is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Any condition caused by cell death and necrosis of live tissue due to the presence of NTP can be treated in accordance with the present invention. Preferably, the condition is selected from AD, stroke, brain tumor, and other brain diseases, in particular, neurodegenerative diseases (such as AD, Pick&apos;s Disease, Lewy body Disease, Parkinson&apos;s Disease, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the method includes contacting live tissue containing NTP with at least one antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that binds to NTP in an amount sufficient to prevent cell death and/or tissue necrosis caused by the presence of the NTP. Methods of administering an antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that binds to NTP include administering the antibody intramuscularly, orally, intravenously, intrathecally, intranasally, topically, transdermally, etc. In addition, the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment can be expressed or produced in vivo by administration of a gene that expresses the protein, or by administration of a vaccine that induces such production, as described above. Further, the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment can be expressed or produced in vivo by administration or introduction of a cell, bacteria or virus that expresses the protein in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound usually is admixed with at least one of the following: (a) one or more inert excipients (or carrier), such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate; (b) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; (c) binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; (d) humectants, such as glycerol; (e) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate; (f) solution retarders, such as paraffin; (g) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (h) wetting agents, such as acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (i) adsorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite; and (j) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. For capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active antibody compounds, the liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents, and emulsifiers. Exemplary emulsifiers are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, oils, such as cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil, and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or mixtures of these substances, and the like. Besides such inert diluents, the composition can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Another method of administering the antibody that recognizes or binds to NTP is by a transdermal or transcutaneous route. One example of such an embodiment is the use of a patch. In particular, a patch can be prepared with a fine suspension of antibody in, for example, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or a mixture of DMSO with cottonseed oil and brought into contact with the skin of the mammals away from the location site where the tissue containing NTP exists. The composition may be present inside a skin pouch. Other mediums or mixtures thereof with other solvents and solid supports would work equally as well. The patch can contain the antibody or antibody fragment in the form of a solution or a suspension. The patch can then be applied to the skin of the patient, for example, by means of inserting it into a skin pouch of the patient formed by folding and holding the skin together by means of stitches, clips or other holding devices. This pouch should be employed in such a manner so that continuous contact with the skin is assured without the interference of the mammal. Besides using a skin pouch, any device can be used which ensures the firm placement of the patch in contact with the skin. For instance, an adhesive bandage could be used to hold the patch in place on the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the compositions of the invention may be varied to obtain an antibody-containing composition that is effective to obtain a desired tissue necrosis-inhibiting therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration, the desired duration of treatment, and other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> With mammals, including humans, the effective amounts can be administered on the basis of body surface area. The interrelationship of dosages for animals of various sizes, species, and humans (based on mg/M<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of body surface) is described by E. J. Freireich et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Chemother. Rep., </italic></highlight>50(4):219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately determined from the height and weight of an individual (see e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, N.Y. pp. 537-538 (1970)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The total daily dose of the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that binds to NTP that is administered to a host may be in single or divided doses. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of such submultiples thereof as may be used to make up the daily dose. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time and route of administration, potency of the administered drug, rates of absorption and excretion, combination with other drugs and the severity of the particular disease being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The antibody-containing compositions of the present invention preferably contain a component that enables the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier to treat live brain tissue containing NTP. Any of the variety of components described above can be used to render the antibodies capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. For example, only a small binding portion or fragment of the antibody (e.g., the F(ab) or F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>portion) may be used, whereby the fragment is small enough to traverse the blood-brain barrier. In this case, no additional component would be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment may be glycated to enhance the permeability of the bbb, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,308, or formed into a prodrug, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,324 and WO 89/07938. These prodrugs preferably are formed from a fatty acid carrier and an antibody that binds or otherwise recognizes NTP, which is unable to pass across the bbb on its own. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach is the implantation of controlled release polymers that release the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment from a matrix-system directly into the nervous tissue (see Sabel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,666; and Sabel et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/407,930.). It also is possible to use drug carrier systems such as liposomes, erythrocyte ghosts, antibody-conjugates, and monoclonal antibody conjugates. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, so-called &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol, monosialoganglioside, or sulfogalactosylceramide can be used to form the liposomes containing the aforementioned antibodies and antibody conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The antibodies, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments that bind to NTP may be conjugated with another antibody that is reactive with a transferrin receptor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,182,107 and 5,154,924. Transferrin receptors are located on brain capillary endothelial cells, which thus transport a drug, such as nerve growth factor, or other antibodies such as those raised against NTP, across the bbb. The antibody-antibody conjugate described above can be further enhanced by providing cationized antibodies with a specific isoelectric point, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,697 and WO 89/01343. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention encompasses creating chimeric peptides to which the active antibody, antibody derivative and/or antibody fragment is conjugated, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,575. The chimeric peptide preferably is histone, which is capable of crossing the bbb by transcytosis, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,505. A further embodiment of the invention includes providing the antibody or antibody fragment together with the reduced, biooxidizable lipoidal form of a dihydropyridine reaction-pyridine salt redox carrier such as dopamine, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,880,816, 5,187,158, and 5,071,566. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Another approach also can be taken to deliver the antibody, antibody derivatives or antibody fragments to the brain. This can be done by chemically disrupting the bbb and then using viruses to deliver the antibody, antibody derivative(s) or antibody fragment(s) across the bbb, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,042. Here, it is preferred that a corrective genetic material is incorporated into a virus and the virus is then injected into the bloodstream. Yet another carrier system that can be used to deliver the antibody, antibody derivative(s) or antibody fragment(s) across the bbb is the use of liposomes, as disclosed by F. D. Collins and R. C. Thompson (WO 91/04014). Here, liposomes preferably are targeted to specific endogenous brain transport systems that transport specific ligands across the bbb. Surfactant coated nanoparticles also can be used as a drug carrier (or targeting molecule) for the antibody, antibody derivative(s) or antibody fragment(s) of the invention in order to enhance the penetration thereof across the bbb, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,454, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Another approach is to use L-amino acid oxidase to reduce the plasma level of the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment to allow transport of the antibody, derivative or fragment across the bbb. Such an approach is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,751, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Another approach in accordance with the present invention is to administer compositions comprising the antibody, derivative or fragment locally. Devices useful in administering compositions to an internal portion of the brain are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,390, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Sustained release, solid preparations and semi-solid preparations can be administered directly to brain tissue. Such administration can be accomplished by inserting a needle-like member of such an intracerebral device that is optionally implanted in the head so that a distal end of the guide is positioned at a site of administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A preferred composition of the present invention for administration to a mammal suffering from a condition caused by cell death and/or tissue necrosis due to the presence of NTP contains the antibody, antibody derivative and/or antibody fragment that recognizes NTP, and a component that enables the antibody, derivative or fragment to cross the bbb. Other preferred compositions of the present invention include a gene that expresses the antibody, antibody derivative and/or antibody fragment, and a component that enables the gene to cross the bbb. An additional preferred composition of the present invention includes a vaccine that induces expression of the antibody, antibody derivative and/or antibody fragment, and a component that enables the vaccine to cross the bbb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> It is preferred in the present invention that the amount of antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that contacts the live tissue containing NTP be an amount sufficient to inhibit, prevent, and/or ameliorate cell death and/or tissue necrosis caused by NTP. The specific amount can be determined by those skilled in the art, using the guidelines provided herein. It is preferred that enough antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment be administered to reduce cell death or tissue necrosis by more than 50%, when compared to a control where no antibody is present and cell death caused by NTP goes unchecked. More preferably, the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment is administered to reduce cell death or tissue necrosis by more than 60%, even more preferably by more than 70%, and most preferably by more than 75%, when compared to a control where no antibody is present and cell death or tissue necrosis caused by NTP goes unchecked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Such an amount will invariably depend on the particular type of tissue, the antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment used, as well as the amount of NTP. Using the methods disclosed in any of the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634, 5,948,888, 5,830,670, and 6,071,705, one can estimate the relative amount of NTP present, and then conduct a series of in vitro experiments using mammalian tissue obtained from various sources, such as any of those disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patents, determining the amount of NTP in the tissue, and then determining the requisite amount of antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that binds to NTP that is required to obtain the requisite degree of cell death or tissue necrosis prevention (i.e., preferably by more than 60% when compared to a control). Skilled artisans are capable of carrying out these experiments without undue experimentation, using techniques known in the art, as well as using the guidelines provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The amount of antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment to be administered to the mammal that has the tissue containing NTP then can readily be determined based on the body weight of the mammal, and the expected delivery amount to the tissue. The amount of antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment that will be expected to be delivered to the brain tissue of a mammal will depend on the particular mechanism that is employed to render the antibody, derivative or fragment capable of crossing the bbb. The same holds true for administration of genes that express the antibody, derivative or fragment, or for the administration of vaccines that induce expression or production of the antibody, derivative or fragment. Again, those skilled in the art are capable of determining without undue experimentation the appropriate dose of gene, vaccine, antibody, antibody derivative or antibody fragment to administer to a mammal using the techniques described in the aforementioned patents that are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, and by using the guidelines provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not to be limited to the specific conditions or details described in these examples. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates cell death in live tissue (in vivo) due to the presence of AD7C-NTP. AD7C-NTP was obtained in accordance with the procedures outlined in any one of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634, 5,948,888, 5,830,670, and 6,017,705. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Eight normal rats were injected in the skin and subcutaneously, each in 3 different foci, with purified recombinant AD7C-NTP in saline at concentrations of 0.1-1.0 &mgr;g/mL delivered from plastic syringes through stainless steel 26 gauge needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The animals were observed for 24 hours and painlessly sacrificed at 24 hours. The 24 individual foci of infiltration were excised, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained and examined by standard histopathological methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Similar groups of control rats were injected with (1) bovine serum albumin in saline, (2) normal human serum, and (3) physiological saline, and examined and sacrificed as above, with the excised foci of injection treated as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Injection of AD7C-NTP in all examples produced acute necrosis of tissue at the injection sites (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are microphotographs showing the histopathological lesions induced by injection of the AD7C-NTP. The necrosis is evident in muscle tissue, subcutaneous connective tissue, and dermis at the sites where the AD7C-NTP was injected. At 24 hours, cells appear pale, shrunken, and necrotic, and there is infiltration with inflammatory cells. The necrosis correlates with the areas of injection and does not appear to spread far beyond the site of injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Controls showed no evidence of necrosis or cell loss. Control injections had mild to minimal acute inflammation and focal microhemorrhages from the needles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates preventing and/or inhibiting necrosis of live tissue (in vivo) by administering an antibody to tissue that contains AD7C-NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The antibody to AD7C-NTP consisted of monoclonal antibody N314 as described in de la Monte, SM, et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology; </italic></highlight>55: 1038-1050 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> AD7C-NTP was obtained as described above in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Recombinant AD7C-NTP samples 100 ng/mL-10 &mgr;g/mL were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to one hour with N314 antibody and then injected into rats as described in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The animals were observed for 24 hours and painlessly sacrificed at 24 hours. The 24 individual foci of infiltration were excised, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained and examined by standard histopathological methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Similar groups of control rats were injected with (1) AD7C-NTP alone as described in Example 1, (2) bovine serum albumin in saline, (3) normal human serum, and (4) physiological saline, and examined and sacrificed as above, with the excised foci of injection treated as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The control injections of AD7C-NTP alone produced tissue necrosis, as described in Example 1, and shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Control injections of bovine serum albumin (BSA), normal human serum, and physiological saline all showed no evidence of necrosis or cell loss. The above control injections had mild to minimal acute inflammation and focal microhemorrhages from the needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The AD7C-NTP samples that were injected together with the N314 antibody showed over 95% reduction in tissue necrosis, when compared to the control samples injected with AD7C-NTP alone. There were occasional focal nodules of inflammatory cell foci with micronodule formation which appeared to possibly be aggregation of AD7C-NTP and N314. The overall tissue injury was reduced by &gt;95% by administration of the N314 antibody, when compared to controls that were injected only with AD7C-NTP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail with reference to particularly preferred embodiments and examples, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
