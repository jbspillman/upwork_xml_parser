<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to vaso-occlusive devices and methods of treating conditions manifesting abnormal blood flow employing the vaso-occlusive devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ruptured blood vessels in the brain cause an acute condition known as hemorrhagic stroke. Ruptures or strokes can occur with a number of vascular abnormalities including arterio venous malformation (AVM), fistula, aneurysm (a ballooning of the arterial wall), or a burst blood vessel. In addition, abnormal vasculature is generated in the process of tumor growth and tumors including brain tumors are highly vascularized entities requiring larger than normal blood flow to sustain the tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Endovascular therapy for vaso-occlusion has included injectable agents, balloon-type occlusive devices, and mechanical vaso-occlusive devices such as metal coils. A description of these agents and devices is included in the background section of U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,069. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently, coils for aneurysms and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles for AVMs are FDA approved preventative therapies. Cyanoacrylate glue for AVMs is also proposed and pending approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Over 400,000 persons worldwide, and 125,000 persons in the U.S. annually experience some form of hemorrhagic stroke or blood vessel rupture in the brain. A need exists in the medical community and the field of interventional neurology for devices and/or agents that can be effectively used in interventional radiology treatments at sites of abnormal blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Current embolic devices are made from platinum, tungsten, and stainless steel. All these materials create very minimal biological response when place in the body. The disadvantage of using metals which are inert in the body are that they operate as purely mechanical emboli and create a thrombotic response by providing stagnation and turbulence in the area of abnormal blood flow. Another disadvantage of using metal embolic devices is that the metal in the device can create artifacts under magnetic resonance imaging. A need exists for devices that can provide a biological response in addition to mechanical blockage would be of great use to the medical community in this regard. </paragraph>

In either embodiment, for example, the non-metal material can comprise a polymer or combination of polymers in a solid form (e.g. a single polymer or a combination of two or more polymers either as a copolymer or as a blend). Suitable definitions for the terms biocompatible and biodegradable are found in Katz, Medical Devices and Diagnostic Industry, January 2001, &ldquo;Developments in Medical Polymers for Biomaterials Applications&rdquo;, pp 122-132. Materials for use in making the vaso-occlusive devices are also describe in Katz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for implantation into the vasculature of a patient to occlude abnormal blood flow comprising a solid material comprises a polymer or combination of polymers in a solid form. As discussed above, the solid material is configured in a pre-implantation shape before implantation (including shapes described above) and can change into a vaso-occluding shape after implantation (also as described above. The pre-delivery material can also be a liquid injectable that becomes a solid after injection into the patient, either by polymerizing to a solid or precipitating to a solid. The resulting solid in either case assumes some kind of vaso-occluding shape, including but not limited to amorphous shapes.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also comprise a bioactive agent that is reactive at the site of implantation. For example, the bioactive agent may promote maintaining the device at the site of abnormal blood flow, may promote regrowth of a damaged vascular wall, may help to heal the site, may inhibit continued or re-vascularization, may inhibit or regress tumor growth, and such like biological activities at the site of implantation or abnormal blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The bioactive agent can be any bioactive agent capable of reacting at the site of implantation of the vaso-occlusive device.

The bioactive agent can be a mixture of active agents, e.g. a drug and an antibody, or any effective combination of one or more bioactive agents that can work together or independently at the site of implantation to effect positive biological activity. The bioactive agent may be delivered in a microsphere encapsulating e.g. a viral vector having a gene for expression at the site of implantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The bioactive agent can comprise a tissue adhesion factor and the tissue adhesion factor is selected from the group consisting of fibrin, collagen, albumin, cyanoacrylate, fibrinogen, chitosan, and gelatin-genipin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Synthesis or formulation of a bioactive agent selected can be facilitated generally as is practiced with the agent in laboratory or medicinal contexts, e.g. as demonstrated in standard or published protocols and assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also comprise a radio pacifier. The radio pacifier can comprise an agent that provides visibility of the device under X-ray or other imaging technology such as CT scans, MRIs and flouroscopy. The radio pacifier permits the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be monitored and detected once inside the patient. The radio pacifier can comprise, for example, a contrast media or a metal powder, but is not limited to these items. The metal powder can be, for example, titanium, tungsten, gold, bismuth, barium sulfate or tantalum powder. Additionally, the radio pacifier includes a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent.

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the coil <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is delivered to the surgeon, other practitioner or attendant in pre-cut or pre-formed lengths. In this embodiment, each coil is cut to a predetermined length. For example, the length of the coil <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as it is delivered can be in the range from about 1 mm to about 5 meters. In a preferred embodiment, the pre-cut lengths of the coils <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for delivery to the patient can be in a range from about 1 mm to about 10 mm. In an embodiment, the dimensions of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be from about 0.125 mm to about 12.50 mm, or the outside diameter of objects suitable for passing through a delivery device to a site of abnormal bleeding.

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having pre-implantation shape and then a vaso-occluding shape can be delivered to the site of abnormal blood flow e.g. by a catheter or pushing device having a lumen for delivering the vaso-occlusive device. The vaso-occlusive device can also be delivered e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,069; USPN 5,304,194; USPN 5,423,849; USPN 5,522,822; USPN 5,549,624; Mariant USPN 5,639,277; USPN 5,658,308; USPN 5,669,931; USPN 5,690,667; USPN 5,733,329; USPN 5,766,160; USPN 5,957,948; USPN 6,168,592; USPN 5,826,587; USPN 5,957,948; USPN 6,024,754, or USPN 6,033,423. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, in an embodiment, the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is deliverable as a liquid injectable material to the site of abnormal bleeding where the liquid polymerizes to a solid or precipitates into a vaso-occluding shape as a solid to occlude the abnormal blood flow. The liquid injectable material can include one or more of the natural or non-natural polymer discussed above. The liquid injectable material may also comprise one or more of the bioactive agent also discussed above. As the biodegradable polymer degrades, the bioactive agent is released at the site of implantation to promote whatever bioactivity the agent is capable of. The liquid injectable can also comprises a radio pacifier as described earlier. One or more polymers comprising the liquid injectable material can also be biodegradable after implantation in the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,012 describes a process usable with the present invention by which proteins and other bioactive agents can be incorporated into a polymer during a forming process such as extrusion, molding or casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,348 describes production of novel polymers using recombinant techniques, and also integration of bioactive agents potentially useful at a site of implantation in the patient. This production can be used with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention also comprises a method of treating a patient having abnormal blood flow at a particular site in the body. The device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a pre-implantation shape that changes to a post-implantation vaso-occluding shape can be delivered as described above. Alternatively, the device formed of a liquid injectable material can be delivered as described above. The liquid injectable material as described above can be injected into the site of abnormal blood flow so that it will polymerize or precipitate there, and promote subsequent blood flow occlusion. The method can further include that the material implanted comprises a bioactive agent, such as, for example, those listed herein. The method can also further comprise that the injected or implanted non-metal polymeric material biodegrades in the patient. Thus, one or more polymers that make up the solid material can biodegrade in the patient. Material that does not biodegrade can remain in the patient as a matrix or framework for blood flow occlusion and other biological responses such as healing and rebuilding normal vasculature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> used in the method is designed for implantation into the vasculature of a patient. The implantation site can be any site of abnormal blood flow in the patient. The abnormal blood flow can be caused by an aneurysm, a ruptured blood vessel, an arterio venous malformation (AVM), fistula, or a benign or malignant tumor. Tumors are in part characterized by a highly vascularized state. Otherwise untreatable tumors are particularly contemplated for treatment by implantation of the vaso-occlusive device of the invention. Use of a radio pacifier in the device provides the opportunity to image and locate the device at a later date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the invention embodies a method of making the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as described above. That method includes configuring a non-metal material (which, as discussed above, can be one polymer or a blend, or copolymer of two or more polymers) into a pre-implantation shape. The pre-implantation shape configures into a vaso-occluding, generally more complicated shape, e.g. a coil becomes a coiled coil or a tangled coil, etc. An example of forming a pre-implantation structure using a polymer is described in Pathak, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,871. The materials used in the making of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be the same natural and non-natural polymers listed above, and the like, and also the material is not limited to these selections. One or more of the polymers comprising the material can be biodegradable. Bioactive agents listed herein and the like (and not limited to these) can be integrated into the biodegradable material, for release after the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is implanted, and possibly during biodegradation of the device. Methods of making the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprising a liquid injectable material will comprise formulating the liquid injectable polymer or plastic and optionally incorporating into the liquid composition a bioactive agent. The mixture will be injected into the patient where it polymerizes to a solid or precipitates to a solid, occludes abnormal blood flow, and optionally subsequently degrades. The material can also further comprises a radio pacifier, as described herein. </paragraph>
