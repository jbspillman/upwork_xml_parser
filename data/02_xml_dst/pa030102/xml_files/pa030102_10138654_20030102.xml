<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an immunochemical assay and method for qualitative or quantitative detection of analytes in biological fluids. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Antibodies are protein molecules which specifically bind antigens that initiate the formation of the antibodies. Antibodies are produced by B-lymphocytes and plasma cells, and are present in blood plasma (as secretory antibodies or cell bound), lymphatic fluids, cerebrospinal fluid, mucus and other extracellular secretions (e.g., saliva), and in some instances, urine. Assays for antibodies have been widely applied to the examination and diagnosis of many infections, and autoimmune and allergic conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are currently several known immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD. These immunoglobulins are involved in different types of immune responses, and their involvements are dependent, for example, on antigen structures, type of organisms which bear these antigens, time after immunization, and presence of other antigenic molecules in the microorganisms. It is believed that antibody classes important for serological testing and secretory immunoglobulins contain two or more identical antigen-combining sites. In particular, it is believed that there are two sites for IgG and IgE, four for IgA, and up to 10 for IgM. This mean that at least two antigen molecules or specific antigenic (epitopic) substances can bind simultaneously to one antibody molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that affinity of antibodies to specific antigens may not be constant. Beside the spectrum of polyclonal antibodies which can differ in affinity at varying stages of an immune response depending on the particular pathogen/immunogen, affinity of antibodies can change with time, from low to high affinity, for instance, during the antibody maturation process. Moreover, several antibody classes can simultaneously recognize the same antigen. In the case of bacterial, viral, protozoan, parasitic, or fungal infection, the IgM class can appear at the early stages of an immune response, usually as antibody with a low affinity constant, while the IgG class can appear later in the immune response. For serological testing of many infections, the ability to detect antibodies at the earliest stages of seroconversion can be very important in determining a treatment. Because the IgM class antibodies often appear during the early stages of infection, their presence is often considered as a serological indication of early stage of infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Antibodies can be detected using a variety of immunoassay protocols. Among conventional methods, the most widely used works on principles of solid phase immunoassay using immobilized antigens and secondary class-specific anti-immunoglobulins conjugated with detector labels, such as, enzyme, fluorophores, chemiluminescent, metal sols, dyed polymeric particles, or labeled proteins which bind to immunoglobulins (protein A and G). A disadvantage of such a method is that a falsely positive result can be obtained due to non-specific and cross-reactive reactions related to simple adsorption of non-specific antibodies on coated solid phase, or the presence of unwanted antigenic substances in antigens used for adsorption on solid phase. This can happen even in case of using relatively pure antigens obtained by methods of recombinant technology. Moreover, the presence of, for instance, autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor, or polyspecific/polyreactive antibodies, can lead to false results. Even in case of using very specific small peptide antigens, false positives can arise as result of contaminations in the reagents used for immobilization on solid phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce the occurrence of false positives, steps, such as, selection of sample dilution, incubation time, temperature, and diluents used, have been taken to reduce potential cross-reactive reactions. However, such steps can require the application of many serological tests and can reduce detection sensitivity. For example, in a solid phase immunoassay using solid phase immobilized antigens, the presence of conjugates antigen-specific antibodies with detector label can compete with antibodies in a sample to be detected to bind with the immobilized antigens. As a result, although this competitive test is relatively simple and may be less susceptible to non-specific reactions, its sensitivity for detection can be relatively low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another immunoassay for specific antibody detection based on competitive binding, a specific antibody may be immobilized in a solid phase. However, during incubation, labeled antigens in the sample and the antibody to be detected in the sample can compete to bind with the immobilized antibody. As with the previous example, sensitivity of detection may be affected due to competitive binding, and as a result, may require a significant amount of pure anti-antigen antibodies for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another immunoassay, the solid phase may be coated with a class specific immunoglobulins. Labeled antigens may be used in the sample of the antibody to be detected to form an immune complex with the class specific immunoglobulins in the solid phase. One disadvantage of this immunoassay is the limited binding capacity of the class specific immunoglobulins in the solid phase, which can limit the sensitivity of specific antibody detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further variation of solid phase immunoassay involves the use of solid phase coated antigens to capture specific antibody and subsequent detection of captured/bound antibody with a labeled antigen. However, a prozoning phenomenon may be a problem for this approach. In particular, the density of antigen on solid phase should be carefully optimized to protect the antibody from binding with the solid phase antigen through all combining sites (e.g., IgG class) on the antibody, which reduce number of sites available on the antibody to bind with labeled antigen. A second incubation with labeled antigen is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,006 as a way for increasing sensitivity of this type of assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,770 discloses a method for antibody detection using labeled antigen and a solid phase capture system. In this method, the solid phase comprises immobilized antigens and anti-immunoglobulin antibodies introduced into the capture system through an additional bridge. The bridge, as disclosed, includes analyte-specific antibodies capable of recognizing ligand-labeled anti-species class specific antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,778,751 discloses a method for detection of circulating antibodies, which method is based on the use of a ligand-labeled polymeric matrix. In this method, the matrix is conjugated with multiple antigen molecules, a ligand-binding partner immobilized on solid phase, and anti-immunoglobuline detector reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,042, a three reagents antibody detection system is disclosed. The detection system, as disclosed, comprises two components of a specific binding pair. One component is included in the capture system as a conjugate of StrAv with thermo polymerized BSA of anti-immunoglobulin antibodies, while the second component is conjugated to the antigen. A third reagent is labeled and is a conjugate of the antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,849 discloses a detection method utilizing an antigen containing simultaneously two different labels belonging to two affinity pairs, each with its counterparts distributed between separate solid phases. This approach permits for significant reduction of non-specific reaction by using immune-complex transfer (dissociation-recapture) for detection in a second container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Lyphophilic bridges, such as liposomes or some other reversible bridge, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,312,730 and 5,705,338 as a way to dissociate an immune complex from a first solid phase to permit transfer into a second solid phase for detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Small peptide antigens, containing specific epitopes, mono or limited amount, can be powerful instrument for development of highly specific serological test. The role of these peptides, whether obtained by chemical synthesis or recombinant technology, have become increasingly important. However, affinity of antibodies against these small epitopes is sometimes lower than the affinity to a sequence in whole protein. Moreover, affinity of antibodies to selected peptide antigens can vary due to the presence of various strains of pathogens and its genetic variability. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide simple methods, which can permit the detection of antibodies that may have low affinity to selected epitopes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a simple heterogeneous immunoassay for detection of antibodies based on specific antigen-antibody immune complex formation with dually labeled antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention provides methods for detection of antibodies against peptide epitopes and haptens or detection of other analytes with multiple identical binding epitopes. In this manner, the method of the present invention can permit detection of, for example, multiple antibody classes in one sample, including antibody with a low affinity constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention provides a simplified method for sample preparation, thereby allowing the assays being carried out to be insensitive to sample dilution, while eliminating factors which can lead to various non-specific reactions and false positives frequently seen in conventional serological tests using anti-immunoglobulin conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can be used in a variety of assay formats, including ELISA, dot-blot, flow-through (e.g., immunoconcentration and immunofiltration), and lateral flow, including the possibility for quantitative determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment, the present provides a method for detecting an antibody that binds to an antigen or hapten in a sample. The method includes providing a first component having a ligand linked to a solid phase adsorbing composition through a chemical spacer. In an embodiment, the ligand may be biotin, the solid phase adsorbing composition may be albumin and the spacer may be polyethylene glycol. Also provided is a second component having a ligand-binding moiety and the antigen or hapten that binds the antibody. The ligand-binding moiety in an embodiment can be avidin or streptavidin. A third component can be provided comprising an antigen or hapten and a label. The label, in an embodiment, may be one of the following, an enzyme, a fluorescent probe, a chemiluminescent probe, a metal, a non-metal colloidal particle, a polymeric dye particle, and a pigment molecule. The method permits contacting the first component with a solid phase, so as to immobilize the first component. Subsequently, the antibody sample is contacted with the first, second and third components to allow the third component to form an immune complex with the first and second components by binding to the second component through the antibody present in the antibody sample. Thereafter, uncomplexed third component may be separated from the solid phase and the label present in the immune complex may be detected. The detection of the label indicates the presence of the antibody in the antibody sample, and thus the detection of the antibody in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides, in one embodiment, a composition of matter comprising a ligand linked to a solid phase adsorbing composition through a chemical spacer. In an embodiment, the ligand may be biotin, the solid phase adsorbing composition may be albumin and the spacer may be polyethylene glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides, in an embodiment, a kit comprising a first component having a ligand linked to a solid phase adsorbing composition through a chemical spacer. The kit also includes a second component having a ligand-binding moiety and the antigen or hapten that binds the antibody, and a third component comprising an antigen or hapten and a label. The kit can further include an antibody standard.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, in one embodiment, an immunochemical method and reagents for qualitative or quantitative detection of analytes in biological fluids, including detection of antibodies to small antigens, epitopes, peptides or haptens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present method, in one embodiment, can be based on the ability of an antibody to bind at least two molecules of the same antigenic substance, due to the presence of at least two specific, substantially identical antigen-binding sites on the antibody. For instance, the IgG class has two identical binding sites, while the IgM class has up to 10 identical binding sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The principle of antibody detection in the present assay involves formation in solution of a specific immune complex between the antibody to be detected and two molecules of antigen/hapten bearing two different labels. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, one molecule <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of antigen/hapten may be conjugated with a detector label <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, while a second molecule <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be conjugated to a component <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of a high-affinity pair (e.g., biotin-streptavidin) that allows specific capture of the ternary immune complex <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> thus formed onto a solid phase <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> coated with the other component <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the affinity pair. The two conjugates <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be added as a mixture to the sample being analyzed. In principle, one conjugate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can bind to one antigen-binding site of the antibody molecule <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> to be detected, while the second conjugate <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can bind to the other antigen-binding site on the same antibody molecule <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. Ternary complex <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> thus formed is bound to the solid phase <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> via the specific interaction of the second conjugate <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and its associated partner <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the affinity pair with the other affinity partner <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> immobilized on the solid phase <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. An appropriate detection method (enzymatic or other) can then be applied to detect binding of the antibody-antigen complex. A single washing step may be needed to remove excess reagent prior to quantitation of bound detector label. Most known types of labels (enzymatic, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, colloidal gold, other colloids, colored particles etc.) used in various immunoassays can be utilized in tests based on this principle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the detection principle employ by the present invention may be applicable to various test formats. For example, it can be shown that the same reagents used for creation of a microplate C6 ELISA can function effectively in membrane ELISA formats, including rapid tests (performed in 5-10 min), in which sensitivity equal to or higher than that of the microplate ELISA format was demonstrated. Moreover, the present method can also be useful in antibody detection using rapid immunofiltration and immunochromatographic assay techniques while exhibiting very low background and non-specific reactions. The method of the present invention may also be especially suitable for application in immunochromatographic serological tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present method, in accordance with an embodiment, can be substantially free from most interfering factors related to cross-reactivity problems, can work effectively with undiluted serum/plasma samples, can provide extremely low signal for normal samples, and has significantly higher analytical sensitivity. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity may also be increased with the present method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Assay protocols for use with the present invention can be relatively simple and more convenient, with short turn-around time. For instance, an entire test can be performed within 30 minutes. The need for sample dilution may also be eliminated, as undiluted sample and conjugates can be mixed directly in wells of a coated plate, followed by a single wash step. As such, testing of multiple samples can be especially convenient because of the insensitivity of results to prolonged incubation between additions of sample and conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, a broad range of linearity of absorbance (OD) values, covering almost the full scale of a typical ELISA reader in optimized assay conditions may be achieved with a method of the present invention, making such method valuable for quantitative determination of anti-peptide antibody concentration. For instance, the detection limit for IgG antibody using the method of the present invention with HRP label and commercially available tetramethylbenzidene (TMB)-based chromogenic substrates can be as low as 5 ng/ml in a 30 min test. The low background and low non-specific reactivity makes the method of the present invention suitable for further application of various signal amplification techniques for antibody detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method of the present invention provides, in one embodiment, an assay that is not species-dependent. Specifically, detection of antibodies against a specific antigen can be applied, without special modifications, for detection of antibodies in human, as well as animal sera/plasma. Moreover, the present method can, in an embodiment, detect antibody classes involved in the humoral immune response (e.g., IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE), such that analysis of the antibody class involved in specific immune complex formation with the labeled antigen can be done as a second step using appropriate secondary conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In general, the present method allows for increased sensitivity of detection of antibody classes that have more than two binding sites for antigens, for instance, IgM pentamer or IgA dimer. As such, the present method can narrow the &ldquo;window period&rdquo; for serological detection of infection due to more sensitive detection of IgM antibodies during the early phase of seroconversion. In addition, the present method can be valuable for detection of secretory IgA antibodies in various secretions containing the first line of humoral antimicrobial defense (e.g., saliva, intestinal, respiratory, erythema, gastrointestinal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present method permits an application of new immune complex-forming reagents for quantitative detection of an antigen (e.g., VlsE protein). Sensitivity of better than 1 ng/ml can be attained using a version of the new test in combination with anti-C6 peptide antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments, the present invention takes advantage of the ability of all natural antibodies to bind at least two identical molecules of antigens by binding one antigen or hapten though each of the two arms of the immunoglobulin structure. In preferred embodiments the invention utilizes two basic types of peptide antigen conjugates which are recruited into a specific immune complex by the antibody to be detected. The resulting immune complex may be selectively captured on a solid phase without interference from even a large excess of non-specific immunoglobulins present in sample. The presence of a detector label on one of the two peptide antigen conjugates allows for the detection and, in certain embodiments, the quantitation of the specific immune complex, which is proportionate to the amount of specific peptide-binding antibody that is present in the test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the first peptide is conjugated directly or indirectly to a detector label by means known in the art so that the structure of the epitope recognized by the antibody is retained (for example, a selected functional group may be attached to one the terminal aminoacids). This conjugate is herein referred to as the third component or the third conjugate component of the immunassay or of the present invention. The second peptide conjugate according to the present invention is the peptide conjugated directly or indirectly to partner of bioaffinity pair (i.e. to a ligand-binding moiety or the ligand to which it binds-preferably with a high affinity). In preferred embodiments this high affinity binding partner has a higher mol weight than its functional (affinity) counterpart. This conjugate of the peptide to the component of the bioaffinity pair is herein referred to as the second component or the second conjugate component of the immunassay of the present invention. These conjugates should preserve functional activity of both biologically active components&mdash;i.e. of both the antigenic antibody-binding activity of the peptide as well as the binding activity of the bioaffinity partner. The third component of the system participating in specific antibody detection is a conjugate of the second component of the bioaffinity pair (i.e. a ligand where a ligand-binding moiety is incorporated into the second component and a ligand-binding moiety where a ligand is incorporated into the second component) with a macromolecular carrier which can be (or has been) immobilized on a solid phase. The invention teaches the preparation of a multiplicity of reagents of the capture system which provide efficient adsorption of reagent on various types of solid phases with high binding capacity for labeled specific immune complex. The effect of the presence of components of the bioaffinity partners in human blood (e.g. samples containing immunoglobulins where the bioaffinity partners are antibody and antigen) also has been estimated. Factors important for quantitative determinations of specific antibodies, high dose hook effect (prozoning), linearity of dependence antibody concentration-signal are also provided by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The invention provides means for optimizing the efficiency of antibody detection by determining the affinity of the antibody to be detected or measured by methods (as compared with conventional methods using solid phase immobilized peptides). In preferred embodiments, the invention includes methods that preferably include: optimization of peptide conjugates in respect of amount of peptides in each type of conjugates (as a molar ratio); optimization of the distribution of peptide between two types of conjugates; and optimization of their final concentrations in the final immunoassay. The efficacy of solid phase immunoassay is based on high local concentrations of analytes (e.g. antibodies and antigens) associated with adsorption on solid phase&mdash;which promotes the immunological antigen-antibody reaction through the law of mass action. Special approaches are known in the art for preparation of peptide antigens and their adsorption on a solid phase which increase concentration of peptides on solid phase (polymers with multiple peptides , peptides with repeating epitopic sequence ets). Frequently used approaches for peptide immobilization are based on the use of Streptavidin (StrAv) and biotinylated peptide, which theoretically permit for formation of immobilized complexes containing up to four peptides in a single immobilized complex. The Biotin/Streptavidin/Avidin/Antibiotin bioaffinity systems currently available are provide the most versatile system with various applications in area of bioanalytical and diagnostic detection system. The high affinity and specificity of biotin-streptavidin interaction, stability of StrAv , presence of four biotin-binding sites, commercial availability of reagents contribute to making this system the preferred one among bioaffinity pairs available. This system was utilized in the method of the instant invention as a preferred system for demonstrating the advantages of the invention. Typically, StrAv is used as solid-phase immobilized reagent as component for immobilization of biotin-labeled specific ligands or additional components of detection system participating in specific capture of analytes, while biotin is typically used for the labeling of specific or supplementary analytes and detector labels. In contrast, the present invention demonstrates the advantages of reversing these roles of StrAv and biotin counterparts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The development of a test system for detection of antibodies against two peptide antigens is important for, for example, serological diagnosis of Lyme disease. The invention provides methods for the detection of different types of immune responses. For example, one antigen peptide characteristic of Lyme disease is peptide C6, representing a conservative region of one of the variable domains of VLSe of <highlight><italic>B. burgdorferi</italic></highlight>. C6 is known as an epitope which elicit primarily IgG response, typical seroconversion from IgM to IgG response has not been found for this peptide, although IgM components can be detected (see, e.g., Liang F. T at al. (1999) J.Clin.Microbiol. 37:3990-3996). The second peptide, C10 representing an immunogenic C-terminal epitope of OspC protein of <highlight><italic>B. burgdorferi </italic></highlight>is known as an epitope which results in a persistent IgM response at all stages of disease without typical IgM-IgG switching. The C10 peptide is considered to be antigen which, if detected, can improve the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis of early <highlight><italic>Lyme borreliosis </italic></highlight>(see Mathiesen M. J. et al. (1998) J.Clin.Microbiol. 36:3474-3479). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Both peptides C6 and C10 modified at N-terminal with biotin and immobilized on solid phase through StrAv bridge work well as antigens in conventional assays using anti-human IgG/IgM enzyme conjugates. Covalent conjugates of both peptides through N-terminal Cys with maleimide activated BSA as described in Examples also function well as reagents for immobilization on solid phase. Cross-reactive results have been found, however, for some sera samples related to the presence of antigenic substances on the solid phase not related to the specific peptide epitopes. The method of the invention provides an additional test for analysis of specificity of the immunoassay signal based on inhibition of signal using addition of an excess of non-modified pure peptide to diluted sera samples before transferring into antigen coated wells. Applied to the Lyme antigens, this approach has shown that C6 peptide can inhibit very efficiently specific signals at very low concentration, but C10 can not. This phenomenon was examined through the method of the invention by analysis of inhibitory activity of various peptide-BSA and peptide-StrAv conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In general the method of the invention provides an immunoassay which provides unique compositions, but also utilizes components and methodologies used in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,778,751, 4,945,042, 5,236,849, 5,312,730, 5,705,338, 5,989,806, 6,030,770 and 6,121,006, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, provide standard methodologies and reagents for use in the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;label&rdquo; is any molecule, which produces or can be induced to produce a signal. The label may be conjugated to an analyte or an antibody, or to another molecule such as a receptor or a molecule that can bind to a receptor such as a ligand, particularly a hapten. In the subject invention, the label can be a member of the signal producing system, as defined below, that includes a signal producing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The label may be isotopic or nonisotopic, preferably nonisotopic. By way of example and not limitation, the label can be a part of a catalytic reaction system such as enzymes, enzyme fragments, enzyme substrates, enzyme inhibitors, coenzymes, or catalysts; part of a chromogen system such as fluorophores, dyes, chemiluminescers, luminescers, or sensitizers; a dispersible particle that can be non-magnetic or magnetic, a solid support, a liposome, a ligand, a receptor, a hapten radioactive isotope, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Enzymes, enzyme fragments, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme substrates, and other components of enzyme reaction systems can be used as labels. Where any of these components is used as a label, a chemical reaction involving one of the components is part of the signal producing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When enzymes are employed, molecular weights of the label typically range from about 10,000 to 600,000, more usually from about 10,000 to 300,000, and the involved reactions will be, for the most part, hydrolysis or redox reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Coupled catalysts can also involve an enzyme with a non-enzymatic catalyst. The enzyme can produce a reactant, which undergoes a reaction catalyzed by the non-enzymatic catalyst or the non-enzymatic catalyst may produce a substrate (includes coenzymes) for the enzyme. A wide variety of non-enzymatic catalysts, which may be employed are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,160,645 (1979), the appropriate portions of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The enzyme or coenzyme employed provides the desired amplification by producing a product, which absorbs light, e.g., a dye, or emits light upon irradiation, e.g., a fluorescer. Alternatively, the catalytic reaction can lead to direct light emission, e.g., chemiluminescence. A large number of enzymes and coenzymes for providing such products are indicated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149, columns 19 to 23, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,980, columns 10 to 14, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A number of enzyme combinations are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149, columns 23 to 28, which combinations can find use in the subject invention. This disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Of particular interest are enzymes, which involve the production of hydrogen peroxide and the use of the hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor to a dye. Particular combinations include saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose and galactose oxidase, or heterocyclic oxidases, such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme which employs the hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor, that is, a peroxidase such as horse radish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase. Additional enzyme combinations may be found in the subject matter incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When a single enzyme is used as a label, such enzymes that may find use are hydrolases, transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases or synthetases and oxidoreductases, preferably, hydrolases. Alternatively, luciferases may be used such as firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase. Primarily, the enzymes of choice, based on the I.U.B. classification are: Class 1. oxidoreductases and Class 3. Hydrolases; particularly in Class 1, the enzymes of interest are dehydrogenases of Class 1.1, more particularly 1.1.1, 1.1.3, and 1.1.99 and peroxidases, in Class 1.11. Of the hydrolases, particularly Class 3.1, more particularly 3.1.3 and Class 3.2, more particularly 3.2.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Illustrative dehydrogenases include malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Of the oxidases, glucose oxidase is exemplary. Of the peroxidases, horse radish peroxidase is illustrative. Of the hydrolases, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and lysozyme are illustrative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Those enzymes, which employ nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or its phosphate (NADP) as a cofactor, particularly the former, can be used. One preferred enzyme is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, preferably, NAD-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The label can also be fluorescent either directly or by virtue of fluorescent compounds or fluorescers bound to a particle or other molecule in conventional ways. The fluorescent labels will be bound to, or functionalized to render them capable of binding (being conjugated) to, optionally through a linking group, cyclosporin or antibodies or receptors for cyclosporin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The fluorescers of interest will generally emit light at a wavelength above about 350 nm, usually above about 400 nm and preferably above about 450 nm. Desirably, the fluorescers have a high quantum efficiency, a large Stokes shift, and are chemically stable under the conditions of their conjugation and use. The term luminescent label is intended to include substances that emit light upon activation by electromagnetic radiation, electro chemical excitation, or chemical activation and includes fluorescent and phosphorescent substances, scintillators, and chemiluminescent substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Fluorescers of interest fall into a variety of categories having certain primary functionalities. These primary functionalities include 1- and 2-aminonaphthalene, p,p-diaminostilbenes, pyrenes, quaternary phenanthridine salts, 9-aminoacridines, p,p&prime;-diaminostilbenes imines, anthracenes, oxacarboxyanine, merocyanine, 3-aminoequilenin, perylene, bis-benzoxazole, bis-p-oxazolyl benzene, 1,2-benzophenazine, retinol, bis-3-aminopyridinium salts, hellebrigenin, tetracycline, sterophenol, benzimidazolylphenylamine, 2-oxo-3-chromen, indole, xanthene, 7-hydroxycoumarin, 4,5-benzimidazoles, phenoxazine, salicylate, strophanthidin, porphyrins, triarylmethanes, flavin and rare earth chelates, oxides, and salts. Exemplary fluorescers are enumerated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,707, columns 7 and 8, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Energy absorbers or quenchers can be employed either separately or in conjunction with one another. The absorber or quencher can additionally be bound to a solid insoluble particle of at least about 50 nm in diameter. When the distance between the absorber and the quencher resulting from specific binding events (such as antibody-antigen binding) too small, the fluorescence of the absorber is quenched by the quencher. The quencher may be the same or different, usually different, from the fluorescer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> An alternative source of light as a detectable signal is a chemiluminescent source, and, therefore, a label can be a chemiluminescent compound. The chemiluminescent source involves a compound, which becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which serves as the detectable signal or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A diverse number of families of compounds have been found to provide chemiluminescence under a variety of conditions. One family of compounds is 2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione. The most popular compound is luminol, which is the 5-amino analog of the above compound. Other members of the family include the 5-amino-6,7,8-trimethoxy- and the dimethylamine-&lsqb;ca&rsqb;benzo analog. These compounds can be made to luminesce with alkaline hydrogen peroxide or calcium hypochlorite and base. Another family of compounds is the 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoles, with lophine as the common name for the parent product. Chemiluminescent analogs include para-dimethylamino- and para-methoxy-substituents. Chemiluminescence may also be obtained with geridinium esters, dioxetanes, and oxalates, usually oxalyl active esters, e.g., p-nitrophenyl and a peroxide, e.g., hydrogen peroxide, under basic conditions. Alternatively, luciferins may be used in conjunction with luciferase or lucigenins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Conjugate&mdash;A conjugate is a molecule comprised of two or more subunits bound together, optionally through a linking group, to form a single structure. The binding can be made either by a direct connection (e.g. a chemical bond) between the subunits or by use of a linking group. For example, in one context of the present invention, a peptide antigen is conjugated, optionally through a linking group, a detectable label. In a second context, the peptide antigen is conjugated to a member of a high-affinity binding pair (i.e. preferably a ligand-binding moiety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Conjugation&mdash;Conjugation is any process wherein two subunits are linked together to form a conjugate. The conjugation process can be comprised of any number of steps. </paragraph>

These organized areas of a molecule are referred to as epitopic or determinant sites. Illustrative naturally occurring receptors include antibodies, enzymes, fab fragments, poly(nucleic acids), complement component, i.e. thyroxine binding globulin, lectins, protein A, and the like. Receptors are also referred to as antiligands. A natural receptor exists that binds specifically to cyclosporin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Ligand&mdash;A ligand is any organic molecule for which a receptor naturally exists or can be prepared. For example biotin is a high-affinity ligand which binds to avidin (or strepavidin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Hapten&mdash;Haptens are capable of binding specifically to corresponding antibodies, but do not themselves act as immunogens (or antigens) for preparation of the antibodies. Antibodies which recognize a hapten can be prepared against compounds comprised of the hapten linked to an immunogenic (or antigenic) carrier. Haptens are a subset of ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Member of a specific binding pair&mdash;A member of a specific binding pair (sbp member) is one of two different molecules, having an area on the surface or in a cavity, which specifically binds to and is thereby defined as complementary with a particular spatial and polar organization of the other molecule. The members of the specific binding pair are referred to as ligand and receptor (antiligand). For example, avidin and biotin form a preferred specific binding pair. The specific binding pair may also be members of an immunological pair such as antigen-antibody, although other specific binding pairs, such as biotin-avidin, hormones-hormone receptors, nucleic acid duplexes, IgG-protein A, DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and the like, are not immunological pairs but are specific binding pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A solid phase (or support or surface)&mdash;A solid phase is a porous or non-porous water insoluble material.

Natural or synthetic assemblies such as liposomes, phospholipid vesicles, and cells can also be employed. Other materials, which can be employed, are described above in the definition of immunogenic carrier particles and below in the definition of a signal producing system. Other preferred solid phase membrane materials are described below in the examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The binding of members to the support or surface may be accomplished by well-known techniques, commonly available in the literature, and described above in the definition of immunogenic carrier particles. The surface can have any one of a number of shapes, such as strip, rod, particle, including bead, and the like. The surface will usually be polyfunctional or be capable of being polyfunctionalized or be capable of binding an sbp member through specific or non-specific covalent or non-covalent interactions. A wide variety of functional groups for linking are described in the definition of immunogenic carrier particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The length of a linking group or chemical linker&rdquo; to the peptide antigen or ligand may vary widely, depending upon the nature of the compound being linked, the effect of the distance between the compound being linked and the support on the assay and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Signal producing system&mdash;The function of the signal producing system is to produce a product, which provides a detectable signal related to the amount of bound and/or unbound label. The signal producing system may have one or more components, at least one component being a label. The signal producing system includes all of the reagents required to produce a measurable signal including signal producing means capable of interacting with the label to produce a signal. The signal producing system provides a signal detectable by external means, normally by measurement of electromagnetic radiation, desirably by visual examination. For the most part, the signal producing system includes a chromophoric substrate and enzyme, where chromophoric substrates are enzymatically converted to dyes, which absorb light in the ultraviolet or visible region, phosphors, or fluorescers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The signal producing means is capable of interacting with the label to produce a detectable signal. Such means include, for example, electromagnetic radiation, heat, chemical reagents, and the like. Where chemical reagents are employed, some of the chemical reagents can be included as part of a developer solution. The chemical reagents can include substrates, coenzymes, enhancers, second enzymes, activators, cofactors, inhibitors, scavengers, metal ions, specific binding substances required for binding of signal generating substances, and the like. Some of the chemical reagents such as coenzymes, substances that react with enzymic products, other enzymes and catalysts, and the like can be bound to other molecules or to a support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The signal producing system including the label can include one or more particles, which are insoluble particles of at least about 50 nm and not more than about 50 microns, usually at least about 100 nm and less than about 25 microns, preferably from about 0.2 to 5 microns, diameter. The particle may be organic or inorganic, porous or non-porous, preferably of a density approximating water, generally from about 0.7 to about 1.5 g/mL, and composed of material that can be transparent, partially transparent, or opaque. Generally, particles utilized as a label will have similar characteristics to those described above in the definitions of an immunogenic carrier and a support or surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Many different types of particles may be employed for modulating light emission. Of particular interest are carbon particles, such as charcoal, lamp black, graphite, colloidal carbon and the like. Besides carbon particles metal sols may also find use, particularly of the noble metals, gold, silver, and platinum. Other metal-derived particles may include metal sulfides, such as lead, silver, or copper sulfides or metal oxides, such as iron or copper oxide. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies were isolated (Example 6) from two different patient sera pools&mdash;one from patients with late Lyme disease, which contained only IgG antibodies against the C6 peptide, and the second from patients at early stage of Lyme disease containing both IgG and IgM classes of antibodies against C6 and C10 peptides. Affinity purification was conducted according to conventional ELISA test with solid-phase immobilized peptides (see Example 13). A series of C6-BSA, C10-BSA, C6-StrAv and C10-StrAv conjugates at various ratios of peptide/BSA (from 1:1 to 8:1) have been synthesized and tested for inhibitory activity for IgG and IgM antibodies in preparations of affinity purified anti C6 and anti-C10 antibodies (see Examples 7 and 14). Table 1 below illustrates the differences in inhibitory activity (which reflects affinity) seen with non-conjugated peptides and with peptides having various molar ratios of peptide/BSA as well as the source of the antibody&mdash;i.e. early or late stage of disease.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The binding of anti-C6 IgG antibodies isolated from late serum with solid-phase immobilized peptide inhibited with almost equal efficiency to non-conjugated C6 peptide and all C6-BSA conjugates. For anti-C6 antibodies isolated from serum of patient at early stage of Lyme disease inhibitory activity (affinity) of non-conjugated C6 peptide and C6-BSA conjugates differ significantly. There was a direct relationship between the amount of peptide in BSA conjugates and its activity as an inhibitors of IgG and IgM anti-C6 antibody activity in solution. Even more significant is the difference between non-conjugated peptide and BSA-C10 conjugates in inhibition of IgG and IgM anti-C10 antibodies. Almost three order of magnitude difference between the concentration of non-conjugated C10 and C10-BSA 8:1 conjugate was required to reduce the binding of anti-C10 antibodies by 50% in solution with solid-phase immobilized peptide. These results demonstrate that, optimally, more than one peptide should be present in peptide conjugates to optimize binding in solution with specific anti-peptide antibodies having low affinity to peptide epitopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In contrast, for the formation of complexes with high affinity antibodies one peptide in the peptide conjugate may be enough (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Conjugates of C6 and C10 peptides with detector label (HRP) were prepared two ways. First, conjugates containing 1 or less molecules of peptide per HRP molecule were prepared by direct reaction of Cys-peptides with maleimide activated HRP (see Examples 7 and 8). HRP does not have enough amino groups to introduce more maleimide groups conveniently. Conjugates of peptide-HRP with more than one peptide were prepared by conjugation of peptide-BSA conjugates having reactive maleimide groups with thyolated HRP, prepared as described in Example 4. The presence of approximately one SH groups in HRP in this case favors formation of conjugates without cross-linking problem. Conjugates containing up to 4.5 HRP molecules per one peptide_BSA-maleimide were prepared (Example 8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As a major component of solid phase capture system the current invention describes biotinylated BSA where biotin is attached to BSA through a PEG spacer with MW3500 (Example 5). Biotechnical and biomedical application of PEG is known in the art &lsqb;see, e.g., Poly(ethylene glycol) chemistry Ed by J. M.Harris, Plenum Press, New York,1992&rsqb;. The characteristics of PEG which favor its use as a spacer or linker for use in the present invention include its: hydrophilic characteristics, absence of charge, flexibility, stabilizing effect on proteins, and reduction of immunogenic properties of proteins. Accordingly, Bi-PEG-BSA is versatile reagent for adsorption on various solid phases, polystirol plates, NC and other membranes in this invention (in which high binding capacity to biotin-binding proteins and reduced non-specific adsorption effect are optimal). Bi-PEG-BSA provides enhanced affinity to the solid phase, stable adsorption, and can be applied at a concentration which may be enough for simultaneously efficient blocking of the solid phase, thereby eliminating requirement for secondary blocking reagents. As a result, the procedure for preparation of coated devices become very simple and inexpensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one of embodiments of this invention the application of PEG-modified streptavidin is described in the examples which follow. The PEG-modified streptavidin may be used to enhance adsorption on various solid phases with reduced NSB reactions. StrAv, modified through amino groups with PNC activated StrAv MW 5000 has enhanced and stable adsorption on polystirol plates and NC membranes, non-specific adsorption of immunoglobulins from sera samples was also reduced and potential immunogenic epitopes on streptavidin also appear to be sheltered. Another application of PEG-modified StrAv, where effect of modification is very pronounced is adsorption on colloidal gold particles. PEG-StrAv contrary to non-modified StrAv adsorbs on colloidal particles at neutral pH at lower protecting concentration with formation stable and more active conjugates than colloidal gold conjugates prepared by adsorption of native streptavidin at optimal pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An important advantage of a method with dual labeled antigen is reduction of the nonspecific reactions and some cross-reactive reactions, which can contribute to false-positive results in conventional tests. The application of new peptides conjugates for analysis of a big population of normal sera samples have shown that OD values in new test are significantly lower than for the same population tested in conventional ELISA tests. For most sera tested as undiluted samples OD values were equal to the blank reagent. Low cutoff values can be calculated for new tests using various approaches, demonstrating that dual labeled antigen method better discriminate positive and negative results (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The formation of triple complex of anti-peptide antibody with two different peptide conjugates depends on several factors including antibody affinity, antibody class, concentration and the amount of peptide in the conjugates as well as the molar ratio of peptides and antibodies in the sample. To initiate specific complex formation in solution the two conjugates sample should be mixed to obtain a solution containing both conjugates. Several reaction products will be formed including: first, a complex of antibodies with peptide-detector label (complex 1), second, a complex of antibody with peptide conjugates of the second component of the bioaffinity pair (complex 2), and, finally, a triple complex of antibody with the two different peptide conjugates (complex 3). Complex 1 contains label, but can not be captured on solid phase, while complex 2 can be captured but does not contains label and can not detected after washing. Only triple complex 3 can be captured and detected. Antibody with only two antigen-combining sites (IgG, IgE) can be captured and detected only in complex with equal amount of both conjugates. Complexes of antibodies having four or more antigen-combining sites can be captured and detected at any ratio of conjugates in complex allowed by antibody structure at the condition that at least one of each should be present in the complex. For, example, antibodies of the IgM class containing up to 10 antigen-combining sites conditions which allow for complex formation with one molecule of peptide conjugate needed for capture and several of the peptide conjugates with label will provide for higher sensitivity of antibody detection because more label will present per each antibody in captured complex (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This is only simple schematic picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Other combinations of dually-labeled antigens with antibodies are also possible-especially for conjugates containing more than one antigen molecule, when more than one antibody can be involved in complex with one polyepitopic (multiantigenic) conjugate. According to this scheme the likelihood (statistical probability) of formation of a triple immune complex is higher when total antigen concentration (amount) exceed the amount of specific antibodies&mdash;i.e. the method of the invention is particularly well suited for antibody detection in low titer samples. When antibody concentration in the antibody sample increases at a constant concentration of antigen in the conjugates, the relative ratio of complex of one type of conjugate/triple immune complex (portion of complexes with only one conjugates) increases&mdash;which can lead at appropriate ratios to formation of small amounts of triple complex and as a result to a decrease in the signal for samples with high concentration of antibodies (high dose hook effect). Using affinity purified anti-peptide antibodies spiked into normal human serum, it was found that high dose hook effect can be observed for high affinity antibodies at concentrations which significantly exceed concentration in the linear range for OD/concentration (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). This effect can not lead to false negative results, because it is observed at concentrations rarely present in patient samples and signals do not drops to very low levels. The sensitivity of antibody detection depends on the ratio between capture capacity of the solid phase in respect to the bioaffinity partner and the concentration of conjugate of antigen with the affinity counterpart. If the binding capacity of the solid phase with immobilized affinity partner is significantly less than the amount of conjugated counterpart in the sample, then reduction of sensitivity may arise as result of competition between conjugates not involved in immune complex formation and involved in triple or dual immune complex. Decreasing the conjugate concentration can minimize this effect, but at the same time sensitivity may drop as a result of the lowering of concentration of reagents with a concomitant reduction of antibody concentration range which can tolerate the high dose hook effect. Accordingly, by these considerations, a solid phase which can except large amounts of capture reagent, exceeding the amount of reagents in solution and not a limiting factor for selection of conjugate concentration, can provide for the highest levels of sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Various membrane formats including dot-blot, flow-through and lateral flow formats which use membranes with high binding capacity are potentially good formats for application of the method of the current invention. Several membrane formats were developed for antibody detection using Bi-PEG-BSA as a capture reagent and peptide-StrAv, peptide-HRP and peptide-colloidal gold conjugates to demonstrate the advantages of dual labeled antigen method (see Examples 10, 11, 15,16,17, 18). Both membrane tests using HRP as a detector label, dot-blot (Example 17) and flow-through (Example 15) have shown analytical sensitivity exceeding the sensitivity of conventional IgG/IgM ELISA (Example 13) according to a comparison of detection limits for serially diluted positive sera. Membrane versions with colloidal gold conjugates (see Examples 16 and 17) also work well and clearly discriminate negative and positive sera. Colloidal gold conjugates of C6 peptide with C6-StrAv were also applied in lateral flow format as dry reagents in conjugate pad and Bi-PEG-BSA striped on membrane as capture line. Clear discrimination between negative and positive sera have been found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The method of the current invention accepts that formation of the immune complex with dual-labeled antigens and its capture can proceed as a single step when samples containing antibody are mixed directly with conjugates in coated solid phase. This then requires a single washing step after incubation. The process of specific complex formation and its capture can also be carried out in two steps. In this case, the sample is first incubated with conjugates and subsequently transferred into solid phase with capture reagent (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Simultaneous incubation of the sample with peptide conjugates and a single washing step was especially advantageous in various tests using plates, tubes, and balls as a solid phase. Significant simplification and shortening of assay procedures for antibody detection can be achieved. As a further optimization of assay procedure, agitation may be used for acceleration of a capture process that further shortens the assay time and improves linearity of the dependence of signal/antibody concentrations. In membrane based tests, preincubation of sample with conjugates can be the procedure of choice. In rapid lateral flow tests, conjugates can be used as one reagent dried on one conjugate pad material or two antigen conjugates can be distributed among two separate conjugate pads. The formation of a specific immune complex in this last cases will precede by binding on capture line or membrane area with the applied capture reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> One of the embodiments of the current invention utilizes peptide (antigen) conjugates containing more than one peptide or polypeptide (antigen type) in the conjugate with detector label and bioaffinity partner. Conjugates containing various antigens can be also mixed and used as single reagent for detection of several antibodies in a single sample (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). When necessary, multiple antibody classes involved in specific immune complex can be analyzed by adding a step of incubation with class-specific antibody into solid phase containing captured immune complex with dual labeled antigens as described in Example 20. Repeating this with detection antibodies specific to all the various antibody classes provides a detailed picture of the immune status of antibody production in a patient antibody sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Reagents and assay principles developed in current invention can also be applied for the detection of components of infectious agents bearing epitopes used for antibody detection i.e. for antigen detection. In this case (Example 19), sample, containing the antigen is first incubated with a small amount of epitope-specific antibody (this may be affinity purified using anti-peptide antibody or whole sera containing peptide-specific antibody), then the mixture is contacted with the solid phase containing the capture reagent and peptide conjugate components described above. The epitope-bearing substance in the sample competes with the peptide conjugates for antibody binding and reduces the signal in concentration dependent manner. Standard curves may be generated using known quantities of the epitope bearing substance (i.e. peptide or polypeptide or protein bearing the antigen). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows examples of detection of whole recombinant VLSe protein using this approach&mdash;which demonstrates that ng amount of antigenic substance can be readily detected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Solutions of Maleimide-BSA (50-100 mg/ml), Maleimide-StrAv (5-7 mg/ml) and Maleimide-HRP (11-15 mg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, were mixed at appropriate molar ratio (in range of 0.5:1 to 8:1) with freshly prepared peptide solution in water (10 mg/ml). Molar ratio peptide/protein was calculated on the basis of peptide concentration adjusted for the content of reactive thiol groups determined in DTNB test (40-80% of total peptide). For C6 peptide (MW 2,780) 1:1 molar ratio was equivalent to 46.3 ug/mg BSA or StrAv (MW 60,000 for either protein) and 69.5 ug /mg HRP (MW 40,000). For C10 peptide (MW 1,241) 1:1 molar ratio was at 20.6 ug /mg BSA or StrAv and 31 ug/mg HRP. Mixtures were incubated for 30-60 min at room temperature. Almost 100% of thiol-peptides reacted with maleimide, as judged by DTNB test of reaction mixtures. Then, solution of beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mg/ml in water, was added at 3-5-fold molar excess over residual maleimide groups. Conjugates were purified by dialysis against 0.1M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 using dialysis membrane with cut-off 12,000-14,000 Da (to remove the fraction of unconjugated peptides that do not have reactive thiols). After dialysis, protein concentration was determined using A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>or A<highlight><subscript>403 </subscript></highlight>coefficients shown in the example. Peptide concentration in conjugate solutions was calculated assuming that all added peptide with reactive SH groups has reacted with maleimide-activated proteins (as confirmed by DTNB test), using the values of weigh ratios shown above. </paragraph>
