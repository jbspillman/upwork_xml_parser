<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a sensor with a carrier board which is arranged in a housing produced at least partly in an injection molding process and which is fitted with electronic, optical, electromechanical and/or opto-electronic components, wherein a region of the carrier board and at least some of the components disposed thereon are arranged in a hollow space formed inside the at least partly injection molded housing. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a sensor comprising a carrier board which is arranged in a housing manufactured at least partly in an injection molding process and is fitted with electronic, optical, electro-mechanical and/or opto-electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Sensors of the said kind are used, for example as magnetic sensors, inductive sensors or opto-electronic sensors, in the most varied manner. In this connection, it is in particular desirable to also be able to use the sensors under extreme conditions, for example with high or very varying temperatures or at moving parts at which the sensors are exposed to high accelerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The fact is disadvantageous with the known sensors that the said temperature strains or acceleration strains frequently result in damage to sensor components or to the whole sensor, which can ultimately result in a malfunction or a standstill of machinery and plant in which the sensor is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention consists of further developing a sensor of the kind initially named such that its resistance capability to temperature changes and in particular also to acceleration forces, and thus also its service life, is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This object is satisfied in accordance with the invention in that a region of the carrier board and at least some of the components disposed thereon are arranged in a hollow space formed within the housing which is at least partly injection molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The possibility exists due to the arrangement in accordance with the invention of a region of the carrier board inside a hollow space that temperature-induced size changes in the said region of the carrier board, in particular an expansion of the said region, cannot result in damage to the carrier board, since there is sufficient room present in the hollow space in accordance with the invention for such expansions. Accordingly, these temperature-induced size changes can also not result in damage to the components arranged on the said region of the carrier board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, said region of the carrier board has so much room available in the hollow space that it can execute vibrations triggered by accelerations of the sensor. For this purpose, the carrier board must have a certain elasticity, with the elasticity of commercial boards being sufficient. Due to the possibility of the execution of vibrations, accelerations of the sensor are not directly transmitted to the components arranged on the said region of the carrier board; it is rather achieved that these accelerations are &ldquo;cushioned&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a sensor in accordance with the invention has an increased resistance to temperature changes, in particular to a large lowering of the temperature and to accelerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is preferred for the components arranged in the hollow space to be arranged spaced from the boundary of the hollow space. It is ensured in this manner that acceleration forces cannot be transmitted directly from the boundary of the hollow space to the components; a vibration of the carrier board is rather made possible which cushions the accelerations and only transmits them to the components in a reduced manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is of advantage if the lower side and the upper side of the region of the carrier board arranged in the hollow space are arranged spaced from the boundary of the hollow space. It is achieved in this manner that the carrier board can execute vibrations both downwardly and upwardly. An acceleration acting on the sensor can thus set the carrier board into a harmonious, slowly decaying vibration which results in an optimized reduction in the acceleration forces acting on the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous for the end faces of the region of the carrier board arranged in the hollow space to be arranged spaced from the boundary of the hollow space. In this manner, said region can expand in all directions due to temperature increases and/or it becomes possible for the housing to contract without the carrier board and the boundary of the hollow space abutting one another. A shearing off of components surrounded by injection molded material, which is possible in accordance with the prior art, is likewise avoided since, in accordance with the invention, the components are not surrounded by injection molded material, but are arranged in the hollow space. Temperature-induced forces on the carrier board and/or on the components, and damage linked thereto, are therefore generally avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The carrier board can be fixed, for example, only to one side of the hollow space in the material surrounding the hollow space so that the carrier board projects into the hollow space like a spring board. An optimum expansion and vibration possibility of the carrier board is thus achieved. In this connection, it is particularly preferred for the region of the carrier board arranged outside the hollow space to be at least regionally surrounded by injection molded housing material to fix the carrier board in the hollow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> At least one movement limiting element can project into the hollow space with its end region facing the carrier board being arranged spaced from the carrier board. Such a movement limiting element can serve to limit the bendings of the carrier board brought about by vibrations thereof such that the bendings of the carrier board always move in its elasticity region and thus a breaking off of the carrier board is prevented. In this connection, the spacing between the end region of the movement limiting element and the carrier board must be optimized such that vibrations with an amplitude which is large as possible are allowed, on the one hand, in order to thus achieve a maximum cushioning of accelerations acting on the components, and such that said oscillations are limited, on the other hand, such that their amplitude cannot become so large that a breaking off of the carrier board occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The movement limiting element is sensibly arranged at that side of the hollow space remote from the region in which the carrier board is fixed in the material surrounding the hollow space. It is thus ensured that the movement limiting element is disposed where the largest vibration amplitudes of the carrier board occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is of advantage if two movement limiting elements are provided of which one is directed toward the upper side and the other toward the lower side of the carrier board. The vibration amplitudes of the carrier board can thus be directly limited in both directions. The movement limiting element(s) can be formed, for example, by the housing material and be jointly produced with the housing-forming injection molding procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additional components disposed outside the hollow space and surrounded by injection molded housing material can be arranged on the carrier board. In particular such components are suitable for this which are less sensitive to accelerations so that here the protection against accelerations which is required by the measures in accordance with the invention can be dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hollow space in accordance with the invention can be formed by a sleeve, in particular a beaker-shaped sleeve, which completely receives the carrier board and in which housing material is only injected regionally so that the region of the carrier board arranged in the hollow space is disposed outside the housing material and the region of the carrier board arranged outside the hollow space is surrounded by injection molded housing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the hollow space in accordance with the invention can also be formed by means of an internal gas pressure method known from the prior art. In this case, the sleeve described above can be dispensed with. Moreover, in this case, the whole housing can be produced in the course of a single injection molding process. A complex casting required in other manufacturing processes is thus omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent claims.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> substantially rectangular in cross-section with rounded edges, with a hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being formed in the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, said hollow space being completely surrounded by housing material, having a likewise substantially rectangular shape in cross-section and extending, seen in the longitudinal direction of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, over a region thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is arranged in the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with a region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being disposed inside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the remaining region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being disposed outside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this connection, the region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed outside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is surrounded by housing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Shock-sensitive electronic and electro-mechanical components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are arranged on the region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed in the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, like the lower side <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the end face <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, have a spacing to the boundary <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the hollow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thus fixed in place at its region disposed outside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the housing material of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and accordingly projects like a spring board into the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At the side of the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> remote from the fixing of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, two movement limiting elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are provided which project into the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are directed toward the upper side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or the lower side <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this connection, the movement limiting elements terminate at a low spacing from the upper side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or from the lower side <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, additional, shock-insensitive components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are arranged on the upper side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and are located, however, outside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are surrounded by housing material of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is embedded in the housing material of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are guided from this inside the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made, for example, as a circuit board. A power supply or an exchange of data can take place via the wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The following is achieved by the arranged in accordance with the invention of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Since the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is only surrounded by housing material and is thus fixed in place at its region disposed to the right of the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and as the remaining region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> projects like a spring board into the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is ensured that the region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed in the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can expand or contract as a result of temperature changes, without the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> arranged thereon, abutting the boundary <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the hollow space. Damage to the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by temperature effects are thus effectively avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is furthermore ensured that the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can vibrate about an axis substantially disposed at the position <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and extending perpendicular to the plane of the drawing when accelerations of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> occur, with the amplitude of this vibration being limited by the two movement limiting elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Only damped or cushioned acceleration forces are transmitted to the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to this vibration possibility so that shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be used in a sensor in accordance with the invention. It is ensured by the limitating of the vibration amplitude by the movement limiting elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> cannot release from the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> due to the vibrations and the deflections associated therewith and that the solder points of the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are not damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> explained in the following show two different possibilities for manufacturing a sensor in accordance with the invention, with all advantages which were explained above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> being able to be realized with both variants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show a cross-section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and a longitudinal section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) through a sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can be used in accordance with the invention and which has a cylindrical shape at its outer side and is closed at an end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> such that the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ultimately represents a beaker-shaped formation. Two diametrically opposed elongate grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are worked in at the inner side of the sleeve and extend from the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> up to and into a region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> spaced from the oppositely disposed end face <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a representation in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with a carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being inserted so far into the elongate grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that its end confronting the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comes to lie at a spacing from this end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are arranged at the upper side <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and at the lower side <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with the components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> all being disposed at a greater spacing from the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> than the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are shock-sensitive components, whereas the components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shock-insensitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If optical components are also used, it is sensible to provide the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a window through which radiation can pass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which merge into a cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The end of the cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> facing the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> ends inside the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is dimensioned such that it can still be moved upwardly and downwardly inside the elongate grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over a low path distance. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> position of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is shown in which it is disposed centrally in the elongate grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that it could theoretically be movable both upwardly and downwardly. The injection method described in the following in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> takes place while the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fixed in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by means of a suitable holding tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is injected into the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the end face <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, with the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fixed in the said manner. The housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably consist of the same material since then a good connection and/or sealing results between the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The injection molding process is continued for so long until the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> surrounds the cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and all components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The injection molding process is ended directly thereafter so that the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> does not reach up to the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is achieved in this manner that the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> projects from the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> like a spring board in the direction of the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ultimately come to lie in a hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed inside the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is upwardly and downwardly movable in the elongate groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in this hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that it can execute the vibrations explained above. The amplitude of these vibrations is, however, limited by the elongate groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To this extent, the function of the elongate grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> corresponds in the completed state of the sensor to the function of the movement limiting elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> What is important is that the dimensions of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are dimensioned perpendicular to the plane of the drawing such that the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> would be movable&mdash;where it is not fixed in place by the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&mdash;perpendicular to the plane of the drawing in all directions, i.e. in the direction of the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and in the directions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) perpendicular thereto, since it does not abut the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in these directions. This has the effect that the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can expand perpendicular to the plane of the drawing or that the sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can contract in the event of temperature increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and shock-insensitive components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged thereon. Two wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected to the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and open into a cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The arrangement of the said parts <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corresponds to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is now introduced into an injection mold&mdash;not shown&mdash;whose inner dimensions correspond at least substantially to the outer contour of the sensor housing ultimately to be achieved. Injection of housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into the injection mold is subsequently started, with this injection procedure taking place at the same side of the sensor as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the method step of the injection molding process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the shock-insensitive components <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the corresponding region of the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the wires <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the cable insulation <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are surrounded by housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It can furthermore be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> that a gas injection nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arranged in the region of the shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and allows the carrying out of an internal gas pressure injection molding known from the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the course of the further injection procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the housing material penetrates up to and into a region of the shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, with simultaneously gas being brought into the region of the shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the gas injection nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The introduction of this gas through the gas injection nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has the effect that a hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts forming in the region of the shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By continuing the described method, the injection mold&mdash;not shown&mdash;is ultimately completely filled with housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), with simultaneously the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being enlarged by the continued introduction of gas such that all components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are disposed inside the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with a spacing always being present between the boundary <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the hollow space and the components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that no direct contact is produced between the carrier board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the housing material <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> again). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Just before the end of the injection procedure, the gas injection nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is retracted from the region of the sensor housing to be formed such that the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the nozzle aperture can be completely closed by the termination of the injection procedure. Alternatively, the nozzle aperture can also be subsequently closed by means of a plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows, it is also achieved by the latter method that the carrier board projects like a spring board into the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the shock-sensitive components <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is spaced apart from the boundary <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the hollow space. The dimension of the hollow space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> tapering toward the end face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the sensor has the same function in this case as the movement limiting elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
