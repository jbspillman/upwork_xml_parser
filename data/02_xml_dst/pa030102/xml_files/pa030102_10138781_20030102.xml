<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ruptured blood vessels in the brain cause an acute condition known as hemorrhagic stroke. Ruptures or strokes can occur with a number of vascular abnormalities including arterio venous malformation (AVM), fistula, aneurysm (a ballooning of the arterial wall), or a burst blood vessel. In addition, abnormal vasculature is generated in the process of tumor growth and tumors including brain tumors are highly vascularized entities requiring larger than normal blood flow to sustain the tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Endovascular therapy for vaso-occlusion has included injectable agents, balloon-type occlusive devices, and mechanical vaso-occlusive devices such as metal coils. A description of these agents and devices is included in the background section of U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,069. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently, coils for aneurysms and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles for AVMs are FDA approved preventative therapies. Cyanoacrylate glue for AVMs is also proposed and pending approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Over 400,000 persons worldwide, and 125,000 persons in the U.S. annually experience some form of hemorrhagic stroke or blood vessel rupture in the brain. Currently, a need exists in the medical community and the field of interventional neurology to expand and develop devices and/or agents for use in interventional neurology treatments for strokes and tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A need also exists for a vaso-occlusive device that can be deployed at a site of abnormal blood flow and have an ability to create a natural biological response for either organized thrombi formation or endotheliazation to ensure total occlusion of the bleeding region. </paragraph>

The portions of the core <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> that are not covered by the strands of material <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> can be covered by the coating composition <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, covered with a bioactive agent or left exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a composition for coating the metallic or non-metallic cores <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The coating composition comprises a polymer and an effective amount of a bioactive agent. An effective amount will be determined in part by the level of activity desired after implantation of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and can be controlled by such factors as, for example the release rate of the bioactive agent, potency of the bioactive agent, and the desired effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In any of the above-discussed embodiments, the metallic cores <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be made of any metal suitable for implantation into a patient, for example, but not limited to, e.g. platinum, stainless steel, nickel-titanium alloy, tungsten, gold, rhenium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, titanium, nickel, and alloys thereof. The non-metallic cores <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be made of a polymer, copolymer or blend of polymers, using, for example, but not limited to, any of the polymers listed herein. No matter the embodiment, the cores <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are coated with the mixture of the coating polymer and the bioactive agent and upon implantation in a patient at a site of abnormal blood flow, abnormal blood flow is occluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The coating polymer can be biodegradable or may be a carrier polymer for the bioactive agent, and remain as a matrix or nondegrading structure around the vaso-occlusive device. If the coating polymer is biodegradable, as the polymer degrades in the body at the site of implantation, the bioactive agent is released at the site and it reacts or acts at the site according to the nature of the bioactive agent. The coating polymer can be any polymer-based molecule that can coat metal, metal alloy, or non-metal material. Suitable definitions for the terms biocompatible and biodegradable are found in Katz, Medical Devices and Diagnostic Industry, January 2001, &ldquo;Developments in Medical Polymers for Biomaterials Applications&rdquo;, pp 122-132. Materials for use in making the vaso-occlusive devices are also describe in Katz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The coating polymer can be, e.g., selected from the group consisting of but not limited to polyacrylamide (PAAM), poly (N-isopropylacrylamine) (PNIPAM), poly (vinylmethylether), poly (ethylene oxide), poly (vinylalcohol), poly (ethyl (hydroxyethyl) cellulose), poly(2-ethyl oxazoline), Polylactide (PLA), Polyglycolide (PGA), Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) PLGA, Poly(e-caprolactone), Polydiaoxanone, Polyanhydride, Trimethylene carbonate, Poly(&bgr;-hydroxybutyrate), Poly(g-ethyl glutamate), Poly(DTH-iminocarbonate), Poly(bisphenol A iminocarbonate), Poly(orthoester) (POE), Polycyanoacrylate (PCA), Polyphosphazene, Polyethyleneoxide (PEO), Polyethylglycol (PEG), Polyacrylacid (PAA), Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), Polyvinylacrylate (PVA), and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyglycolic lactic acid (PGLA), or similar compounds with similar qualities capable of coating metal, biodegrading and release a bioactive agent from the composition. The PGLA disclosed herein is formed by mixing PGA and PLA in ratios of 99.9:00.1 to 50:50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The coating polymer may also be a natural polymer, e.g. polymers such as, but not limited to collagen, silk, fibrin, gelatin, hyaluron, cellulose, chitin, dextran, casein, albumin, ovalbumin, heparin sulfate, starch, agar, heparin, alginate, fibronectin, fibrin and pectin, elastin, keratin, copolymers thereof, and blended polymers thereof, and the like that can coat metal, metal alloy, or non-metal material and retain and release a bioactive agent as the coating polymer itself either degrades in the body or remains on the device as a matrix. In one embodiment, the coating could be a combination of natural and hydrogel copolymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can also comprise a bioactive agent that is reactive at the site of implantation. For example, the bioactive agent may promote maintaining the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at the site of abnormal blood flow, may promote regrowth of a damaged vascular wall, may help to heal the site, may inhibit continued or re-vascularization, may inhibit or regress tumor growth, and such like biological activities at the site of implantation or abnormal blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The bioactive agent can be any bioactive agent possessing a desired bioactivity. Thus, for example and not by way of limitation, bioactive agents can include a growth factor, an inhibiting factor, an endothelization factor, an extracellular matrix-forming factor, a cell adhesion factor, a tissue adhesion factor, an immunological factor, a healing factor, a vascular endothelial growth factor, a scarring factor, a tumor suppressor, an antigen-binding factor, an anti-cancer factor, a monoclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody against a growth factor, a drug, a drug producing cell, a cell regeneration factor, a progenitor cell of the same type as vascular tissue, and an a progenitor cell that is histiologically different from vascular tissue. The bioactive agent can be a tissue adhesion factor, and the tissue adhesion factor can be selected, for example, but not limited to, fibrin, collagen, albumin, cyanoacrylate, fibrinogen, chitosan, and gelatin-genipin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In general, any agent having a desired bioactivity can be used in the coating. An effective amount of a bioactive agent is that amount of agent that will mix with the coating polymer to form the composition of the invention so that upon release of the bioactive agent at the site of implantation, the bioactivity generated promotes the desired change at the site. The effectiveness and thus the quantity of the bioactive agent needed will depend on the nature of the bioactive agent, its potency, the rate of release of the bioactive agent from the composition, and other such variable factors. The effective amount can be determined by standard assays known in the art for each bioactive agent selected. Some standard assays for bioactive agents are provided in books having standard laboratory procedures and assays. Additionally, more than one bioactive agent can be used in the composition, such as for example, a drug and an antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The bioactive agent can be integrated into the coating polymer. The coating polymer can alternatively be coated onto the metal and the bioactive agent is coated onto the polymer coating. Coating can be accomplished, for example, by spraying, dipping, jacketing, weaving, braiding, spinning, ion implantation, plasma deposition, and vapor deposition. These coating processes may be accomplished as is standard in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,012 describes a process usable with the present invention by which proteins and other bioactive agents can be incorporated into a polymer during a forming process such as extrusion, molding or casting, and which principles can also be applied to coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,348 describes production of novel polymers using recombinant techniques, and also integration of bioactive agents potentially useful at a site of implantation in the patient, providing an alternate means of coating or integrating the bioactive agent into the coating polymer. This production can be used with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The cores <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the coated metal or non-metal vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can assume a pre-implantation shape and an implanted or vaso-occluding shape. As a result, each coil <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> will also assume a pre-implantation and a vaso-occluding shape. When in its pre-implantation shape, the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is coated with the composition comprising a polymer and a bioactive agent. The pre-implantation shaped device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is then implanted at the site of abnormal blood flow. During or after the introduction of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> into the body, the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> assumes its vaso-occluding shape at a desired site, such as a site of abnormal blood flow. As shown in the figures, this vaso-occluding shape is different from the pre-implantation shape. For example, in its vaso-occluding shape, the portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can become entangled with each other (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Pre-implantation shapes and vaso-occluding shapes can be any combination of shapes that are implantable (the pre-implantation shape) and that help to promote vaso-occlusion after implantation (the vaso-occluding shape). Thus for example, the pre-implantation shape can be (but is not limited to) a strip, rod, sheet, roll, tube, ribbon, string, and a coil. The vaso-occluding shape can comprise a shape including (but not limited to) for example a coil, a coiled coil, a circle, a half circle, a cone, a twisted sheet, a rod of random bends, and a helix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Examples of permissible shapes for pre-implantation or vaso-occluding shapes of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> include but are not limited to those shapes described in DES 407,818(spherical); knotted and tangling coil as described in Ritchart U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The change in-between the pre-implantation and vaso-occluding shapes in a given device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be slight, and may result merely upon implantation and release from a container or implantation or delivery tool, and thus the vaso-occluding shape resulting from a given deliverable pre-implantation shape may be random and somewhat unpredictable. Alternatively, the change in shape can be due to the material alloy used for the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment in which the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is formed of a shape-memory alloy such as Nitinol, the shape of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can change in response to the body temperature experienced after implantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can also comprise a radio pacifier. The radio pacifier can comprise an agent that provides visibility of the device under X-ray or other imaging technology such as CT scans, MRIs and flouroscopy. The radio pacifier permits the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to be monitored and detected once inside the patient. The radio pacifier can comprise, for example, a contrast media or a metal powder, but is not limited to these items. The metal powder can be, for example, titanium, tungsten, gold, bismuth, barium sulfate or tantalum powder. Additionally, the radio pacifier includes a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent. These agents can include, but are not limited to, Gadopentetate, Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd DTPA or Magnevist (R)), Gadoteridol (Gd HP-DO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A or ProHance (R)), Gadodiamide (Gd DTPA-BMA or Omniscan (R)), Gadoversetamide (Gd DTPA-BMEA or OptiMARK (R)), Gd-DOTA (Magnevist (R) or Dotarem (R)), Gd-DTPA labeled albumin, and Gd-DTPA labeled dextran. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the coils <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> are delivered to the surgeon, other practitioner or attendant in pre-cut or pre-formed lengths. In this embodiment, each coil is cut to a predetermined length. For example, the length of the coils <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as it is delivered can be in the range from about 1 mm to about 5 meters. In a preferred embodiment, the lengths of the coils <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for delivery to the patient can be in a range from about 1 mm to about 10 mm. In an embodiment, the dimensions of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be from about 0.125 mm to about 12.50 mm, or the outside diameter of objects suitable for passing through a delivery device to a site of abnormal bleeding. The diameter of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> once it is delivered and after it has assumed its vaso-occluding shape (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) can be in a range from about 1 mm to about 50 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Dimensions for the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for delivery to the patient can be in a range from about 0.005 inches to about 0.50 inches, or the outside diameter of objects suitable for passing through a delivery device to a site of abnormal bleeding. The lengths of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as it is delivered can comprise in the range from about 1 mm to about 5 meters. The diameter of the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> once it is delivered and after it has assumed its vaso-occluding shape can be in a range from about 1 mm to about 50 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a method of making the coated vaso-occlusive devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> described above. The method comprises coating a metal, metal alloy, or non-metal material having a pre-implantation shape (such as those shapes described herein) with at least one of the compositions described above, or a coating that includes either one of the above-discussed polymers or bioactive agents, such that the coating still allows the pre-implantation shape to form the vaso-occlusive shape during or after implantation in the patient. The change from the pre-implantation shape to the vaso-occluding shape can be slight. As discussed above, this change is shape can result from a mere release of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in an implantation delivery device to the site where the vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> conforms to the space differential (between the delivery device and the site of abnormal blood flow) or in response to the body heat experienced by a shape memory alloy from which the device is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Coating can be accomplished by any method or process that effectively provides a layer of the composition on at least part of the metal coil core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vaso-occluding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Thus, for example, but not by way of limitation, the composition can be contacted with the metal or alloy core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> by spraying, dipping, jacketing, weaving, braiding, spinning, ion implantation, plasma deposition, and vapor deposition. Weaving, braiding and spinning would entail taking threads of the material and winding, weaving, braiding or sewing them in and around the metal, metal alloy, or non-metal material of the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The presumption here is that the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> will be effectively coated by such efforts to surround the metal or non-metal material with strands of the composition. Coating can be accomplished generally as described in Odowaki et al, 2000 Society for Biomaterials &ldquo;Development of Argatoban Coated Metallic Stent for Prevention of Post-Operative Restenosis&rdquo;, pp. 1023, 6<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>World Biomaterials Congress transactions. Spinning is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,348. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Coating can be accomplished in a process of implanting or delivering the device into the patient, e.g. the metallic or non-metallic core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is loaded in a solution of a polymer and a bioactive agent, and upon release in the patient, the coating solution coats the core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and the coated device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is released into the patient, as a coated article (thereafter assuming a vaso-occlusive shape). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method of treating a patient having abnormal blood flow at a site in the body. The method comprises implanting into the patient the coated vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the invention as described herein. The core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is coated with at least one of the compositions discussed above comprising a polymer and bioactive agent. Once coated, the pre-implantation shaped device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is implanted into the patient and the device assumes its vaso-occluding vaso-occluding shape as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The vaso-occlusive device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is especially useful for treating vessel ruptures, aneurysms, AVMs, fistulas, benign or malignant tumors and other conditions manifesting abnormal blood flow. </paragraph>
