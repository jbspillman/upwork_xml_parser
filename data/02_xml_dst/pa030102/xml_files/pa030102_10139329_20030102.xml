<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device. More specifically, it relates to an improved method for forming an ultra shallow junction in a PMOS device by positioning a screen oxide film to which an inert gas is ion-implanted between a gate electrode and a nitride film spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In current methods for making PMOS devices, nitride film spacers are used to obtain a channel length and protect an electrode. Stress differences between polysilicon and the nitride material cause problems, however. In order to solve this problem, an oxide film is formed between the nitride film spacer and the polysilicon. However, it is difficult to selectively deposit the oxide film on a predetermined portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The nitride film spacer is formed by depositing a nitride film on the oxide film, and performing a full etching process thereon. Thereafter, an impurity junction region is formed according to an ion implant process using the appropriate dopants. Here, defects of p-type dopants are generated due to low solubility in semiconductor substrates that are composed of silicon, and due to transient enhanced diffusion (TED) of the p-type dopants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After the ion implant process for forming p&plus; source/drain regions, unwanted diffusion in the channel length direction and punch-through in the depth direction may occur. Diffusion by the p-type dopants reduces the effective channel length. Oxidative enhanced diffusion (OED) of the oxide film between the gate electrode and the nitride film spacer in the depth direction causes the punch-through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Conventional PMOS devices employ a buried channel, which is a channel formed by a depletion mode in the channel region using n&plus; poly silicon layers. However, threshold voltage adjusting dopants and junction forming dopants can diffuse in the depth direction due to the TED phenomenon during a succeeding annealing process. This can also deterioratethe quality of the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, p&plus; source/drain regions in PMOS transistors have been formed using BF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ions. However, F<highlight><subscript>19 </subscript></highlight>ions in BF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ions also reduce quality of the gate insulating film. Specifically, F<highlight><subscript>19 </subscript></highlight>ions are impurities that can cause defects in the transistor. For instance, F<highlight><subscript>19 </subscript></highlight>ions can form a thin film between the oxide films deposited between the gate electrode and the nitride film spacer. This can reduce a stress resulting from the gate insulating film and the nitride film spacer for protecting the gate electrode. In addition, such growth defects can generate leakage current during the succeeding annealing process. Because the ion implant process for forming the p&plus; source/drain regions using BF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>exposes the transistor to F<highlight><subscript>19 </subscript></highlight>impurities, such problems from F<highlight><subscript>19 </subscript></highlight>impurities are unavoidable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An element isolating insulating film (not shown) defining an active region is formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The element isolating insulating film is formed according to a shallow trench isolation (STI) process, thereby maximizing a margin of the active region by miniaturization of the device, and stabilizing a well property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a gate insulating film (not shown) is formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Here, the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is cleaned by HF and SC-1 solution before forming the gate insulating film. The gate insulating film is formed at a thickness of 40 to 100 &square; according to a wet oxidation process using hydrogen and oxygen at a temperature of 750 to 800&deg; C., and an annealing process in a nitrogen atmosphere of 800 to 950&deg; C. for 20 to 30 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A stacked structure of a p-type polysilicon layer, WNx layer and W layer is formed on the gate insulating film. Here, the p-type polysilicon layer is formed at a thickness of 700 to 1000 &square; according to a low pressure chemical mechanical polishing (LPCVD) process using a silicon source gas such as SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and POCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas at a temperature of 510 to 550&deg; C. under a pressure of 0.1 to 3.0 Torr. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a screen oxide film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed over the resultant structure.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Nitrogen ions are implanted into the whole surface of the screen oxide film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Here, the ion implant process is performed by using dopant of 1E14 to 3E15 ion/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at a tilt of 30 to 60&deg; with an ion implant energy of 0.5 to 5 keV, so that the dopant is not implanted to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The ion implant process is performed by plasma doping (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A nitride film for a spacer (not shown) is formed over the resultant structure, an annealing process is performed at the same time to nitrify the screen oxide film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Here, the nitride film for the spacer is deposited according to a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process using NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and DCS(SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl <highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A nitrified screen oxide film pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed at the side walls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the gate insulating film pattern <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the active region of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by removing the nitride film for the spacer and the nitrified screen oxide film according to a full etching process, and a nitride film spacer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed on the nitrified screen oxide film pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the side walls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the same time. Here, the screen oxide film pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a small amount of ion-implanted nitrogen protects p&plus; source/drain regions formed in a succeeding process, and restricts out-diffusion of F<highlight><subscript>19</subscript></highlight>, thereby reducing defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> P&plus; impurities are ion-implanted to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at both sides of the nitride film spacer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The P&plus; source/drain regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed according to a rapid thermal process. The rapid thermal process is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere of 800 to 950&deg; C. raised at a speed of 50 to 150&deg; C. Here, the rapid thermal process is executed in the nitrogen atmosphere to restrict the TED of B<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>in the channel side. </paragraph>

When the nitride film is used as the screen insulating film, the diffusion by the TED, especially by the OED, is restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As discussed earlier, in accordance with the present invention, the stabilized junction is formed by simultaneously adjusting diffusion in the channel direction and depth direction by restricting the TED and the OED, and reducing a short channel effect and diffusion in the depth direction, by positioning the nitrified oxide film between the gate electrode and the nitride film spacer formed at the side walls of the gate electrode in order to remove defects generated due to stress difference between the gate electrode and the nitride film spacer in the formation process of the PMOS transistor. It is thus possible to embody the device which has the ultra shallow junction and which is not influenced by miniaturization. </paragraph>
