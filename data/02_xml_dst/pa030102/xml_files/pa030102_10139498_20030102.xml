<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the topical treatment and prevention of inflammatory disorders and related conditions using extracts of feverfew (<highlight><italic>Tanacetum parthenium</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Tanacetum parthenium, </italic></highlight>a plant commonly known as Feverfew, has been recognized since the Middle Ages as having significant medicinal properties when taken orally&mdash;used as a general febrifuge, hence its common name. Many have isolated extracts of the plant and those extracts have been used to orally treat migraines, arthritis, and bronchial complaints. (See Johnson et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,433, discussing the treatment of a variety of diseases by oral, inhalation, injection or suppository administration of the extract and see WO 94 06800, discussing a extract of feverfew which contains parthenolide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Extracts of feverfew contain many components. Although not all components have been isolated and characterized, the known components of an extract of feverfew contain a significant number of biologically active components. To date, the chemical constituents of whole feverfew extract are as follows: apigenin-7-glucoside, apigenin-7-glucuronide, 1-&bgr;-hydroxyarbusculin, 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,7-4&prime;-trimethylether (Tanetin), 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,7-dimethyl ether, 8-&bgr;-reynosin, 10-epicanin, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, calcium, chromium, chrysanthemolide, chrysanthemomin, chrysarten-A, chrsyarten-c, chrysoeriol-7-glucuronide, cobalt, cosmosiin, epoxyartemorin, luteolin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucuronide, mangnoliolide, parthenolide, quercetagentin-3,7,3&prime;-trimethylether, quercetagetin-3&prime;7-dimethylether, reynosin, tanaparthin, tanaparthin-1&agr;,4&agr;-epoxide, tanaparthin-1&bgr;,4&bgr;-epoxide, &bgr;-costunolide, 3-&bgr;-hydroxy-parthenolide, and 3,7,3&prime;-trimethoxyquercetagetin. The specific role that each of these component compounds plays in the biological activity of feverfew is to date unknown. However, some information is known about the allergic reactions to the extract. It is believed that many of these allergic reactions are caused by the &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactones such as parthenolide. (See, Arch. Dermatol. Forsch. 1975, 251 (3):235-44; Arch. Dermatol. Forsch 1976, 255 (2):111-21; Contact Dermatitis, 1988, 38 (4):207-8; Am. J. Contact Dermatol. 1998-9 (1):49-50; Br. J. Dermatol, 1995, 132 (4): 543-47). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Despite the existence of oral methods of using extracts of feverfew, there are no defined methods for topically using these extracts to treat or prevent inflammatory disorders and related conditions. In addition, there are no teachings which describe the use of an extract of feverfew which does not contain the allergy causing &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactones. These are two areas which are addressed by this invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The terms, inflammatory disorder and related condition, feverfew, effective amount, and patient, have their aforementioned meanings. The term &ldquo;skin&rdquo; includes all surfaces of a patient, such as the exposed hide or surfaces covered by hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a method of treating and preventing inflammatory disorders and related conditions which comprises applying a topical composition comprising an effective amount of an extract of feverfew to a patient where said extract is &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone-deprived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The terms, inflammatory disorders and related conditions, feverfew, effective amount, and patient have their aforementioned meanings. The term &ldquo;substantially free of &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone&rdquo;, refers to an extract of feverfew having a weight content of the &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactones found in natural feverfew extracts of less than about 0.2% by weight. These &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactones include but are not limited to parthenolide (&lsqb;1&agr;R -(1a R*, 4E,7a S*, 10a S*, 10b R*)&rsqb;2,3,4,7,7a,8,10a,10b-octahydro-1a,5-dimethyl-8-4,5&agr;-epoxy-6&bgr;-hydroxy-germacra-1(10), 11(13)-dien-12-oic acid &ggr;-lactone), 3-&bgr;-hydroxy-parthenolide, costunolide, 3-&bgr;-constunolide,artemorin, 8-&agr;-hydroxy-estafiatin, chysanthemolide, magnoliolide, tanaparthin, tanaparthin-1&agr;,4&agr;-epoxide, tanaparthin-1&bgr;,4&bgr;-epoxide, chrysanthemonin, and other sesquiterpenes. Preferably, the feverfew extract has a weight content of &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone below about 0.2. Preferably the &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone is parthenolide. The method of preparing this parthenolide-deprived extract is described in an Italian patent application (MI99A001244, filed on Jun. 3, 1999) which is hereby incorporated by reference. Since the &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactones cause some of the allergic reactions to extracts of feverfew, topical compositions made from &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone-deprived extracts are expected to be non-irritating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This invention also includes a method of treating inflammatory disorders and related conditions of the skin by applying a topical composition comprising an effective amount of an extract of feverfew to a patient where said extract is substantially free of &agr;-unsaturated &ggr;-lactone. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Feverfew Which is Substantially Free of Parthenolide </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Two kilograms of Tanacetum parthenium are extracted at 50-60&deg; C. with 20L of 70% aqueous methanol. The extract is concentrated under vacuum to about 1L and diluted with an equal volume of methanol. The resulting solution is extracted with 3&times;2 liters of n-hexane. The hexane extract is evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield about 30 g of residue (extract H). The water-methanolic solution is then extracted with 2&times;0.5L of methylene chloride. The organic phase are evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield about 70 g of residues (extract DCM). The water-methanolic phase (extract HM) is set aside. The DCM extract is dissolved in 0.6L of 90% methanol and treated under stirring with 0.6L of strong basic resin (Relite 2A) for three-four hours. The suspension is filtered under vacuum and the resin is washed with about 2L of 90% methanol. The methanolic solution, containing parthenolide and its congeners, is removed. The basic resin is then treated under stirring for one hour with 0.6L of methanol containing 65 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resin is filtered under vacuum and washed with a further 2.5L of methanol. The filtrate and the washings are combined, concentrated under vacuum to about 200 mL and extracted with 3&times;200 mL of ethyl acetate. The resulting extract (E.A.), containing the flavone components tanetin and congeners, is evaporated to dryness under vacuum, to obtain about 4 g of residue. The residues of the extracts H and E.A. are combined with the extract HM. The resulting solution is evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the solid residue is dried under vacuum at 50&deg; C. to constant weight. About 490 g of extract of departhenolidized T. parthenium are obtained which shows, by HPLC analysis, (column Zorbax SB C18; eluent H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&plus;0.01% TFA; B:MeCN&plus;0.01% TFA; gradient A:B:90%-10%:10%-90%; flow 1 ml/min), a parthenolide content below 0.07%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The ability of feverfew and of parthenolide deprived feverfew to affect the inflammatory responses was illustrated by its ability to reduce the production of lymphocyte function in the following assay. The feverfew (&ldquo;FFW&rdquo;) used in this experiment was commercially obtained from Indena S.p.A. The parthenolide free feverfew (&ldquo;PFFW&rdquo;) was obtained by using the method of Example 1. </paragraph>

In this assay, the compositions of the invention were evaluated against hydrocortisone, a steroid known to inhibit contact hypersensitivity. Albino male CD-1 mice, 7-9 weeks old, were induce on the shaved abdomen with 50 &mgr;L of 3% oxazolone in acetone/corn oil (Day 0). On Day 5, a 20 &mgr;L volume of 2% oxazolone in acetone was appplied to the dorsal left ear of the mouse. Test compounds were applied to the left ear (20 &mgr;L) 1 hour after oxazolone challenge in a 70% ethanol/30% propylene glycol vehicle. The right ear was not treated. The mice were sacrificed by CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>inhalation 24 hours after the oxazolone challenge, the left and right ears were removed and a 7 mm biopsy was taken from each ear and weighed. The difference in biopsy weights between the right and left ear was calculated. Antiinflammatory effects of compounds are evident as an inhibition of the increase in ear weight.

<heading lvl="1">Inhibition of Arachidonic Acid Induced Ear Edema </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this in vivo model, feverfew&apos;s ability to reduce arachidonic acid induced edema was compared to the known cycloxygenase/lipoxgenase inhibitor tepoxalin. Albino male CD-1 mice, 7-9 weeks old, were used. A 20% (w/v) arachidonic acid (AA) solution was made in acetone. A 20 &mgr;l volume of the AA was applied to the dorsal left ear of the mouse. Test compounds (20 &mgr;l ) were applied immediately to the left ear after AA in a 70% ethanol/30% propylene glycol vehicle. The right ear was not treated. The mice were sacrificed by CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>inhalation 1 hour after AA, the left and right ears were removed and a 7 mm biopsy was removed from each ear and weighed. The difference in biopsy weights between the right and left ear was calculated. Antiinflammatory effects of compounds are evident as an inhibition of the increase in ear weight.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Substantially parthenolide-free feverfew (PFFW) was evaluated for its ability to prevent skin inflammation in a controlled human study involving 10 volunteers. In this study, parthenolide deprived everfew was tested at 0.1 and 1% and compared to its vehicle and hydrocortisone also at 0.1 and 1%. Test product was applied to the ventral side of the forearm twice daily for 2 consecutive days. Erythema was induced by 10 successive stratum corneum strippings. Chromameter measurements were made prior to stripping and at 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 hours post stripping. The Colorimetric Erythema Index (CEI) was calculated for each time point. For the total 2 hour period, and compared to the vehicle, the following reductions in erythema were obtained;
