<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an in-tank fuel supply unit for supplying fuel from a motor vehicle fuel tank to the vehicle engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In-tank fuel pumps have been well known for some time. In order to ensure that there is always sufficient fuel available at the pump inlet, it is known to locate the pump in a reservoir within the tank, and to make use of a so-called jet pump to maintain a certain fuel level within the reservoir, whatever the level of fuel in the tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A jet pump makes use of the venturi effect by directing a high speed jet of liquid through an orifice so that the jet entrains liquid from around the orifice and pumps that liquid through the orifice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An example of a fuel supply unit with a jet pump is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,341,842. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is self-evident that the jet pump must refill the reservoir at least as fast as fastest rate at which fuel is withdrawn from the reservoir by the pump. It is therefore necessary to make the jet pump as efficient as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable to make such fuel supply units as compact as possible, and for them to be economic to manufacture in large quantities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, an in-tank fuel supply unit for supplying fuel from a fuel tank to a motor vehicle engine, includes a reservoir to be mounted within a fuel tank, a fuel pump mounted in the reservoir and adapted to draw fuel from the reservoir, a fuel outlet from the pump and two fuel passages connected to the outlet, one of the passages feeding fuel to the engine, and the other passage feeding fuel to a jet pump, wherein the jet pump comprises a nozzle arranged to inject fuel into a venturi, the nozzle and the venturi being arranged on a vertical axis with the nozzle injecting fuel upwards into the venturi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Directing the venturi upwards saves space in the reservoir in a horizontal plane, but more importantly the fact that the flow from the nozzle into the reservoir is all in a straight line helps to enhance the performance of the venturi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The venturi passage is preferably formed integrally with the reservoir, as a molded part, and has a converging section followed by a parallel-sided section followed by a diverging section. This form of the venturi passage has a big influence on venturi performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The venturi nozzle is preferably manufactured separately from the reservoir and is molded from a plastics material different from that of the reservoir and venturi passage. By molding the nozzle separately from the passage and the reservoir it becomes possible to optimize the materials for each part. In addition, the combination of a vertical venturi path and a separately molded nozzle allows for access to both ends of the venturi passage during molding so that the converging and diverging sections can be correctly and accurately molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The nozzle diameter is preferably in the range of about 0.35-0.5 mm and most preferably 0.45 mm. The nozzle length is preferably between about 1 and 2 mm, and most preferably 1.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The distance from the tip of the nozzle to the mouth of the venturi passage is preferably between about 4 and 6 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The included angle of the converging section is preferably between about 50 and 70&deg;; the length of the parallel section of the venturi passage is preferably between about 7 and 10 mm and the diameter is preferably between about 4 and 6 mm; and the included angle of the diverging section is preferably between about 8 and 12&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The dimensional ranges proposed have been chosen to optimize venturi performance.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows part of a fuel supply unit for mounting within a motor vehicle fuel tank. The unit comprises a reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the form of a substantially closed container with a lid <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A mounting location <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for a fuel level sensor is provided on one face of the unit. Within the unit is a fuel pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Only the top of this pump can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but the body of the pump is located within the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the pump is designed to pump fuel out of the reservoir through an outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Also visible on top of the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a socket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by which electrical connections to the pump can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Near its bottom surface, the reservoir has an intake recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in which a jet pump is mounted. In use, a filter sock <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is plugged into the recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through a connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The filter sock <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> consists, in this embodiment, of a double-sided rectangular mesh pocket within which a &lsquo;double H&rsquo; plastic spacer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is running, there is a constant feed of pumped fuel to the jet pump in the recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The jet pump causes fuel to be drawn from the tank, through the filter sock <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, into the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to maintain the level of fuel inside the reservoir to ensure that there is always fuel for the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The construction of the jet pump will be described in more detail with reference to the following figures. There are three main components, namely a supply passage, a nozzle and a venturi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The supply passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected by means of a flexible pipe (not shown) to the output <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Between the output <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the supply passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> there is a flow splitter, so that part of the output flow from the pump output <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> goes directly to the vehicle engine, and part is used to supply the jet pump supply passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is inserted into the top of the supply passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, to prevent impurities passing into the supply passage and possibly leading to blocking of the jet pump nozzle. This filter is of the type often referred to as a pencil filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the direction of fuel flow through the jet pump is indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The fuel flows down the supply passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into a chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The fuel from the chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> passes upwards through a nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into a venturi tube <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As the fuel passes in a narrow, fast jet upwards from the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into the venturi <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, it entrains and carries with it fuel from the recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which overflows from the top of the tube <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to fill the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a closure plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> separated from the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows these components assembled to the reservoir, but shows, separated, three rubber isolator feet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which will be mounted on the base of the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The height of the feet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is such that the closure plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is supported off the floor of the fuel tank in which the reservoir is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the underside of the reservoir. The three feet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (or sockets for receiving the feet) are clearly visible, as is the closure plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A one-way valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> protected by a mesh screen <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is placed in the bottom of the container. This valve, which may be of the &lsquo;umbrella&rsquo; type, allows fuel to enter the tank when the level of fuel outside the tank is greater than that inside the tank (e.g. when the tank is being refilled with the engine switched off and the jet pump not running) but shuts to prevent reverse fuel flow when the level of fuel in the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is higher than that in the surrounding tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> circular rib <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is molded onto the floor of the reservoir <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to locate the fuel pump. The jet pump components <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are all positioned close to one wall of the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that they take up a minimum amount of space within the reservoir but are nevertheless contained within the generally cylindrical form of the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The detailed construction of the jet pump is important to ensuring satisfactory performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid the entrained fuel flow from having to turn corners, the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is arranged so that fuel passing through the nozzle travels in a vertical, upwards direction. Certain parameters of the dimensions of the nozzle (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) are also important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> First of all, the venturi passage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a first, converging portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a second parallel-sided portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a third, diverging portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made as a separate component. This has two advantages. Firstly, it makes is possible for the venturi passage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be injection molded using mold pins which enter from the top of the venturi passage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and through the socket for the nozzle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, before the nozzle is mounted on its seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Secondly, the nozzle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can, with advantage, be made of a material different to that of the remaining structure of the reservoir. Typically the reservoir (including the venturi passage which will be formed as part of the main reservoir molding) will be molded from an acetyl plastics material, whilst the nozzle can be molded from a glass-filled polyphenyl sulphide material which will give superior wear resistance, particularly in the area of the nozzle passage where the high flow rate through a narrow nozzle can lead to undesirable wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferred ranges for the various dimensions are:

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a venturi unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for location in a remote tank region. The unit has a supply pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a venturi passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The unit also has a mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by means of which the unit can be secured in place on the floor of the remote tank region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The internal form of the venturi passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that of the passage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. However <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the molding with the nozzle not yet in place (the closure plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is also omitted). The molding has a seat <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for receiving the nozzle, but this seat has a large enough aperture to allow access for mould pins required to mold the converging section of the venturi passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a saddle tank <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which has a fuel supply unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the right hand part <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the tank, with a fuel pump outlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> leading to the vehicle engine. The Figure shows schematically a float arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a jet pump <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In the left hand part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the tank is located the unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The supply pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected by a flexible hose <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to an outlet of the pump in unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Fuel pumped through this hose enters the venturi <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, entrains fuel from the left hand tank part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and pumps this fuel through a hose <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> back into the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that that fuel can be pumped by the pump in the reservoir <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is supported in the tank part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> by a mounting arm <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> depending from the top of the tank. A float arm <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is mounted on a sensor unit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the same arm <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Suitable electronics produces a signal from the sensors in both tank parts to represent the total quantity of fuel available in the tank. The unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> thus pumps fuel from the left hand part of the tank to the reservoir in the right hand part, when the main pump in the reservoir is operating. </paragraph>
