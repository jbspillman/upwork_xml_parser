<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a speaker including a plurality of diaphragms and a mobile terminal device having such a speaker mounted thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A speaker including one magnetic circuit and two diaphragms is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 62-277000, Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Publication No. 4-135096, and Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-252683. The speaker disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-252683 will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-252683. The speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> includes a pole piece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a recessed portion which has a hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a center thereof, a yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is recessed at a center thereof and having a hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a ring-shaped magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fixed between the pole piece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> acts as a frame. The speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> has a first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on an outer side of the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on an inner side of the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> further includes a first voice coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having an outer peripheral area supported by the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a central area connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> having an outer peripheral area supported by the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and having a central area connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a first protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided so as to face the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a second protector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided so as to face the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> is mounted on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a device. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> aligned with the hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> will be described. When an electric signal is input to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. The sound is output through the hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed so as not to disturb the movement of the sound wave. When an electric signal is input to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. The sound is output through the hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the pole piece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As well as the holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed so as not to disturb the movement of the sound wave. In the state where the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> is mounted on a cellular phone, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is used as a receiver, and the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a larger diameter than that of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is used as a sounder for reproducing a calling sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although not described in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 11-252683, the sound from the first and the second diaphragms <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is usually directly output through holes formed in the first and second protectors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Such a structure has the following problem. In a cellular phone, which is most popular among various mobile terminal devices, a liquid crystal display section provided on a front surface of a casing is now increasing in size in order to display a larger number of characters and a larger amount of image information. Such an increased size of the liquid crystal display section reduces a space available for a speaker for reproducing a calling sound which is adjacent to the liquid crystal display section. The speaker diameter was about 20 mm several years ago, but has now been reduced to about 10 mm or less. A simple reduction in size of the diaphragms or magnetic circuit made in accordance with the reduced space for the speaker results in problems, for example, in that a sufficient sound pressure level is not obtained and a sufficient volume of low frequency sound is not obtained. A speaker having a relatively large speaker diameter of 20 mm provides sufficient acoustic characteristics, but requires a large space to the side of the display section of the cellular phone due to the structure of the cellular phone of outputting the sound through the holes of the protectors. This conflicts with the increase in the size of the display section. The structure of outputting the sound through the holes of the protectors also limits the position from which the sound may be output to, for example, a portion above the display section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> further requires that an edge portion of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which determines the minimum resonance frequency (i.e., a portion of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> between a position connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a position connected to the yoke <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), be sufficiently large. Otherwise, the stiffness of the edge portion is too large to sufficiently reproduce a low frequency sound. In order to make the edge portion large, the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> needs to be reduced in size so that the diameter of the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is reduced or the diameter of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> needs to be increased. The diameter of the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also needs to be reduced, or the diameter of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> needs to be increased. However, a reduction in the size of the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the problem in that the magnetic energy becomes insufficient, resulting in a reduction in the driving efficiency of the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>. An increase in the diameter of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> causes the problem of an increase in the speaker diameter of the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, resulting in an inability to save space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, a bottom surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a top surface of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are acoustically coupled to each other through the hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the pole piece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when an electric signal is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to reproduce a sound by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the sound generated by the bottom surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> changes the air pressure on the top surface of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby vibrating the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This causes the problem in that even when no electric signal is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a sound may be generated by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Likewise, when an electric signal is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so as to reproduce a sound by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be driven by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to generate a sound. Due to these problems, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> cannot be independently driven. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> exists among the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the first magnetic plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> exists among the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the second magnetic plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located between the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and between the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A central area of the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is recessed. A magnetic circuit includes the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the first magnetic plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the second magnetic plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> An space <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> exists between the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a plurality of sound holes <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for communicating a space between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the outside the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of sound holes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for communicating a space between the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the outside of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. The plurality of sound holes <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed so as to avoid the minimum resonating frequencies of the first and second diaphragms <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from being increased by the stiffness of the air between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the air between the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has the structure in which the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> face each other and the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> face each other between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Owing to such a structure, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> can be thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> further includes an acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having a throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and an opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is provided at a location of the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is off the center of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> projects from the space <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a quadrangular cross-section in the horizontal direction. The cross-sectional area of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is smaller than the planar area of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The cross-sectional area of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is constant in a longitudinal or vertical direction thereof. In this specification, such a shape of the acoustic pipe is referred to as a &ldquo;straight shape&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. Likewise, when an electric signal is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Thus, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mainly supplied with a magnetic flux from the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mainly supplied with a magnetic flux from the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is driven by the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is driven by the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Since the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are separately driven by the first and second magnets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> respectively, the driving force generated in each of the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be larger than in the conventional speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) in which the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are driven by one magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> can produce a louder sound than the conventional speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A top surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is covered with the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the space <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and then is output to the outside of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. As can be appreciated, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> outputs the sound generated by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> directly downwards and outputs the sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> after being transmitted through the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be provided at an arbitrary position above the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Even where the other elements of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> cannot be provided in the vicinity of the position from which the sound needs to be output, the sound can be output from the desirable position simply by locating the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the desirable position, with the other elements of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> being located in another portion of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the sound generated by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be output from different positions, which are not necessarily close to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The space between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially completely divided into two by the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a bottom or rear surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a top surface of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are acoustically shielded from each other. This solves one of the problems of the conventional speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) that the sound generated by the bottom surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> directly vibrates the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can act independently based on an electric signal applied thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the second voice coil <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. Likewise, when an electric signal is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the first voice coil <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> vibrates so as to generate a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Whereas the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in the first example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> includes the two magnets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in the second example includes one magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which supplies a magnetic flux to both of the first and second magnetic gaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Thus, the structure of the magnetic circuit is simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the conventional speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>), one magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplies a magnetic flux to each of the first and second magnetic gaps <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Since the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided on the outer side and the inner side of the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the size of the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> cannot be increased in the horizontal direction, i.e., the planar direction of the diaphragms <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Since the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> has a limited space in which the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be located, the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inevitably small and the driving efficiency is significantly lowered, especially when the speaker <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> has a small speaker diameter. When the magnet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is forcibly expanded in the horizontal direction, the width of the edge portion of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is reduced, resulting in problems including an increase in the minimum resonance frequency occur. Here, the terms &ldquo;width&rdquo; is defined to mean the size along dashed line c-d. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in the second example, the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are both located in the space surrounded by the magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be expanded outwards in the horizontal direction, which, in turn, allows a large magnitude of magnetic flux to be supplied to the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Thus, a loud sound can be generated. Since the width of the edge portion of each of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be enlarged, the minimum resonating frequencies of the first and second diaphragms <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be lowered. As a result, even a low frequency sound can be reproduced with superb acoustic characteristics. Desired acoustic characteristics can be realized since a sufficient magnetic energy is supplied from the magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, located outside the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, to the first and second magnetic gaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the space <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and then is output to the outside of the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> provides the same effect as that described in the first example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> With the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in the first example (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>), the top surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> needs to be covered with the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to form the space <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. With the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in the second example, the sound is output through the space <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not necessary. Thus, the structure of the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is provided in a casing of a mobile terminal device or the like when practically used. Therefore, the sound output from the top surface of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the sound output through the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are acoustically separated from each other and thus do not counteract each other. The plurality of holes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed in order to prevent the minimum resonance frequency of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from being increased by the stiffness of the air between the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the magnet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sound output from the bottom surface of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the sound output through the holes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are also acoustically separated from each other in practical use. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> have the same magnetization direction.

The magnetic flux &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>from the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> flows through a top portion and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; of the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and through the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and then reaches the second magnetic plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The magnetic flux &phgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> flows through the first magnetic plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the vertical section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; of the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and then reaches a bottom portion of the yoke <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; have opposite magnetization directions. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the passages of a magnetic flux &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>from the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; and a magnetic flux &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>from the first magnet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are the same as the passages of the magnetic fluxes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, except for the direction of the flow.

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> will be described. The operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> An electric signal representing a received sound (for example, the voice of a caller) is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> connected to the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Thus, the received sound reproduced by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is output through the first sound hole <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> acts as a receiver for reproducing the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> An electric signal representing a call arrival sound, music, voice or the like informing the user of a call arrival (arrival of a call) is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Thus, the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like generated by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is output through the second sound hole <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker for reproducing the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In a conventional mobile terminal device, a speaker acting as a receiver for reproducing a received sound and a speaker acting as a loudspeaker for reproducing a call arrival sound or the like are provided in a casing as separate units. Since the units each have its own magnetic circuit, the space for the speakers are inevitably enlarged and thus hampers size and thickness reduction. The speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention includes a plurality of diaphragms, and therefore one speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> can reproduce all the types of sounds. The speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> includes one magnetic circuit for the plurality of diaphragms and occupies a reduced space in the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> including the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> can be reduced in size and thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can output a relatively loud sound. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> including the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> can output a larger sound than a mobile terminal device including a conventional speaker of the same size as that of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Since a larger sound is output by the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> when of the same size as that of a conventional speaker, the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> can be reduced in size. The capacity of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> occupied by the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> may be polygonal, f or example, rectangular. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> as having a circular bottom surface, but the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> may have a rectangular or elliptical bottom surface. In such a case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is preferably located so that a longer direction of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is parallel to one of the sides of the profile of the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. Then, the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> can be extended in the shorter direction of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, thus increasing the size of the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> modified from the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is provided in the first casing <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8C</cross-reference>). The speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> includes a first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; for supporting an outer peripheral area of each of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&Prime; for supporting an outer peripheral area of each of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. The frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; has a plurality of first sound holes <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>&prime;, and the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&Prime; has a plurality of first sound holes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime;. The speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> has substantially the same structure as that of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> except for the above-mentioned points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A basic operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is different from the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in that the area of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is smaller than the area of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and that the outer diameter of the first frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&prime; is smaller than the outer diameter of the second frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>&Prime; accordingly. Owing to such a structure, the diameter of the top portion of the speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> facing the first sound hole <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to or in the vicinity of the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> can be reduced. As a result, the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> for displaying image information such as e-mails and video can be enlarged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Even when there is not a sufficient space for a speaker in the vicinity of the display section <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, the speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is effective. In this example, when the speaker <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is used as a receiver, the sound is generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime;. The user usually contacts his/her ear to the first sound hole <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> to listen to the received sound. Therefore, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; does not need to generate a sound having a high sound pressure as a loudspeaker. Even when the volume of the sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is relatively small due to the small outer diameter of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime;, no practical problem occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Since the outer diameter of the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is smaller, the edge portion of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is wider. This lowers the minimum resonance frequency of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime;. The minimum resonance frequency of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably lower than the minimum resonance frequency of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By lowering the minimum resonance frequency of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime;, the sound pressure level of the low frequency sound generated by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>&prime; is raised. This prevents the occurrence of a lack of low frequency sound which is caused by a sound leak in the gap between the ear of the user and the first sound hole <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> will be further described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> When the antenna <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal, the signal output section <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight> outputs a selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> representing a call arrival and a call arrival sound signal representing a call arrival sound in order to inform the user of the call arrival. By the selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the selection section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> selects the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and supplies the output call arrival sound signal to the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The call arrival sound signal may be a signal representing a pre-set calling sound or an audio signal obtained by data distribution or the like. The second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> reproduces the call arrival sound when receiving the call arrival sound signal. When the user learns of the call arrival and puts the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> into a call receivable state, the signal output section <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight> outputs the selection signal C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> again. The selection section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> selects the first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and supplies a &ldquo;received sound signal&rdquo; representing a received sound (voice of the caller), which is output from the signal output section <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight>, to the first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. The first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> reproduces the received sound when supplied with the received sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As described above, the speaker <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> acts as an electric signal/acoustic signal conversion device having two functions of (i) a receiver and (ii) a loudspeaker by selectively sending a call arrival sound signal or a received sound signal, which is output from the signal output section <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight>, to one of the two electric signal/acoustic signal conversion sections <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> using the selection section <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the electric signal applied to the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is a call arrival sound signal. The electric signal applied to the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may also be a received sound signal, a music signal representing music, or a voice signal representing a voice. In this case, for example, a music signal obtained by music distribution can be reproduced. The second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be structured to reproduce a received sound signal. In this case, the user can converse with the caller in a hands free mode without contacting his/her ear to the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In this example, a received sound signal is described as a signal transmitted during a telephone call, and a voice signal is described as a signal representing a voice obtained by data distribution, which is not a received sound signal.

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In this example, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is described as a cellular phone, but the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is not limited to a cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> includes a casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> provided in the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a receiving antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> attached to the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>) described in the first example The casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes a first sound hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a second sound hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> accommodates a connector and electric circuits including a receiving circuit (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is provided in the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> faces the first sound hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> faces the second sound hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. At least a portion of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is provided between the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface of the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> may be replaced with any of the speakers <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in the second, third and fourth examples with an appropriate arrangement of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> will be described. The operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> An electric signal representing a received sound is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> connected to the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Thus, the received sound reproduced by the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is output through the first sound hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> acts as a receiver for reproducing the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> An electric signal representing a call arrival sound, music, voice or the like is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Thus, the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like generated by the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is output through the second sound hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker for reproducing the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided at a location off the center of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extends so that the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is in the vicinity of the first sound hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be provided outside the outer peripheral edge of the first voice coil <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> maybe provided in the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Since the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it is not necessary to provide the magnetic circuit of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> so as to face the first sound hole <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The magnetic circuit of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> can be provided between the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the bottom surface of the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. This allows the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> to be provided in the casing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> even when the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is relatively large. Since the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> projects from the space <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the distance between the magnetic circuit of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be extended, so that a space can be formed between the magnetic circuit of the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Since the throat <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located off the center of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the space can be formed more efficiently. The space can accommodate the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and electric circuits including a receiving circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In a conventional mobile terminal device, a speaker needs to be provided so as to face the sound hole adjacent to the display section. Since the space for the speaker is thus limited, it is unavoidable to use a small-size speaker. According to the present invention, a larger speaker having improved acoustic characteristics is usable than in the conventional mobile terminal device. Also according to the present invention, it is not necessary to provide the speaker adjacent to the display section. This eliminates the size limitation of the display section imposed by the position of the speaker and allows the display section to be enlarged. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> will be described. The operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> includes the speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> acting as a receiver. A received sound is reproduced by the speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> as in a conventional mobile terminal device. In the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, an electric signal representing a call arrival sound, music, voice or the like is applied to the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Thus, the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like is output through the first sound hole <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the second sound hole <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker for reproducing the call arrival sound, music, voice or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> As described in the third example, the first magnetic gaps <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> have the same size, the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have the same size, and the first and second diaphragms <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> have the same size. Such an arrangement allows sounds output from the first sound hole <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the second sound hole <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> to have substantially the same acoustic characteristics. In the case where the same electric signal is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the second voice coil <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the sound pressure can be raised by, for example, about 3 dB than a conventional speaker having one diaphragm with the same power consumption. Moreover, the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can reproduce audio signals of a plurality of channels. For example, for reproducing an audio signal representing a stereo signal, a music signal for the right channel can be applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and a music signal for the left channel can be applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>.

The speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes a first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, which includes the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the first voice coil <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the magnetic circuit. The speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> also includes a second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, which includes the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the second voice coil <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the magnetic circuit. The magnetic circuit of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes the magnet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the first magnetic plate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the second magnetic plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the yoke <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, and is shared by the first and second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion sections <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal which is externally sent (e.g., sent from a relay station for cellular phones). The wireless signal represents a call arrival sound, received sound, music, voice, image, video or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> When the antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> outputs a call arrival sound signal representing a call arrival sound to the first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in order to inform the user of the call arrival. The call arrival sound signal may be a signal representing a pre-set calling sound or an audio signal obtained by data distribution or the like. The first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> reproduce the call arrival sound when receiving the call arrival sound signal. In the case where the call arrival sound signal is a stereo signal, a stereo call arrival sound is reproduced from the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. When the user puts the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> into a call receivable state, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> stops outputting the call arrival sound signal to the first and second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion sections <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> outputs a received sound signal representing a received sound to the speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> reproduces the received sound when receiving the received sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the electric signal applied to the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is a call arrival sound signal. The electric signal may be a received sound signal, a music signal representing music, or a voice signal representing a voice. In this case, for example, a music signal obtained by music distribution can be reproduced. The speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> may be structured to reproduce a received sound signal. In this case, a loud reproduction sound is obtained from both the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can converse with the caller in a hands free mode without contacting his/her ear to the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> even in a noisy environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, the electric signal applied to the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is directly output from the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, but a call arrival sound signal may be output from a call arrival sound signal output section (not shown) separately provided from the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The call arrival sound signal output section stores a music signal and a voice signal obtained by data distribution or the like and outputs each of them as a call arrival sound signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> A mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> according to an eighth example of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is modified from the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> includes a speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> instead of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The other elements of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> are substantially the same as those of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a partially cut plan view of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is provided for illustrating how the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is provided in the casing <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In this example, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is described as a cellular phone, but the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is not limited to a cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> includes a first acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a second acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> instead of the first acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the second acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. The speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> has substantially the same structure as that of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> except for this point. The speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> may be replaced with any of the speakers <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in the first, second and fourth examples with an appropriate arrangement of the first acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the second acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The first acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the second acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> are located in side portions of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. The sound transmitted through the first acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is output through a first opening <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and the sound transmitted through the second acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> is output through a second opening <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The cross-sectional area of each of the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> gradually increases from the center to the side of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. In this specification, such a shape of the acoustic pipe is referred to as a &ldquo;horn shape&rdquo;. Although not shown here, the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> includes a display section located between the first and second openings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> will be described. A basic operation of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> As described above, the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> each have a straight shape with the cross-sectional area being constant in a longitudinal or vertical direction thereof (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). By contrast, the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> each have a horn shape with the cross-sectional area gradually increasing from the center to the side of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Owing to such a shape, the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> can have a larger capacity than the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, but alleviate the acoustic load applied on the first and second diaphragms <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As a result, the sound pressure level of the sound output through each of the first and second openings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can be raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> A width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first and second openings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) can be substantially equal to a width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) of the first and second openings <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. A length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first and second openings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the speaker <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is gradually increased from a length L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is equal to the length of the first and second openings <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> An acoustic pipe including an opening having such a lengthy shape according to the present invention has the following effect. In a direction parallel to the longer sides of the opening, the directivity is high due to a large sound source length. In a direction parallel to the shorter sides of the opening, the directivity is low due to a small sound source length. As a result, the sound output in a particular direction can be strengthened or weakened. For example, in the case of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is longer than the width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The directivity is low in the direction parallel to the sides having the width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When a plurality of people listen to the music reproduced by the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>, listeners can listen to the music with substantially the same quality regardless of the position in the direction parallel to the sides having the width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the direction parallel to the sides having the length L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the directivity is high. Therefore, listeners listen to the music with different energy levels depending on the position in the direction parallel to the sides having the width L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> can strengthen or weaken the energy level of the sound output in a particular direction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, sound holes <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> may be provided above and below the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, i.e., along two shorter sides of the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. When a stereo signal is reproduced, the mobile terminal device having such a structure is inclined at 90 degrees from the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Since the distance between the sound holes <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is longer than the distance between the sound holes provided along the longer sides of the display section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the stereo effect is improved. This enhances the acoustic effect obtained when audio signals of a plurality of channels are reproduced. Furthermore, when a live broadcast of a concert is received by the mobile terminal device, the video is reproduced with sides <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being used as upper or lower sides of a screen. Namely, the video is reproduced in a screen which is longer in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction like a TV screen. The arrangement of the sound holes <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is advantages in such a case in that the direction of the video matches the direction of the reproduced sound field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In the sixth through tenth examples, the speaker is provided closer to the rear surface of the mobile terminal device. The same effect is provided regardless of the position of the speaker in the mobile terminal device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 11 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> A mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> according to an eleventh example of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight>. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> is modified from the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A, 13B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> includes an acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> for adjusting an acoustic image of the sound reproduced by the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, in addition to the elements included in the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> has substantially the same structure as that of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> except for this point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal which is externally sent (e.g., sent from a relay station for cellular phones). The wireless signal represents a call arrival sound, received sound, music, voice, image, video or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> When the antenna <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> outputs a call arrival sound signal representing a call arrival sound to the acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> in order to inform the user of the call arrival. The acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> adjusts the call arrival sound signal so that the acoustic image of the sound reproduced by the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> expands. The acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> outputs the resultant call arrival sound signal to the first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The call arrival sound signal may be a signal representing a pre-set calling sound or an audio signal obtained by data distribution or the like. The first electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the second electric signal/acoustic signal conversion section <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> reproduce the call arrival sound when receiving the call arrival sound signal. Since the call arrival sound signal is adjusted so that the acoustic image expands, the call arrival sound output from the first and second acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> sounds realistic. When the user puts the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> into a call receivable state, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> stops outputting the call arrival sound signal to the acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the signal output section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> outputs a received sound signal representing a received sound to the speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> reproduces the received sound when receiving the received sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the electric signal applied to the speaker <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is a call arrival sound signal. The electric signal may be a received sound signal, a music signal representing music, or a voice signal representing a voice. In this case, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight>, although being compact in size, can reproduce, for example, a stereo music signal so that the user can perceive the expansion of sound comparable to music reproduced by a large-scale music reproduction apparatus. With audio signals of two or more channels, more realistic music close to that of a live performance can be obtained by adjusting the acoustic image adjusting section <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of each channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> A speaker having two magnetic gaps of different sizes (for example, the speaker <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in the first example and the speaker <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in the second example) each have two voice coils having different diameters and two diaphragms having different areas. By adjusting, for example, the shapes and materials of the voice coils and the diaphragms, the acoustic characteristics (efficiency, reproduction frequency band width, etc.) of the sounds reproduced by the two diaphragms can be equal to each other. In this manner, a speaker having different sizes of magnetic gaps, voice coils and diaphragms can provide a high quality reproduction of stereo audio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the frames and the diaphragms are not limited to being circular, but may be elliptical, polygonal or the like in accordance with the space in which the speaker is provided. The cross-section of the acoustic pipe from the throat to the opening may be circular, quadrangular, elliptical or any other appropriate shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the speaker according to the present invention is used in a mobile terminal device. The speaker according to the present invention may be used in a game apparatus, a personal computer, an MD player or the like which does not include a signal receiving device. In this case, the speaker is used for reproducing a sound effect, a music signal, a voice signal or the like. In such a case, the speaker according to the present invention provides a compact device capable of reproducing audio information of a plurality of channels including a stereo signal, like the speaker provided in a mobile terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a speaker is provided in which the yoke connects the first magnet and the second magnet to each other, the first voice coil is located between the first magnet and the yoke, and the second voice coil is located between the second magnet and the yoke. Owing to such a structure, the first voice coil is supplied with a magnetic flux mainly from the first magnet, and the second voice coil is supplied with a magnetic flux mainly from the second magnet. The two voice coils are driven by separate magnets. Therefore, a driving force generated in each voice coil can be increased, and thus a loud sound can be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a mobile terminal device including the above-described speaker is provided. Since the speaker according to the present invention can generate a loud sound, the mobile terminal device according to the present invention can generate a louder sound than a mobile terminal device including a conventional speaker having the same size as that of the speaker of the present invention. Since a louder sound can be generated, the size of the speaker can be reduced and thus can reduce the size of the space of the mobile terminal device occupied by the speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, at least one of a first acoustic pipe provided between the first diaphragm and the first sound hole, and a second acoustic pipe provided between the second diaphragm and the second sound hole is provided. Owing to such a structure, the speaker in the mobile terminal device can be located with a high level of freedom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the magnetization direction of the first magnet and the magnetization direction of the second magnet may be opposite to each other. In this case, magnetic saturation in the yoke can be avoided. This causes a greater magnitude of magnetic flux to be provided to the first and second voice coils, and thus allows a louder sound to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a speaker is provided, in which a magnet is provided so as to surround the yoke and the first voice coil and the second voice coil are provided between the yoke and the magnet. Both of the two voice coils for driving the two diaphragms are provided SO as to be surrounded by the magnet. Therefore, the magnet can be extended outward. This causes a greater magnitude of magnetic flux to be provided to the first and second voice coils, and thus allows a louder sound to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a thin speaker is provided, in which a sound generated from the front side or the rear side of at least one diaphragm is output from an arbitrary position through an acoustic pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the space between two diaphragms is divided using a yoke so as to acoustically shield the two diaphragms from each other. Thus, a speaker in which two diaphragms operate separately by an electric signal applied to each of voice coils is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the area of one diaphragm facing the sound hole adjacent to the display section of the mobile terminal device may be smaller than the area of the other diaphragm. In this case, the space in the vicinity of the display section in which the speaker is provided can be further reduced, so as to enlarge the display section. In a mobile terminal device having such an enlarged display section, the letters in e-mails and videos are easier to see. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The speaker according to the present invention, when mounted on a mobile terminal device, can act both as a receiver for reproducing a received sound signal, and as a loudspeaker for reproducing a call arrival sound signal, a music signal, a voice signal or the like. The functions which are performed by a plurality of speakers can be performed by one speaker. Naturally, one speaker occupies a smaller space than the plurality of speakers. Therefore, the size of the mobile terminal device can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the magnetic circuit of the speaker can be provided in the vicinity of the rear surface of the mobile terminal device, so that the sound may be output through the opening of the acoustic pipe having a smaller cross-sectional area than the cross-sectional area of the diaphragm. Thus, the mobile terminal device can have a larger display section while maintaining the size of the diaphragm. It is therefore not necessary to reduce the size of the speaker for reasons of a lack of space in the mobile terminal device. A mobile terminal device generating a high quality sound can still be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the opening of the two acoustic pipes may be provided in the front surface of the mobile terminal device so as to interpose the display section. In this case, a compact mobile terminal device for reproducing a call arrival sound signal and a music signal is provided. In the case where the acoustic image adjusting section adjusts an electric signal to be applied to the speaker (for example, so that the acoustic image is enlarged), even a mobile terminal device including two sound sources closely adjacent to each other can reproduce a sound having an acoustic image comparable to a sound reproduced by a large-scale music reproduction apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. </paragraph>
