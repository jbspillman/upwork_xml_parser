<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to disposable garments and methods and apparatus for making such garments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art teaches a wide variety of disposable diaper configurations, in which the finished diaper is a flat panel having adhesive tabs or the like, permitting the joinder of one end of the panel to the other, to fit the diaper panel from the infant&apos;s back, under the crotch and to the front of the waist. Examples of such arrangements are shown in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,081,772 to Brooks et al; 3,417,751 to Murdoch; 4,892,528 to Suzuki et al; and 5,064,489 to Ujimoto et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have also been developed in the prior art a variation of finished disposable training pants for infants, in which the finished product has opposing side seams joining the front and back panels of the garment assembly. Examples of these arrangements are shown in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,743,239 to Cole; 4,743,241 to Igaue et al; 4,646,362 to Heran et al; 4,938,757 to Van Gompel et al; and 5,055,103 to Nomura et al; and 5,064,421 to Tracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,241 to Igaue et al discloses an elastic sheet adhered across the panel adjacent to the opposing leg openings, which serves as a liquid barrier for body fluids leaking from the center absorbent pad. A similar arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,417,751 to Murdoch. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method of making disposable garments, particularly of the training pants variety, which include a rolled cuff inwardly from the plane of each leg opening, at least about the lower portion of the leg opening. Further, the present invention is directed to methods for achieving this rolled cuff feature in a low cost and facile manner. The present invention also has the objective of providing methods for achieving improvements and efficiencies in the manufacture of disposable garments of all types, including both disposable diapers, training pants, and incontinent garments for those who are elderly or infirmed. The present invention advantageously includes a method of making disposable garments. The method preferably includes conveying a carrier layer having a pair of opposing edges positioned to extend along a direction of manufacture. The method can also advantageously include disposing a plurality of elongate absorbent pads positioned in spaced-apart relation on the carrier layer between the pair of opposing edges with a direction of elongation extended transverse to the direction of manufacture. The method can further advantageously include forming a plurality of openings in the carrier layer, each of the plurality of openings positioned between respective adjacent pads and defining a leg hole associated with each adjacent pad. The method can still further advantageously include folding the carrier layer and the pads positioned thereon generally into two halves extending along a fold line positioned intermediate the pair of opposing edges and generally parallel with the direction of manufacture. The method can also include joining the two halves together along a plurality of seam lines, two adjacent seam lines extending generally transverse to the direction of manufacture between respective adjacent pads to as to intersect each of the plurality of openings and pair of opposing edges. The method can still further advantageously include severing the carrier layer into a plurality of individual garment units between said adjacent seam lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one form, the method of making the disposable garment in accordance with the present invention includes making a disposable garment having a panel of a material at least a portion of which is liquid impervious, the panel defining leg openings. The garment is provided with elastic means extending continuously about the peripheral edge of each leg opening with the elastic means including a sheet of an elastic material stretched along an inside surface of the panel and about a substantial portion of the periphery of the corresponding leg opening, the elastic sheet being under sufficient stretch to draw the periphery of the leg opening into a curved elastic cuff when the garment is fitted about an infant. In this arrangement, the elastic sheet extends continuously around and to the peripheral edge of the corresponding leg opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another form, the elastic sheet extends about the lower portion of the leg opening, with plural elastic bands extending about the remaining periphery of the leg opening at the upper portion on either side of the leg opening. In this arrangement, the elastic bands preferably also extend across the area covered by the corresponding elastic sheet, then laterally across the crotch area of the panel and then across a portion of the area covered by another elastic sheet about the opposing leg opening, with a similar pair of elastic bands being also disposed around the other side of the two leg openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A third form of making the disposable garment employs a second layer of elastic sheet extending between the leg openings, and longitudinally stretched between the leg holes. The second stretched elastic layer avoids the necessity for providing the elastic bands of the type described above, while at the same time providing a uniform gathering of material in the crotch area of the garment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the elastic sheet material is under a stretch on the order of five ounces per lineal inch for each inch of cross-width when installed across the panel, and extends at least 0.5 inches from the peripheral edge laterally across that portion of the panel where the elastic sheet is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of the garments, a unitary elastic sheet is stretched across the machine web in a direction lateral to the direction of manufacture, the elastic sheet having dimensions so as to cover an area of the web where leg openings for two adjacent garments will later be formed. Leg openings are then cut through each elastic sheet in the outer web, each leg opening lying within the boundaries of the corresponding elastic sheet and defining the peripheral edges of two leg openings, one each for the adjacent garments. The web is then later folded in half, so that the elastic sheet extends continuously around the leg opening. In this form of manufacture, the direction of stretch of the elastic sheet for each leg opening thus is generally parallel to the edge of the opening along the lower portion, the direction of stretch extending somewhat laterally away from the peripheral edge along that portion closest to the waist opening of the garment. Appropriate seams are formed along the sides between the front and back of the garment from the waist opening to the upper portion of each leg opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention also is directed to manufacturing methods which includes a sequential series of operations formed at individual stations, or &ldquo;sections&rdquo;, where the method and apparatus coact with the materials which make up the disposable garments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> One of the features of the present invention with respect to methods for manufacturing such garments is the inclusion of a reciprocating &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; cutting knife for severing the continuous web of absorbent material into individual pads. The use of a reciprocating knife reduces the hardness and sharpness of the edge of the pad, with respect to conventional rotary cutters. In order to accommodate the use of the reciprocating cutting blade, the present invention utilizes a conveying system in which the web of materials forming the pads are passed into an accumulator section which permits an elevated continuous feed from overhead onto a vacuum conveyor; the vacuum conveyor is then operated intermittently as required by the operation of the reciprocating cutting knife. The accumulator utilizes a retaining flap to keep the degree of accumulating &ldquo;bend&rdquo; in the continuous pad material to an acceptable level. The material forming the pad web is maintained against the vacuum conveyor with a curved bar extending in the direction of manufacture; the vacuum conveyor itself utilizes a woven material as the conveyor surface, with a fixed vacuum plate for drawing the pad web down against the woven conveyor surface. The reciprocating action of the knife across the laterally extending pad web is operated by an eccentric drive mechanism, and the cutting aperture below the reciprocating knife blade is angled in a V-shape, in order to facilitate a smooth cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> After cutting of the individual pads, the pads are then conveyed to a combining station and adhered to an outer carrier layer, or web. In order to insure that the pads are delivered exactly in a straight format to the combining station, the pad conveyor between the cutter and the combining section is provided with means for straightening any misaligned pads moving across the conveyor; this objective is achieved in a conveyor which also further achieves the objective of reaching near the throat of the reciprocal cutting knife, in order to receive each cut pad. This is achieved using multiple thin, plastic webbing strips for the conveyor surface, and a chain and dog drive positioned underneath the webbing conveyor, the chain having an eccentric drive to move each dog first slowly, then faster, then slowly again. The chain drives extend parallel with the thin webbing, with the dogs extending through the webbing and into engagement with each pad. In operation, each straightening dog rises slowly between two of the conveyor webbing strips, then speeds up to engage the backside of a corresponding pad on opposite sides of the webbing, thereby straightening any misaligned pad. As the pad then nears the discharge end of the webbing conveyor, the eccentric drive of the chain assembly slows down each dog relative to the speed of the webbing conveyor, thereby causing each dog to effectively back away from the respective pad; each dog then is rotated below the level of the webbing conveyor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of the method relates to techniques for folding of an outer non-woven layer over the inner layers. In a preferred arrangement, the web making up the disposable garment includes an outer non-woven layer having a polyvinyl liquid impervious liner adhered to the outer non-woven layer, with the absorbent pad adhered to the liner, and with an inner non-woven layer adhered across the pad and the liquid impervious liner. The elastic sheet is disposed and adhered to across the inner surface of the outer non-woven layer, before disposition of the liquid impervious liner across the outer non-woven layer. Waistband elastic may also be adhered along the edges of the outer non-woven layer before fixing the polyvinyl barrier liner. Preferably, the outer non-woven layer has a lateral dimension relative to the direction of manufacture which is somewhat greater than the other layers, so that an edge portion of the outer layer extends beyond the other layers. This outer edge portion is then folded inwardly across the waistband elastic and the edges of the polyvinyl liner and then inner non-woven layer. This folded edge provides further comfort for the person wearing the garment, and also protects the waistband edge. This folding is achieved in a facile manner according to the present invention utilizing a feed roller having beveled ends, the dimensions for which correspond generally to the outwardly extending edge portion of the outer non-woven layer. These beveled ends permit the relaxation of the outer edge portion as the machine web passes underneath the roller under tension; thereafter, edge folding fixtures extend underneath and complete the folding of the edge portions with an adhesive. Of course, this edge folding function is achieved downstream from the combining section, where the absorbent pad is joined with the outer non-woven layer and the polyvinyl liner, and after the inner non-woven layer is affixed across the liner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Following the edge folding operation, the machine web is passed into a leg hole cutting section, where leg holes are cut through the inner and outer non-woven layers, the polyvinyl liner and centrally through the elastic sheets. The dimensions of the elastic sheet are such as to extend outside of the leg hole dimensioned on the order of at least 0.5 inches, or more, as discussed above. Further, it will be appreciated that each leg hole defines a corresponding leg opening for adjacent garments which are eventually severed from the machine web. It is preferred that the leg hole cutting operation take place with a vacuum underneath the cutter, in order to draw away the waste product of that cutting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Following the cutting of the leg holes, the machine web is then folded in half and passed into a seam weld section, where two adjacent seams are formed using an ultrasonic welder. In one arrangement, the anvil of the ultrasonic welder is heated to a temperature somewhat below the melting temperature of the polyvinyl liner, and the teeth on the anvil are sharpened to obtain penetration through all of the layers. The combination of the sharpened anvil teeth and the elevated temperature provide a highly reliable seam weld. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A second form of the ultrasonic seam welder utilizes an inflatable bladder behind the anvil, with the ultrasonic horn driven by an eccentric cam. These features permit a greater dwell time during the seaming operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The products are then passed into a unit cutter section, where the machine web is severed into individual garments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> These and other features of the present invention will be understood by those skilled in the art from the following accompanying drawings and description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Method and Apparatus </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Noting <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</cross-reference>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a fold section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using conventional techniques to fold an absorbent core material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an outer tissue <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in order to form a web of absorbent pad material <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The output of the fold section is passed into an accumulator section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> to be elevated with respect to the fold section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the downstream pad cutter section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is cut into individual pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, each having a forward edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a rear edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, by cutting along a direction lateral to the direction of manufacture, as illustrated by arrows <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The individually cut pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are passed into a pad conveyor section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and then to a combining section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the combining section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is extended along the direction of manufacture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and provided with an appropriate adhesive, generally over the entire exposed surface of the non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Waistband elastic strips <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are extended along the adhesive-coated non-woven outer layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, again in the direction of manufacture shown by arrows <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in order to provide a waistband elastic in a conventional manner. A liquid impervious liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (for example, polyvinyl) is extended across the adhesive-coated non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and then individual pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are affixed to the exposed surface of the liner, using appropriate adhesives. The liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> either alone or in combination with the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> serves as a carrier layer during the manufacturing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a source of elastic sheet material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example polyurethane foam or polyethylene sheeting, which is extended into a stretcher and applicator section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is described in greater detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the stretcher and applicator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> cuts the elastic sheet into individual sheet segments <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, while simultaneously stretching each sheet segment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a direction lateral to the direction of manufacture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as is depicted by arrows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, and generally under the stretch conditions discussed above; that is, a stretch on the order of five ounces per lineal inch for each inch of cross-width (i.e., twenty-five ounces for a five inch length of one inch wide elastic). The individual elastic sheet segments <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be affixed to either the liquid impervious liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, or to the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The polyvinyl liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the individual pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are respectively affixed to the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with a conventional adhesive <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The output of the combining section is fed into another section where an inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fixed to the assembly by an adhesive across the liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> have a lateral dimension somewhat less than the corresponding dimension of the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that the outer non-woven layer has peripheral edge portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> extending beyond the periphery of the other two layers. After deposition of the inner non-woven layer at section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the assembly is then fed into an edge folding section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As schematically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the peripheral edge portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are then folded across the periphery of the inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and joined thereto with an adhesive, as described in greater detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The output from the edge folding section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is then fed into a leg hole cutting section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which is operated under a slight vacuum at <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, so as to remove the scrap without interfering with the manufacture of the assembly. Noting <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, each leg hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is cut centrally in the web defined by the layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between adjacent pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and centrally within the peripheral boundary of a corresponding elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; preferably, the dimensions of the leg hole and the elastic sheet are selected so that a minimum of 0.5 inches of the elastic sheet, and suitably an even greater dimension, extend from the peripheral edge of the leg hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the boundary of the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It will of course be appreciated that the cutting of the leg hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> centrally in the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> insures that the elastic sheet extends to the very edge of the leg hole. As will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, this particular feature enables the disposable garment to achieve a desirable inwardly rolled cuff which assists in defining a liquid barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After passing out of the leg hole cutting section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the assembly is fed into a web folding section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, where the entire web is folded upon itself, as depicted along the left hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The web is then fed into a seam welding section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, where parallel seams are formed between the upper edge of the web and the upper extremity of each leg hole <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; preferably, this is achieved utilizing an ultrasonic welder and a rotating anvil which is heated to a temperature slightly below the melting point of the polyvinyl liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and below the ignition temperature of the non-woven layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The output from the seam welding section is then passed into a unit cutter section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, where the web is cut along line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> into individual garments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Each garment is then conveyed into a blower section <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> where air is blown into the individual garment is subjected to a vacuum at <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to draw the intermediate seam welds inwardly to form a compact unit for packaging purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A First Embodiment of the Disposable Garment (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Construction details of a first form of the disposable garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As constructed, the garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a waistband opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a front panel <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, an opposing rear panel <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a crotch area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>; it will of course be understood that the front and back panels and the crotch area <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are formed from the assembly of materials in accordance with the method depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, and includes (as shown in the cut away portion in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, absorbent pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, with the elastic waistbands <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and seam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The portion of the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> remaining with the individual garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> after formation of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, folding of the web and welding of the seam <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is depicted by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Arrows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also depict the direction of stretch of the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the cutting of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through the field of the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is accomplished so as to extend to the extreme periphery of the opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This, together with the folding of the web to form the front and back panels <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> relieves the stretching of the elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the periphery of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and causes the elastic sheet along the periphery to roll into an inwardly-directed cuff along the periphery of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. However, because of the variance of the stretch represented by arrows <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the lower portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the upper portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the degree of roll of the cuff varies from the lower portion to the upper portion. This is shown by comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, where the lower portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the rolled cuff is shown to be greater than the upper portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This variance of the rolled cuff from the lower portion is desirable, since the upper portion does not require as great a roll in the cuff for purposes of providing a liquid barrier, and also provides greater comfort to the person wearing the garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Other Forms of the Disposable Garment Construction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and B</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A second alternate form of construction of the disposable garment in accordance with the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and referred to generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Disposable garment <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes various features of the garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are referred to by the same reference numerals, including waistband elastic <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, seams <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and leg openings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The construction of disposable garment <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is different from the construction of garment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> through the use of elastic bands <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which extend continuously around the periphery of opposite sides of each leg opening and across a portion of the same area covered by elastic sheets <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and also across the crotch area of the garment <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to the opposite leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Further, the elastic sheets <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> may be drawn back slightly from the respective seams <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so as to extend essentially about the peripheral edge of the lower portion of the leg opening <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> after being folded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A third form of construction of a disposable garment in accordance with the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B and referred to there by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The disposable garment <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> also includes the various features of the garments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, to the extent that those various features are referred to by the same reference numerals. Additionally, the garment <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> includes a second layer of elastic sheeting extending between the leg openings, and longitudinally stretched in the direction of the arrows <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The stretched elastic layer <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> avoids the necessity for providing the elastic bands <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, while at the same time providing a uniform gathering of material in the crotch area of the garment <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The Accumulator Section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Details of the accumulator section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown on the left hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is extended across elevated rollers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> which operate continuously to receive the feed of the web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> then feed the web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> downwardly across an indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, which preferably consists of a wire mesh extending across a fixed vacuum plate <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> having holes therein permitting a vacuum to be drawn, as shown by arrows. the accumulator section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further includes a control plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> pivoted at <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, and extending across the web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> somewhat below the continuous feed rollers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Similarly, there is a pressure rod <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> pivoted at <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> extending across the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and over the indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In operation, the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is drawn into fixed engagement with the mesh surface of the indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> via the vacuum plate <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. The indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> is operated on a &ldquo;stop-start&rdquo;, or intermittent basis, as required by the operation of the reciprocating cutting blade <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described below in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, but the details of which are also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Thus, the rollers <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are continuously feeding the web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> onto a conveyor which only operates on an intermittent basis; therefore, the web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is subjected to a buckling, as shown below the control plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. The degree of buckle is controlled by the plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, to insure that the direction of the web continues along the surface of the intermittent indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. The pressure rod <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> also insures that any buckling does not extend beyond the central area of the indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown on the right hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the indexing conveyor <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> forces the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> across a fixed mandrel <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> in the throat of the cutting section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The Pad Cutting Section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As discussed briefly above, the pad cutting section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> utilizes a reciprocating &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo;-type of cutter, which achieves certain benefits with respect to the formation of the cut edge in the absorbent pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the cutting section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a blade <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> terminating in a cutting edge <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and carried by a cross plate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> extending across the machine direction. The plate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is carried by reciprocating rods <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which are supported by springs <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for biasing in an upward direction. The reciprocating rods <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are supported by respective bearing blocks <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As shown in the front view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the mandrel <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> has a V-configuration, such that the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is sheared downwardly from each side to the central portion of the mandrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Noting <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the reciprocating motion of the rods <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is controlled by an eccentric <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> rotating about a shaft <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and engaging a rotating element <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> mounted on a pivot axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and which is supported by a yoke <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at the upper extremity of each rod <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The use of an eccentric cam surface to control the operation of the cutting blade <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, together with the shape of the cutting throat defined by mandrel <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> insures a smooth, even and sharp cut through the absorbent pad web <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to define individual pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Pad Conveyor Section (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Details of the pad conveyor section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The pad conveyor includes a pair of rotating shafts <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> which extend laterally across the direction of manufacture, and support plural vinyl conveyor straps <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> along the manufacturing direction. As is depicted in FIG. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the conveyor webs <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> are extended into close proximity to the throat of the pad cutter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A pair of chain drives <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> are supported parallel to and underneath the webbing <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>, each chain drive <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> spaced between two of the webbing strips. The chain drives are supported by shafts <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and an eccentric drive <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Plural straightening dogs <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> are dimensioned vertically to extend upwardly from the respective chain drives <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and above the level of the webbing strips <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>. As is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the eccentric drive <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> imparts a &ldquo;slow-fast-slow&rdquo; pace to the movement of the straightening dogs, in order that the dogs may first extend upwardly between adjacent strips <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>, then be speeded up to engage the backside of a corresponding pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to straighten the position of any misaligned pad across the lateral direction, and then slow down and back away from the back edge of the corresponding pad, before rotating underneath the chain drive as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Of course, the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then discharged from the pad conveyor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the right hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and progresses to the combining section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Noting both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, at an appropriate transfer point, the individual elastic sheets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are received along the surface of the transfer roller <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> which also includes vacuum chucks <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. The vacuum chucks <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> hold the individual elastic lengths <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> across the transfer surface of the transfer roller <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, until such time as the individual sheets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are fed into an entry point <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> of stretching rollers <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>. As is particularly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the crosswise dimension of the transfer surface of the transfer roller <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> is substantially less than the lengthwise dimension of each elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and is approximately equal to or less than the spacing between the stretching rollers <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> at the entry point <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

As the skewed rollers <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> are rotated, the gripping belts hold the sheets in place, and the skewed angle effectuates the desired degree of stretching. Thereafter, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the individual sheets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are discharges at area <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> onto the web of the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the seam weld section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) utilizes an ultrasonic welder including weld head <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> having a face <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> with protruding weld pins <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, the pins <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> are sharpened to a sufficient degree to insure penetration through the entire web assembly, including the outer non-woven layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, elastic sheet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and inner non-woven layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Further in accordance with the present invention, the ultrasonic welder is operated in conjunction with a rotating anvil <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> having an anvil face <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> which is heated by an internal heating coil <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> to a temperature which is slightly below the melting temperature of the polyvinyl liner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and of course below the ignition temperature of the inner and outer non-woven layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It has been found that this particular arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> provides desirable seam welds in a facile manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A second form of the seam welding section is depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A-C. In this arrangement, the seam welding section includes opposing pairs of rotating drive wheels <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. Each pair of drive wheels is pivotally connected respectively at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> to a corresponding drive rod <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. (As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, each of the drive wheels is in turn rotated by a corresponding shaft and gear arrangement, including corresponding gears <highlight><bold>795</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight>, with each the drive gear being driven by a respective pinion <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A conventional ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is mounted on the forward extremity of the drive rod <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, and a conventional ultrasonic anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> is mounted at the extremity of the second drive rod <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, the anvil is coupled to a back plate <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> via an air bladder <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> which is capable of being alternately inflated and deflated from an air supply <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight>. This construction permits the anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> to be inflated outwardly toward the horn <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, and also imparts a significant degree of &ldquo;give&rdquo; to the anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> via the air bladder <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In operation, rotation of each pair of drive wheels <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> results in the reciprocal movement of the corresponding drive rod <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> toward the machine web, the web being represented by arrow <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17C</cross-reference>. It will of course be appreciated by those skilled in the ultrasonic welding art that without the presence of the compressible bladder <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>, there is only one tangential point where the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and the anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> may come in contact with each other, in order to avoid any damage to either part. However, with the provision of the inflatable bladder <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>, the anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> is imparted with a significant degree of &ldquo;give&rdquo; or compressibility, thereby permitting the horn <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and the anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> to be in contact with each other for a much greater period of time during movement of the web (represented by arrow <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>) along the direction of travel. This results in a much better forming of weld seams like seam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. This greater dimension of contact is represented by dimension D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>C, in which circles <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> respectively depict the circular motions of the horn <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and anvil <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> during movement of the drive rods <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
