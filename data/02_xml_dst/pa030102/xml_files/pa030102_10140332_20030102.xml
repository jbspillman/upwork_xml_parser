<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a technique for fabrication of a semiconductor integrated circuit device and the semiconductor integrated circuit device fabricated by using this technique. Particularly, the present invention pertains to a technique which is effective when applied to a semiconductor integrated circuit device having a metal interconnection, which has, as a main conductive film, copper or the like, and is formed by depositing a thin copper film in a groove and removing a portion of the thin copper film from a region outside the groove by the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the conventional semiconductor integrated circuit device, an interconnection film was formed, for example, by forming a thin film of a high-melting-point metal, such as aluminum (Al) alloy or tungsten (W), over an insulating film, forming a resist pattern having the same shape as that of the interconnection pattern over a thin film for interconnection by photolithography and then forming the interconnection pattern by dry etching using the resist pattern as a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The conventional process using an Al alloy or the like is, however, accompanied with a drawback in that, attendant on miniaturization of the interconnection, the interconnection resistance shows a marked increase, which inevitably increases an interconnection delay, resulting in a deterioration in the performance of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Such a drawback has led to a serious problem particularly in a high-performance logic LSI and represents a factor for disturbing its performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The IBM J. Res. Develop., 39(4), the July issue, 419-435(1995) or 1996 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers, pp48-49, describes a process (so-called damascene method) for forming an interconnection pattern in a groove, which comprises embedding an interconnection metal, which has copper (Cu) as a main conductive film, formed in an insulating film and then removing an unnecessary portion of the metal outside the groove by the CMP (chemical machine polishing) method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 7-297183, describes a technique which comprises forming an interconnection groove on an insulating film formed over a semiconductor substrate, overlaying another insulating film, overlaying a conductive interconnection film, forming a planarizing film made of SOG (Spin On Glass) so as to embed the interconnection groove with the planarizing film, and polishing the planarizing film the and conductive interconnection film, thereby leaving an interconnection made of the conductive interconnection film in the interconnection groove. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a result of investigation on the above process which comprises embedding an interconnection metal having copper (Cu) or the like as a main conductor film in a groove formed in an insulating film and then removing an unnecessary portion of the metal outside the groove by the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) method, however, the present inventors found that the process is accompanied with the following problems. The problems investigated by the present inventors will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), in which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a plain view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view taken along a line b-b of FIG. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view taken along a line c-c of FIG. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and wherein only a problematic interconnection film is illustrated, while other members are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the formation of an interconnection <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> over an insulating film <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, first, an insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> for interconnection formation is deposited over the insulating film <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is formed in the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. As the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film is usually employed. Second, a metal film (for example, copper (Cu)) which is to constitute the interconnection <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is deposited over the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> so as to embed the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, followed by the removal of a portion of the metal film over the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> outside the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by polishing, whereby only the metal film inside the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> remains and the interconnection <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is formed. When the silicon oxide film used as the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is compared with the metal (ex. copper) which constitutes the interconnection film <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the polishing rate of the latter by the CMP method is generally greater. Such a difference in the polishing rate inevitably results in a concave portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> being formed on the surface of the interconnection <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, This concave portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is known as dishing (concave). In addition, scratches appear on the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as a result of polishing by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If an insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is formed over such a concave portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> or a scratch without removing it from the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, another concave portion <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> or a further concave portion attributable to the scratch also appears on the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. If a plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is formed in the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by the CMP method without removing the concave portion, the conductive substance <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which constitutes the plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> remains in the concave portion on the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Described more specifically, the plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is formed by embedding a metal film, which is to constitute the plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, inside a connecting hole opened in the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, depositing the metal film over the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>; and then removing the metal film over the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by the CMP method to leave only a portion of the metal film inside of the connecting hole. If a concave portion (including a concave portion attributable to a scratch) exists on the surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the conductive, substance <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which is a residue of the metal film, also remains inside of the concave portion. Incidentally, there is a possibility that the metal film will remain in the concave portion attributable to a scratch, but this is not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Such a residue of the conductive substance <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is not intended and is undesired, because when an insulating film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is formed over the plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and an interconnection <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed in the interconnection groove of the insulating film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, two adjacent interconnections <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which are to be electrically disconnected, form a short circuit owing to the existence of the conductive substance <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, leading to a short-circuit problem in the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Such a short circuit problem occurs similarly when an interconnection is formed by the so-called dual damascene method without using the plug <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a technique for improving surface flatness of an interlayer insulating film over a first metal interconnection formed by the OMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to suppress a short circuit of a second metal interconnection over a first metal interconnection formed by the CMP method, thereby improving the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above described and other objects and novel features of the present invention will be apparent from the description herein and the drawings attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Among the aspects of the invention disclosed herein, representative ones will next be summarized simply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (1) In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor integrated circuit device which comprises a semiconductor device formed over a principal surface of a semiconductor substrate; a first insulating film which is formed over the semiconductor device and has a first conductive member, which has been formed by the CMP method, embedded in each of first concave portions formed in the first insulating film; and a second insulating film which is formed over the first insulating film and has a second conductive member, which has been formed by the CMP method, embedded in each of second concave portions formed in the second insulating film, the second insulating film including a fluid insulating film having self fluidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to such a semiconductor integrated circuit device, even if dishing (concave) appears in the first conductive member, which has been embedded in the first insulating film, as a result of polishing by the CMP method or the first insulating film has a scratch on its surface as a result of polishing by the CMP method, the surface is planarized because the second insulating film includes a fluid insulating film, and influence of the above dishing or scratch is not observed from the surface of the second insulating film, whereby a conductive member to be embedded in the second insulating film is formed evenly by the CMP method. In other words, if the fluid insulating film is formed, the second conductive member to be embedded in the second insulating film does not remain in the concave portion on the surface of the second insulating film, whereby a short circuit between two adjacent conductive members of the second insulating film, which otherwise occurs due to the residue, can be prevented. Consequently, the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When a concave portion exists on the surface of the second insulating film, it becomes necessary to excessively polish a portion of the second insulating film for the formation of the second conductive member. In the present invention, since such a concave portion is not formed on the surface of the second insulating film, excessive polishing is not required. As a result, a short circuit can be avoided by preventing dishing of the second conductive member embedded in the second insulating film and evenly forming the conductive member to be overlaid for reasons similar to the above described ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, it is possible to form the first or second insulating film as an interconnection-forming insulating film which has an interconnection formed in its concave portion or an interconnection interlayer insulating film which insulates between interconnection films; to form the concave portion as an interconnection groove formed in the interconnection-forming insulating film or a connecting groove formed in the interconnection interlayer insulating film; and to form a conductive member as an interconnection formed in the interconnection groove or a plug formed in the connecting hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is possible to form the fluid insulating film to be included only in the interconnection interlayer insulating film positioned on the interconnection formed in the interconnection groove of the interconnection-forming insulating film; to be contained only in the interconnection-forming insulating film positioned on the plug formed in the connecting hole of the interconnection interlayer insulating film; or to be contained in both the interconnection interlayer insulating film positioned on the interconnection formed in the interconnection groove of the interconnection-forming insulating film and the interconnection-forming insulating film positioned on the plug formed in the connecting hole of the interconnection interlayer insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The concave portion may be made of an interconnection groove formed in the vicinity of the surfaces of the first and second insulating films and a connecting hole formed below the interconnection groove, and in the conductive member, an interconnection portion formed in the interconnection groove may be integrally formed with a connecting portion formed in the connecting hole. In other the present invention can also be applied to an interconnection (interconnection by the so-called dual damascene method) wherein a connecting hole portion and an interconnection groove portion have been integrally formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The second insulating film, interconnection interlayer insulating film and interconnection-forming insulating film each containing a fluid insulating film may have a three-layer structure of a non-fluid insulating film having no self fluidity, a fluid insulating film and a non-fluid insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the fluid insulating film, an SOG film can be used. Examples of the SOG film include organic SOG films, inorganic SOG films and polysilazane SOG films. Among them, inorganic SOG films are particularly preferred. If an organic SOG film is used as the fluid insulating film, the shrinkage or heightening of water absorption of the organic SOG film occurs upon processing of the second insulating film, interconnection interlayer insulating film or interconnection-forming insulating film which contains the organic SOG film by photolithography and by removing the photoresist film, that is, a mask for photolithography by oxygen ashing, which adversely affects the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. The use of the inorganic SOG film as a fluid insulating film, however, does not cause such an inconvenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As the fluid insulating film, it is possible to use a silicon oxide film prepared by forming a silanol in a gaseous phase and then reacting the resulting silanol on a low-temperature substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The SOG film is formed by application in an air atmosphere. A silicon oxide film formed by silanol formation in a gaseous phase and the reaction of the silanol on the low-temperature substrate, more specifically, formed by allowing silanol (H<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>Si(OH)<highlight><subscript>4-n</subscript></highlight>), which has been prepared by the combination of a silane gas (SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) under reduced pressure, to absorb to the surface of a substrate to form a film, can also be given as an example of the fluid insulating film. Here, a silane gas is exemplified as a raw material gas for the formation of a silanol, but methylsilane (dimethylsilane, trimethylsilane or the like) or ethylsilane (diethylsilane, triethylsilane or the like) having, as a substituent for a hydrogen group (&mdash;H), an alkyl group such as methyl (&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) or ethyl (&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The width W of each of the concave portion, interconnection groove and connecting hole may fall within a range of from its minimum width Wmix to the maximum width Wmx and satisfy the condition of Wmax&lE;4&times;Wmin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (2) In another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a semiconductor integrated circuit device which comprises a semiconductor device formed on a principal surface of a semiconductor substrate; a first insulating film which is formed over the semiconductor device and has a first conductive member, which has been formed by the CMP method, embedded in each of first concave portion formed in the first insulating film; and a second insulating film which is formed over the first insulating film and has a second conductive member, which has been formed by the CMP method, embedded in each of second concave portions formed in the second insulating film, the second insulating film including an insulating film planarized by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to such a semiconductor integrated circuit device, the second insulating film is able to have a planarized surface owing to the insulating film planarized by the CMP method as described above in (1) and the second conductive member to be embedded in the second insulating film is therefore formed securely, whereby occurrence of a short circuit can be prevented. By preventing excessive polishing of the second conductive member embedded in the second insulating film, thereby overlaying another conductive member securely, occurrence of a short circuit can be prevented, which, similar to (1), makes it possible to improve the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit devices as described above in (1) and (2) each may have, over the interconnection formed in its concave portion or interconnection groove, a diffusion preventive film for preventing the diffusion of metal elements which constitute the interconnection, for example, a silicon nitride film formed by the plasma CVD method. The existence of such a diffusion preventive film makes it possible to secure the withstand voltage of the interconnection interlayer insulating film, thereby improving the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (3) In a further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a process for the fabrication of a semiconductor integrated circuit device which comprises a semiconductor device formed on the principal surface of a semiconductor substrate, a first insulating film which has been formed over the semiconductor device and has a first conductive member embedded in one portion of the first insulating film and a second insulating film which has been formed over the first insulating film and has a second conductive member embedded in one portion of the second insulating film. It comprises (a) depositing the first insulating film over the semiconductor substrate having at least the semiconductor device formed thereon and forming first concave portions in the first insulating film; (b) forming, on the surface of the first insulating film including the inside surface of the first concave portions, a first conductive film to be embedded in the first concave portions, (c) polishing the first conductive film by the CMP method to leave only a portion of the first conductive film inside of each of the first concave portions of the first insulating film, thereby forming the first conductive member, (d) depositing over the first conductive member a fluid insulating film having self fluidity and (e) forming second concave portions in the second insulating film including the fluid insulating film, forming a second conductive film to be embedded in each of the second concave portions and then polishing the second conductive film by the CMP method, thereby forming the second conductive member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to the above process, the semiconductor integrated circuit device as described above in (1) can be fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, when the fluid insulating film is an SOC film, the SOC film is applied onto the semiconductor substrate, followed by thermal treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When the fluid insulating film is a silicon oxide film formed by the formation of a silanol in a gaseous phase and reaction of the resulting silanol on a low-temperature substrate, it can be formed by retaining the semiconductor substrate at a low temperature not higher than 100&deg; C. in a reaction chamber under reduced pressure, introducing SiH<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>M<highlight><subscript>4-x </subscript></highlight>(wherein M represents a C<highlight><subscript>1-3 </subscript></highlight>alkyl group, 1&lE;x&lE;4) and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into the reaction chamber to prepare a silanol and then heat treating the semiconductor substrate having the silanol deposited thereon. In this case, the larger the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group (-M), the lower the vapor pressure becomes. The wall surface temperature of the reaction chamber can hence be heightened and the temperature of the semiconductor substrate can be reduced to the minimum, which makes it possible to accelerate the adsorption of an alkylsilane (SiH<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>M<highlight><subscript>4-x</subscript></highlight>) on the semiconductor substrate maintained at low temperature, thereby increasing the possibility of the silanol formation reaction occurring in the vicinity of the surface of the semiconductor substrate. As a result, the yield of the raw material gas can be increased. Incidentally, the raw material gas is preferably supplied in a gaseous phase so that alkyl groups having not more than 3 carbon atoms are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The width W of each of the first concave portions which will have the first conductive member formed therein can be formed so that the maximum width Wmax is within a range of four times as much as the minimum width Wmin (Wmin&lE;W&lE;4&times;Wmin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the conductive film embedded in each of the first concave portions of the first insulating film in the above step (b), its height H1 in the concave portion of the minimum width Wmin may be almost equal to the height <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the concave portion of the maximum width Wmax (H1&cong;H2) and the heights H1 and H2 can be made higher than the height L1 of the surface of the first insulating film (H1&cong;H2&gt;L2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to such a process for the fabrication of a semiconductor integrated circuit device, the first conductive member formed in the step (b) is embedded in all of the first concave portions of the first insulating film and the surface of the first conductive member itself is polished and planarized. In this point, the present invention differs from the technique described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 7-297183. In the known technique, the surface height of a conductive film is lower than that of an interconnection groove in a wider interconnection groove so that when the conductive film is covered with a film such as SOG, followed by polishing to form an interconnection in the interconnection groove, the SOG film remains in the concave portion on the interconnection surface. In the present invention, on the other hand, a fluid insulating film such as SOG is deposited subsequent to the polishing for the formation of a first conductive member and the invention process therefore differs from the above technique in the order of steps. In addition, as described above, a height H1 of the concave portion of the minimum width Wmin is substantially similar to a height H2 of the concave portion of the maximum width Wmax (H1&cong;H2) and, at the same time, the heights H1 and H2 are both higher than a height L1 of the first insulating film (H1&cong;H2&gt;L1) so that the invention process differs from the above technique in the formation step itself for forming the first conductive member (corresponding to the interconnection in the above technique). The semiconductor integrated circuit devices fabricated by these two different processes are inevitably different and in the semiconductor integrated circuit device fabricated according to the present invention, a fluid insulating film such as SOG does not remain even if a concave portion (dishing) is formed on the first conductive member by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the first conductive member polished in the above step (c), the dishing amount K1 on the surface of the first conductive member in the concave portion of the minimum width Wmin and the dishing amount K2 on the surface of the first conductive member in the concave portion of the maximum width Wmax are substantially the same (K1&cong;K2). Such a fabrication process of a semiconductor integrated circuit device is available based on the above-described condition of H1&cong;H2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form a second insulating film by depositing a CVD silicon oxide film by the plasma CVD method or thermal CVD method prior to the deposition of the fluid insulating film, depositing the fluid insulating film and then depositing thereover a CVD oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the formation of the first conductive member, a diffusion preventive film, for example, a silicon nitride film, which covers the surface of the first conductive member can be deposited thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> By such a fabrication process, it is possible to prevent the diffusion of a metal element such as copper which constitutes the first conductive member, thereby improving the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> (4) In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a process for the fabrication of a semiconductor integrated circuit device which has a semiconductor device formed on the principal surface of a semiconductor substrate, a first insulating film which has been formed over the semiconductor device and has a first conductive member partially embedded therein and a second insulating film which has been formed over the first insulating film and has a second conductive member partially embedded therein; which comprises (a) depositing the first insulating film on the semiconductor substrate having at least the semiconductor device formed thereon and forming first concave portions in one portion of the first insulating film; (b) forming over the surface of the first insulating film including the inside surface of each of the first concave portions a first conductive film to be embedded in each of the first concave portions; (c) polishing the first conductive film by the CMP method to leave a portion of the first conductive film inside of each of the first concave portions of the first insulating film, thereby forming the first conductive member; (d) depositing a silicon oxide film over the first conductive member and polishing the silicon oxide film by the CMP method for planarization; and (e) forming second concave portions in the second insulating film including the silicon oxide film, forming a conductive film to be embedded in each of the second concave portions and polishing the conductive film by the CMP method, thereby forming a second conductive member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described fabrication process, a semiconductor integrated circuit device as described above in (2) can be fabricated. Incidentally, the silicon oxide film included in the second insulating film is planarized by the CMP method so that it is not required to have self fluidity and may be a silicon oxide film formed by the plasma CVD method or the CVD method using TEOS (tetramethoxysilane) or the like.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Incidentally, in all the drawings for illustrating the various embodiments, like members will be identified by like reference numerals and overlapping descriptions will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating one example of the semiconductor integrated circuit device according to one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit device according to the first embodiment has an n-channel MISFET (Metal Insulator Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) formed over a p-well <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having an SOI (Silicon On Insulator) insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an U-groove element isolation region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The 501 insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and U-groove element isolation region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are each formed, for example, from a silicon oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The n-channel MISFETQn has a gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed over the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and impurity semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed on both sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the side surfaces and upper surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, side wall spacers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a cap insulating film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made of a silicon oxide film having a thickness of several nm and can be formed, for example, by the CVD method or thermal oxidation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is made of a low-resistance polycrystalline silicon film or the like. The resistance of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be reduced by forming thereover a metal layer such as silicide or tungsten layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The impurity semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> function as source and drain regions of the n-channel MISFETQn and each has an n-type impurity such as phosphorus (P) or arsenic (As) introduced at a high concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Over the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and impurity semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a silicide film, for example, a high-melting-point metal silicide film such as Wsi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, MoSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, TiSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, and TaSi<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>may be stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As each of the side wall spacers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film can be used. When the silicon nitride film is used, a connecting hole, which will be described later, can be opened in an interlayer insulating film in self alignment by using the side wall spacers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> An interlayer insulating film ha is laid over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and n-channel MISFETQn. As the interlayer insulating film ha, a reflow film such as BPSG (Boron-doped Phospho-Silicate Glass) film or PSC (PhosphoSilicate Glass) can be used. Alternatively, the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be used as a laminate film having thereover or therebelow a silicon oxide film formed by the CVD or sputtering method. After deposition, the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is polished by the CMP method or the like so that it has a planarized surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>over the impurity semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a connecting hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed, in which a tungsten film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed for example by the sputtering method and a metal plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made of tungsten formed by the blanket CVD method, selective CVD method or the like have been formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Over the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(first interlayer insulating film) is formed and an interconnection (wiring line) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed in an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is made of a silicon oxide film formed for example by the CVD method or sputtering method. Incidentally, on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a scratch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is likely to be formed. This scratch is made by a polishing agent for CMP and, as will be described later, the presence of the scratch is due to over polishing to some extent to completely remove the metal film on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>upon polishing by the CMP method for the formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of a main conductive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The main conductive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is for example made of copper, but may be made of aluminum or tungsten, or an alloy thereof. By forming the main conductive layer from such a material having a low resistance, an increase in the interconnection resistance attributable to the miniaturization of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be suppressed, whereby the performance of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be heightened. The titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be allowed to act as a blocking film for preventing the diffusion of a material which constitutes the main conductive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example, copper. As well as the titanium nitride (TiN) film, tantalum (Ta) film, tantalum nitride (TaN) film, tungsten nitride (WN) film or sputter tungsten film, or a compound thereof with silicon (Si) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> On the upper surface of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a dishing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(concave) is formed. As will be described subsequently, such dishing appears owing to the difference in a CMP rate between the metal material constituting the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film constituting the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>upon formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by the CMP method. In other words, the CMP rate of the metal is larger than that of the silicon oxide film so that when over etching is carried out to some extent for forming the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> securely, the metal is polished faster than the silicon oxide film and a relatively concave surface is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Over the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed. The interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of a blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in contact with the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and an insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As the blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a silicon nitride (SiN) film formed for example by the plasma CVD method can be used. It has a function of suppressing the diffusion of copper which constitutes the main conductive film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Together with the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also effective for preventing the diffusion of copper into the interlayer insulating films <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby maintaining their insulation properties and heightening the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Incidentally, when the silicon nitride film is employed, the blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be formed to a thickness of about 100 nm. </paragraph>

The existence of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible to secure the surface flatness of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and; as will described later, to prevent the formation of a residue of the metal film upon formation of a second-layer interconnection which is to be embedded in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the occurrence of a short circuit of the second-layer interconnection, whereby the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As the insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) film formed, for example, by the CVD method can be used.

It is not essential when a sufficient film thickness of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be maintained by the planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed and an interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed inside of each of the interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as a second metal interconnection. Some of the interconnection grooves include a connecting hole for connecting with the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed below the groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Described specifically, a connecting interconnection and interconnection are integrally formed by the so-called dual damascene method in which the interconnection groove and connecting hole are formed, a metal film is deposited on the substrate including the interconnection groove and connecting hole and a portion of the metal film outside the interconnection groove is removed for example by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Similar to the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made of a main conductive film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As the main conductive film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, copper can be exemplified but aluminum or tungsten, or an alloy thereof-may be employed. By using such a low resistance material for the main conductive layer, an increase in the interconnection resistance attendant on the miniaturization of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be suppressed, whereby the performance of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be heightened.

As well as the titanium nitride film, a tantalum film, tantalum nitride film, tungsten nitride film or sputter tungsten film or a compound thereof with silicon can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed, as will be described later, by removing the metal film formed over the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the CMP method. The flatness of the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is maintained as described above so that there exists no concave portion on the surface but the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and no metal film remains except the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which makes it possible to prevent the occurrence of a short circuit of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> attributable to metal residue, thereby improving the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Furthermore, the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is so flat that over polishing is not necessary in the CMP for the formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Consequently, a short circuit of the upper interconnection in the case where a further interconnection (third metal interconnection and the like) is formed by suppressing the dishing of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be prevented, whereby the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of p<highlight><superscript>- </superscript></highlight> type single crystal silicon, the substrate having an SOI insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by a high-concentration oxygen injection method or the like, is prepared and an impurity, such as boron, for attaining p-conductivity type is doped by ion implantation or the like, whereby a p-well <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed. Alternatively, the p-well may be formed by mixing an impurity gas and thereby doping at the time of epitaxial growth by the high-concentration oxygen injection method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Next, on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a U groove reaching the SOI insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed, followed by deposition of a silicon oxide film or the like. The U groove is filled with the silicon oxide film, while the unnecessary portion of the silicon oxide film is removed by the CMP method or the like, whereby a U-groove element isolation region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Then, over the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film which will be a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a polycrystalline silicon film which will be a gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film which will be a cap insulating film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are successively deposited to form a laminate film. The laminate film is etched with a resist, which has been patterned by photolithography, as a mask, whereby the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be deposited for example by the thermal CVD method and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be formed by the CVD method. In order to reduce its resistance, an n-type impurity (ex. P) may be doped.

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> After deposition of a silicon oxide film over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the CVD method, the silicon oxide film is subjected to anisotropic etching by the reactive ion etching (RIE) method, whereby side wall spacers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are formed on the side walls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, n-type impurity (phosphorus) is ion-implanted, whereby impurity semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having source and drain regions of n-channel MISFETQn in the p wells on both sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Incidentally, prior to the formation of the side wall spacers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a low-concentration impurity semiconductor region may be formed, followed by the formation of a high-concentration impurity semiconductor region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> After a silicon oxide film is deposited over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the sputtering or CVD method, the silicon oxide film is polished for example by the CMP method, whereby an interlayer insulating film ha having a planarized surface is formed.

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> A silicon oxide film is then deposited by the sputtering or CVD method, whereby an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed. The interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is processed by photolithography or etching technique, whereby an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Here, a silicon oxide film formed by the sputtering or CVD method is exemplified as the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, but any one of a coated film such as SOG, organic film, fluorine-added CVD silicon oxide film, silicon nitride film and multi-layer film having thereon plural kinds of insulating films stacked one after another can be exemplified. The interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in a region where an interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is desired to be formed subsequently by embedding an interconnection material. In this embodiment 1, the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed subsequent to the formation of the metal plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, but it is also possible to form the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> after opening of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then forming the metal plug <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> All over the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which will be a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deposited (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be deposited, for example, by the CVD or sputtering method. It is deposited in order to improve the adhesion of a copper film, which will be described later, and to prevent the diffusion of copper. In this embodiment 1, a titanium nitride film is given as an example, but a metal film of tantalum or tantalum nitride film can be used. Just before carrying out the next step, that is, deposition of a main conductive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the surface of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be subjected to sputter etching. Such sputter etching makes it possible to remove water, oxygen molecule or the like adsorbed on the surface of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby improving the adhesion of the main conductive film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Its effect is large particularly when the main conductive film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited over the surface of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which has been exposed to the air by vacuum break. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Over the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a metal film which will be a main conductive film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example, a thin copper film is deposited, followed by thermal treatment for fluidization, whereby a metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> embedded favorably in the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). For the deposition of the copper film, the conventional sputtering method can be used, but it can be replaced by the physical vapor deposition method. The thermal treatment is conducted under the conditions of temperature and time sufficient for fluidizing copper which constitutes the metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, for example, 350 to 400&deg; C. for 3 to 5 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The unnecessary portions of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are then removed, whereby a main conductive film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are the components of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Removal of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the metal film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is carried out by polishing through the CMP method. Since the CMP method is employed for the formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a dishing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, that is, a concave state compared with the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is formed on the surface of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, while a scratch hic is formed on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by a polishing agent used in the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> A silicon nitride film is deposited over the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to form a blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). For the deposition of the silicon nitride film, a plasma CVD method can be used by way of example. It is formed to a film thickness of about 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> An SOG film having self fluidity is applied to the blocking film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, followed by thermal treatment at 400&deg; C. or the like for curing the film, whereby a planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which has a planarized surface is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). As the SOG film, an organic or inorganic SOG film can be used. Alternatively, a polysilazane SOG film can be used. The polysilazane SOG film has heat resistance so that the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved by the use of it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> An insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is then deposited over the planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereby the formation of an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is completed. A silicon oxide film formed for example by the CVD method can be used as the insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, that is, the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is kept flat owing to the existence of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are then formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Some of the interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> include connecting holes for the connection with the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which exists below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the interconnection <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which will be a part of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited. A metal film which will be a main conductive film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for example, a thin copper film is then deposited over the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, followed by thermal treatment for fluidization, whereby a metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> favorably embedded in the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). The titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be formed in a similar manner to that employed for the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and metal film <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that the description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In the final step, the unnecessary portions of the metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are removed to form an interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, whereby a semiconductor integrated circuit device as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is substantially completed. For the removal of the metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the CMP method is employed. In this embodiment, since the surface flatness of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is maintained and an undesired concave portion therefore does not exist on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> even by the formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the CMP method so that neither the metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> nor the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>remains undesirably. As a result, the occurrence of the short circuit of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> attributable to such a residue can be prevented and the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the flatness of the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is maintained, it is possible to form the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> securely even without over etching by CMP, whereby over etching can be prevented. Accordingly, the formation of a dishing on the surface of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is suppressed, whereby a short circuit of the interconnection to be formed thereover is prevented and the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment 1, an SOG film was exemplified as the planarizing film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Then, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is polished by the CMP method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) to remove the concave portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed on the surface of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, whereby a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed and the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a flat surface is formed. In the process according to the second embodiment, the use of the CMP method makes it possible to remove the concave portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and in addition, to improve the whole flatness of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Then, similar to the first embodiment, an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>), followed by the formation of a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which will be a main conductive film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed as in the first embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In the final step, the metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are removed to form an interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, whereby a semiconductor integrated circuit device as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is substantially completed. For the removal of the metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the CMP method is employed as in the first embodiment 1. Since the surface flatness of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is maintained in this embodiment, neither metal film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> nor titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>undesirably remains on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> even by the CMP method for the formation of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, the occurrence of a short circuit of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> due to such a residue can be prevented and the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the flatness of the surface of the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is maintained, it is possible to form the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> securely even without over etching by CMP, whereby over etching can be prevented. Accordingly, the formation of a dishing on the surface of the interconnection <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is suppressed to prevent a short circuit of the interconnection to be formed thereover and the yield and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating one example of a semiconductor integrated circuit device according to a further aspect of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit device according to the third embodiment has an n-channel MISFETQn and p-channel MISFETQp formed over a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor devices n-channel MISFETQn and p-channel MISFETQp constitute CMISFET (Complementary-MISFET), thereby constituting a semiconductor integrated circuit device, in which passive elements such as resistor and capacitor can be included, though not illustrated. Although CMISFET is exemplified in this embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit device can be formed of a single channel MISFET, that is, n-channel MISFETQn or p-channel MISFETQp. Furthermore, although a MISFET is exemplified in this embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit device can be formed of a semiconductor device having a transistor structure such as bipolar transistor or Bi-CMISFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In the vicinity of the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, element isolation regions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are formed and in the active region surrounded by the element isolation regions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a p-type well <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having a p-type impurity (ex. boron (B)) introduced therein at a low concentration and an n-type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having an n-type impurity (ex. phosphorus (P), arsenic (As)) introduced therein at a low concentration are formed. The n-channel MISFETQn is formed on the principal surface of the active region of the n-type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, while the p-channel MISFETQp is formed on the principal surface of the active region of the n-type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The element isolation regions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are each formed in a shallow groove on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and it is made of a silicon oxide film or the like. Incidentally, it is needless to say that the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be an SOI substrate as described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The n-channel MISFETQn has a gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> formed on the principal surface of the p-type well <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> formed on both sides of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The p-channel MISFETQp has another gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> formed on the principal surface of the n-type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through another gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and p-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> formed on both side of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is made of a silicon oxide film which has a thickness of several nm and can be formed, for example, by the thermal oxidation method or thermal CVD method. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is, for example, made of a low-resistance polycrystalline silicon film, over which, with a view to decreasing the resistance, a silicide film such as tungsten (W) silicide or cobalt (Co) silicide may be stacked or a metal film such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti) or tantalum (Ta) is formed with a barrier metal such as titanium nitride (TiN) or tungsten nitride (WN) being disposed between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the metal film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> function as a source drain region of the n-channel MISFETQn and p-channel MISFETQp, respectively. Into the semiconductor region <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, an n-type impurity (ex. phosphorus or arsenic) is introduced, while into the semiconductor region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a p-type impurity (ex. boron) is introduced. The semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be formed to have a so-called LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure which is made of a low-concentration semiconductor region having an impurity introduced therein at a low concentration and a high-concentration semiconductor region having an impurity introduced therein at a high concentration. Over the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a high-melting-point metal silicide film such as Wsi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, MOSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, TiSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, and TaSi<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> On the side walls and upper surface of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, side wall spacers <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and a cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed, respectively. As the side wall spacers <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film or the like can be used. When a silicon nitride film is used, a connecting hole can be opened, as will be described later, in a interlayer insulating film in self alignment by using the side wall spacers <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, each made of a silicon nitride film, as masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, n-channel MISFETQn and p-channel MISFETQp, an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is formed. As the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, a reflow film such as BPSG film or PSG film can be used. Alternatively, the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be formed as a laminate film with a silicon oxide film formed below or over the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> by the CVD or sputtering method. The interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has a surface planarized, for example, by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> over the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a connecting hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is disposed. In the connecting hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, formed is a plug <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> which is made of a tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed, for example, by the sputtering method and a tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed, for example, by the blanket CVD or selective CVD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Over the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, a first-layer interconnection M1 is formed. As the first-layer interconnection M1, for example, a tungsten film patterned by photolithography can be used. The first-layer interconnection M1 is electrically connected with the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through the plug <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, since tungsten is used as a material for the first-layer interconnection M1, the element which constitutes the first-layer interconnection M1 does not diffuse into the semiconductor substrate, whereby a highly reliable semiconductor integrated circuit device can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Over the first-layer interconnection M1 and interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, formed is an interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for insulating between the first-layer interconnection M1 and the second-layer interconnection M2 which will be described later. As the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film which has been formed for example by the CVD method and has a surface planarized by the CMP method can be used, In the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed. The connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed to have therein a plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> made of a tungsten film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed for example by the sputtering method and a tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed for example by the blanket CVD or selective CVD method. Instead of the tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a titanium nitride film formed by the sputtering or CVD method can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Over the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, an interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> for the formation of the second-layer interconnection M2 is formed. As the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film formed for example by the CVD method can be used. Incidentally, scratches are formed on the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, but they are not illustrated. These scratches are made by a polishing agent of CMP and these scratches occur, as will be described later, due to over etching to some extent to remove the metal film on the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> completely upon the formation of the second-layer interconnection M2 by the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed. The interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has the second-layer interconnection M2 formed therein. The second-layer interconnection M2 is made of a barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for example made of titanium nitride (TiN) and a main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for example made of copper (Cu). Since a low resistance material such as copper is used as the main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the resistance of the second-layer interconnection M2 can be reduced, interconnection resistance between the semiconductor devices can be reduced to shorten the delay time of the circuit and a response rate of the semiconductor integrated circuit device can be improved, leading to the improvement in the performance of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> As the barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, tantalum (Ta), tungsten nitride (WN), tantalum nitride (TaN), tantalum oxide (TaO) or silicon oxide nitride (SiON) can be used instead of titanium nitride. For the main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, aluminum (Al) or tungsten (W) can be used instead of copper The barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a function of preventing the diffusion of a metal element which constitutes the main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, securing the insulation property between interconnections and maintaining the performance and reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device at high levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The second-layer interconnection M2 is, as will be described later, formed by the CMP method. It has on its surface a concave portion (dishing portion) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which has been formed owing to a difference in the polishing rate by the CMP method between a material (ex. silicon oxide film) constituting the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and a material (ex. copper and titanium nitride) constituting the second-layer interconnection M2. If over polishing is carried out to some extent in order to form the second-layer interconnection M2 securely, copper is polished faster than the silicon oxide film, which inevitably forms a relatively concave surface. The existence of such a concave portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and problems attributable to it are as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> On the surfaces of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and second-layer interconnection M2, the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is formed. The interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is made of a blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in contact with the second-layer interconnection M2 and interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and an insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> As the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a silicon nitride film formed, for example, by the plasma CVD method can be used. It has a function of suppressing the diffusion of copper which constitutes the main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second-layer interconnection M2. Together with the barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> made of titanium nitride, the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>exhibits effects for preventing the diffusion of copper and maintaining the insulation property of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the like, thereby heightening the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Incidentally, when a silicon nitride film is used, the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be formed to a thickness of about 100 rim. As the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a silicon oxide nitride film can be used instead of a silicon nitride film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a film having self fluidity, for example, an SOG film and is able to planarize its surface by removing the influence of the concave portion <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The existence of such a planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible to secure the flatness of the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the formation of the residue of a metal film upon the formation of a plug or upper interconnection to be embedded in the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> as will be described later and preventing the occurrence of a short circuit between the upper interconnections. The semiconductor integrated circuit therefore maintain its predetermined performance and is able to have improved yield and reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> An inorganic SOG film can be used as the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The use of the inorganic SOG film makes it possible to improve the reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device without imparting the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with water absorption or causing a volumetric decrease of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>upon peeling of a photoresist film in the opening step of a connecting hole in the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which will be described later. Alternatively, an organic SOG film can be used as the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Although the use of the organic SOG film causes the above-described inconveniences in the opening step of the connecting hole, the film makes it possible to reduce a line capacity between interconnections by making use of its low dielectric constant and to raise the speed of the semiconductor integrated circuit device, thereby improving its performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> As the insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a silicon oxide film formed for example by the CVD method can be used and it has a function of securing the thickness of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is therefore not essential when the sufficient film thickness of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can-be secured by the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is able to have a silicon oxide film formed between the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the CVD method. </paragraph>

Over the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and plug <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, an interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and third-layer interconnection M3 similar to the above-described interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and second-layer interconnection M2 are formed. The plug <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and third-layer interconnection M3 are similar to the above-described plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and second-layer interconnection M2 so that a detailed description thereof will be omitted. The third-layer interconnection M3 is, similar to the second-layer interconnection M2, made of a barrier film and a main copper-made conductive film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Although the third-layer interconnection M3 has a concave portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> on its surface similar to the second-layer interconnection M2, the unevenness attributable to the concave portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> on the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is leveled owing to the existence of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which constitutes the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which makes it possible to prevent the formation of the residue of a metal film upon formation of an upper plug or upper interconnection, thereby preventing the occurrence of a short circuit between upper interconnections.

Similar to the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is able to have a silicon oxide film formed between the blocking film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the planarizing film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the CVD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> A connecting hole <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed in the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and a plug <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> made of tungsten similar to the plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed in the connecting hole <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The plug <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has however a diameter and height larger than those of the plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> because the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Over the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and plug <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, a fifth-layer interconnection M5 is formed. The fifth-layer interconnection M5 is, for example, made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy and it is formed by photolithography and etching techniques. By electrically connecting, through a barrier film made of tungsten, the fifth-layer interconnection M5 made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy and the fourth-layer interconnection M4 having a main conductive film made of copper, an increase in the resistance caused by the reaction between aluminum and copper can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The fifth-layer interconnection M5 is covered with an insulating film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. As the insulating film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film formed for example by the CVD method or a laminate film thereof can be used. The insulating film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may include a protective film such as PIQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> An opening is formed partially in the insulating film <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. A bump <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the fifth-layer interconnection M5 are electrically, connected through a bump lower metal (BLM) <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> formed in the opening. As the bump lower metal <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, a laminate film of nickel and gold can be used, while as the bump <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, gold or solder can be used. Incidentally, copper can be used as a material for the fifth-layer interconnection M5, but the use of aluminum improves the alignment with the bump lower metal <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the bump <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> When a bonding pad for wire bonding is formed on the fifth-layer interconnection M5 in place of the bump <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, an improvement in the reliability can be brought about by forming the bonding pad from an aluminum alloy which is more oxidation resistant than copper. In the upper interconnection such as fifth-layer interconnection M5, the interconnection rule such as a pitch between interconnections can be made looser than that of the second to fourth-layer interconnections M2 to M4 so that the reliability can be improved by constituting the upper interconnection from an aluminum alloy which is freer than copper from the problems such as oxidation. In the second to fourth-layer interconnections M2 to M4, on the other hand, interconnections can be disposed at high density by decreasing the interconnection width and interconnection pitch and at the same time, the acting speed of the circuit can be improved by using as a main conductive film copper which has a smaller specific resistance than aluminum, thereby decreasing the interconnection resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The thickness and width of each of the first-layer interconnection M1 to the fifth-layer interconnection M5 and the diameter and height of each of the plugs <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are exemplified below. For example, the first-layer interconnection M1 can be formed to a thickness of 0.2 to 0.3 &mgr;m and a minimum width of 0.4 &mgr;m. The second and third-layer interconnections M2 and M3 can each be formed to a thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m and a minimum width of 0.5 &mgr;m. The fourth-layer interconnection M4 can be formed to a thickness of 1 &mgr;m and a minimum width of 1 &mgr;m. The plugs <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can each be formed to a diameter of 0.5 &mgr;m and a height of 1 &mgr;m, while the plug <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can be formed to a diameter of 1 &mgr;m and a height of 2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> A process for the fabrication of the above-described semiconductor integrated circuit device will next be described with reference to accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views illustrating one example of the fabrication process of the semiconductor integrated circuit device according to the third embodiment in the order of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> made of p<highlight><superscript>- </superscript></highlight> type single crystal silicon is prepared. A shallow groove is formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by patterning a photoresist film having an opening at a region where an element isolation region <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is to be formed. The photoresist film is then removed and a silicon oxide film to be embedded in the shallow groove is deposited all over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The silicon oxide film is polished by the CMP method, whereby a portion of the silicon oxide film on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> outside the shallow groove is removed and the element isolation region <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed in the shallow groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Next, a photoresist film having an opening at a region where a p-type well <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is to be formed is patterned. With the photoresist film as a mask, an impurity for forming a region of a p-conductivity type, for example, boron is ion-implanted. After removal of the photoresist film, a photoresist film having an opening at a region where an n-type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is to be formed is patterned. With the photoresist film as a mask, an impurity for forming a region of an n-conductivity type, for example, phosphorus is ion implanted. The photoresist mask is removed. The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is then thermally treated to activate the above-described impurities, whereby the p type well <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the n type well <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Over the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film which will be a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a polycrystalline silicon film which will be a gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film which will be a cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are deposited successively to form a laminate film. With a photoresist film patterned by photolithography as a mask, the laminate film is etched, whereby the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be deposited, for example, by the thermal CVD method. Although the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be formed by the CVD method, an n type impurity (ex. P) may be doped in order to reduce its resistance. Incidentally, it is also possible to stack over the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> a high-melting point metal silicide film such as Wsi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, MoSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, TiSi<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>or TaSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, a metal film such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti) or tantalum (Ta) may be formed with a barrier film such as titanium nitride (TiN) or tungsten nitride (WN) being disposed between the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the metal film. The cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be deposited for example by the CVD method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> A photoresist film having an opening at a region where n-channel MISFETQn is to be formed is then patterned. With the photoresist film and the cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as masks, an n-conductivity type impurity, for example, phosphorus is ion-planted, whereby a semiconductor region <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed in self alignment with the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. After the removal of the photoresist film, another photoresist film having an opening at a region where p-channel MISFETQp is to be formed is patterned. With the photoresist film and cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as masks, a p-conductivity type impurity, for example, boron is ion-implanted, whereby the semiconductor region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed in self alignment with the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film is then deposited by the CVD method. The silicon oxide film is subjected to anisotropic etching by the reactive ion etching (RIE) method, whereby side wall spacers <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are formed on the side walls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). Incidentally, it is also possible to ion-implant, to the semiconductor region <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> or semiconductor region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, an impurity corresponding to its conductivity type with the photoresist film, cap insulating film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and side wall spacers <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> being used as masks, thereby forming an impurity semiconductor region having a so-called LDD structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> At this stage, it is also possible to form a tungsten silicide or cobalt silicide film on the surface of the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thereby decreasing the sheet resistance of each of the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the contact resistance with the plug <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film is then deposited by the sputtering or CVD method to form an-interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is able to have a surface planarized by polishing through the CMP method. In the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the principal surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, connecting holes <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are opened by photolithography and etching techniques (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Then, a tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited by the sputtering method, followed by the deposition of a tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the blanket CVD method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Portions of the tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a region over the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> outside the connecting hole are removed by polishing through the CMP method to form a plug <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>). At this time, on the surface of the plug <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a concave portion (dishing portion) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> attributable to a difference in the CMP rate among a silicon oxide film as the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and tungsten film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed. The etch back method can be used instead of the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> A tungsten film is then deposited all over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The film is patterned by photolithography and etching techniques, whereby a first-layer interconnection M1 is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>). The concave portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which has appeared in the previous step has an influence on the surface of the tungsten film, but the uneven surface of the tungsten film owing to this concave portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> does not exert a large influence on the first-layer interconnection M1 because it is formed by patterning. In short, the first-layer interconnection M1 does not remain owing to the existence of the concave portion <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> A silicon oxide film is deposited by the sputtering or CVD method, whereby an interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is formed. Here, the silicon oxide film formed by the sputtering or CVD method is exemplified above, but a coated film such as SOG. an organic film, a fluorine-added CVD silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film or a multi-layer film having plural kinds of insulating films stacked one after another may be used instead. The surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is planarized by the CMP method. Such planarization makes it possible to carry out photolithography with good precision upon processing of a connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, and to easily meet the integration heightening tendency of a semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> which reaches the surface of the first interconnection M1 is opened by photolithography and etching techniques (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> On the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> including the inside surface of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, a tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited by the sputtering method, followed by deposition of a tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the blanket CVD method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The portions of the tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> outside the connecting hole <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are removed by the CMP method, whereby a plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>). At this time, a concave portion <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> attributable to a difference in the CMP rate among the silicon oxide film as the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and tungsten film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on the surface of the plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Here, the etch back method may be used instead of the CMP method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> An interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> for the formation of a second-layer interconnection M2 by the CMP method is then deposited (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>). As the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film formed by the CVD or sputtering method can be exemplified. It is formed to a film thickness of 0.5 &mgr;m, which is the thickness of the second-layer interconnection M2, or a little thicker. On the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, a concave portion influenced by the concave portion <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> A photoresist film having an opening at a region where the second-layer interconnection M2 is to be formed is formed and with this photoresist film as a mask, the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is etched, whereby an interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed in the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>). At this stage, the above-described concave portion on the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, said concave portion having been formed, influenced by the concave portion <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, is removed so that it has no influence on the subsequent steps. The width of the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed to fall within a range from the minimum width W1 to the maximum width W2 provided that the maximum width W2 is not greater than four times as much as the minimum width W1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Then, a titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which will be a barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited over the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> including the inside surface of the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>). The titanium oxide film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can be deposited for example by the CVD or sputtering method. The deposition of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is carried out in order to improve the adhesion with a copper film, which will be described later, and to prevent the diffusion of copper. Instead of the titanium nitride film, a metal film such as tantalum or a tantalum nitride film may be used. It is also possible to carry out sputter etching of the surface of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> just before the subsequent copper-film deposition step. Such sputter etching permits the removal of water, oxygen molecules or the like adsorbed onto the surface of the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, thereby improving the adhesion of the copper film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> A metal film to be a main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, for example, a thin copper film is then deposited, followed by thermal treatment for fluidization, whereby a copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> favorably embedded in the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>). For the deposition of the copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, an ordinarily-employed sputtering method can be used. The physical vapor deposition method can also be used. Alternatively, deposition may be carried out by the CVD method using an organic metal gas or the like as a raw material gas. As the thermal treatment conditions, temperature and time sufficient for fluidizing the copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are required. For example, 350&deg; C. to 400&deg; C. for 3 to 5 minutes can be exemplified. The copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> can also be formed using the plating method such as electroplating or electroless plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, each has a thickness of H1 in the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the minimum width W1 and H2 in the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the maximum width W2. Here, the thickness H1 and H2 are substantially same and they are larger than the depth L1 of the interconnection groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In other words, the copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is completely embedded in each of the interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the minimum width W1 and the maximum width W2. This makes it possible to form the second interconnection M2 in almost all the interconnection grooves <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the resistance of the second-layer interconnection M2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Then, the unnecessary portions of the copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> over the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> are removed, whereby a main conductive film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a barrier film <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which constitute the second-layer interconnection M2 are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>). For the removal of the copper film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and the titanium nitride film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the CMP method is employed. Since the CMP method is used for the formation of the second-layer interconnection M2, a dishing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is a portion indented from the surface of the interconnection-forming insulting film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the second-layer interconnection M2. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the portion surrounded by a dashed line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37, a</cross-reference> scratch <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> made by the polishing agent in CMP appears on the surface of the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> A silicon nitride film is then deposited over the second-layer interconnection M2 and the interconnection-forming insulating film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to form a blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>). For the deposition of the silicon nitride film, the plasma CVD method or the like can be used. The film is formed to a thickness of about 100 nm. Owing to excellent step covering property of the silicon nitride film formed by the CVD method, there exists unevenness attributable to the dishing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and scratch <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> on the, surface of the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at this stage as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Then, the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is coated with an SOG film having self fluidity, followed by thermal treatment at about 400&deg; C. for curing, whereby a planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>). As the SOG film, an organic or inorganic SOG film can be used. A polysilazane SOG film can also be used. The polysilazane SOG film has heat resistance and is able to bring about an improvement in the reliability of a semiconductor integrated circuit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of a portion surrounded by a dashed line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, owing to the use of an SOG film having self fluidity as the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the surface is planarized and influences of the dishing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and scratch <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> An insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is then deposited, whereby an interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is completed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>). As the insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a silicon oxide film made for example by the CVD method can be used. The surface of the insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, that is, the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is kept flat by the existence of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereby a conductive residue attributable to the dishing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or scratch <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is not formed upon the formation of a conductive member such as a plug <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which will be formed in the subsequent step and an insulating property between upper third-layer interconnections M3 can be secured. The surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> has been planarized so that the margin of photolithography is improved, which makes it possible to meet the miniaturization tendency of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. </paragraph>

This etching is carried out under the condition that the etching rate of the silicon oxide film will become larger than that of the silicon nitride film. The blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>made of the silicon oxide film can be used as a stopper film in the etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Under the etching condition changed so that the etching rate of the silicon nitride film will become larger than that of the silicon oxide film, the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is etched, whereby the formation of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is completed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>). Such two-step etching of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> prevents excessive etching of the second-layer interconnection M2 even when over-etching is conducted sufficiently upon etching of the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, because the blocking film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is thin. As a result, the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be opened without failure and damage to the second-layer interconnection M2 can be reduced to the minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Upon removal of the photoresist film <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, an ashing method using oxygen or ozone is generally employed. When inorganic SOG is used for the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, damage to the cross-section of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the side surface portions of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be suppressed. Described specifically, if organic SOG is used for the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, an Si&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>bond in the organic SOG is converted to a Si&mdash;OH bond or Si&mdash;O bond upon ozone ashing, which heightens water absorption or causes film shrinkage of the converted portion, which is expected to bring about lowering of the reliability and yield of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. The use of the organic SOG is therefore not preferred. When the organic SOG is adopted, it becomes necessary to use a method which is not so familiar as compared with ashing, for example, peeling of the photoresist film <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> by wet process, reactive ion etching (RIE) using low-pressure oxygen plasma or the like. The use of inorganic SOG for the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, on the other hand, does not cause such inconvenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Just before the subsequent plug (<highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>) formation step, the surface of the second-layer interconnection M2 on the bottom of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be subjected to reduction treatment by annealing at 350&deg; C. for about 5 minutes in a hydrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, sputter etching can be given to the bottom of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. By such treatment, copper oxide which has appeared on the bottom of the connecting hole <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> as a result of ashing upon removal of the photoresist film <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> or allowing the connecting hole to stand in the atmospheric environment can be removed, whereby resistance of the electric connection between the second-layer interconnection M2 and plug <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> can be reduced or the connection reliability can be improved. </paragraph>

As described above, the CMP method is employed upon the formation of the plug <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. A conductive residue does not remain on the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> because the interconnection insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> has a planarized surface. Both the insulation property between plugs <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and that of the third-layer interconnections M3 formed on the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can be maintained.

This is because the above-described concave portion is etched and removed upon processing of a shallow groove for the formation of the third-layer interconnection M3, Incidentally, on the surface of the third-layer interconnection M3, a concave portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>S is formed as a result of the CMP method. </paragraph>

The formation of the planarizing film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible to remove the influence of the concave portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thereby planarizing the surface. </paragraph>

As described above, the CMP method is employed for the formation of the plug <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Since the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> has been planarized, no conductive residue remains on the surface of the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, whereby the insulating properties between the plugs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and those between the fourth-layer interconnections M4 formed over the interconnection interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be maintained. On the surface of the plug <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, a concave portion <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is formed as a result of the polishing by the CMP method. Similar to the case of the third-layer interconnection, the concave portion <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> does not induce the formation of a conductive residue in the subsequent step. </paragraph>
