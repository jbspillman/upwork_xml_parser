<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a content distribution system that distributes a multimedia content including videos and sounds from a distribution device to a reproduction device via a communication medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent year, with advances in data compression technology, a multimedia content stream including videos and sounds has been distributed via a communication medium such as a BS digital broadcasting network, Internet and a mobile communication network. In the BS digital broadcasting, for example, we can view and listen to a digital TV program and data broadcasting multiplexed on it. Also, in the world of the Internet, we can receive and enjoy a content stream including videos and sounds. It has been possible to distribute videos and sounds using a wideband communication network (W-CDMA) in the mobile communication network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Under the circumstances, there are prior arts concerning a transfer method of stream data, distribution of an enhanced content and sending and receiving of a video stream, such as Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H09-275553 &ldquo;Stream Data Transfer Method and Device&rdquo;, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H11-155134 &ldquo;Method and System for Providing Enhanced Content along with Broadcasting Video&rdquo;, and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H11-331810 &ldquo;Video Stream Sending and Receiving System&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is also a prior art concerning billing in this kind of stream distribution, such as Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H08-32530 &ldquo;Data Broadcasting and Data Receiving Device&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is a prior art concerning a video stream viewing technology, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,215. This is an application of a technology for three-dimensional computer graphics, which maps a plurality of video streams on rectangular planes of a polyhedron for viewing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, according to the above-mentioned prior arts concerning sending and receiving of stream data, a user can view and listen to only a rectangular video and a sound that a content creator creates, and cannot select a background video nor a foreground video in the content video. That is, all that a user can select freely is an entire content work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the above-mentioned prior art concerning billing, since only one pricing can be decided per content work, a user has no selection but to pay the fee reluctantly even if he/she is not satisfied with a background video or a foreground video unsuitable to his/her taste in the content. That is, according to this prior art, the billing is based on the data volume of the content, not on elements included in the content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the above-mentioned prior art concerning a video stream viewing technology, it is impossible to modify the elements of the video stream (an exchange of a background or a foreground, for example) because no consideration is given to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As a result, there is a problem that these prior arts do not give users full satisfaction in terms of the content itself, nor convince them fully in terms of the price of the content because their diversified tastes for videos, music and others are not reflected. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly the first object of the present invention, in the light of the above-mentioned problem, to provide a content distribution system that can offer a user not only a selection of a content work but also a wider selection of a content element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention provides a content distribution system and a distribution method that can offer a user not only a selection of a content work but also a selection of a content element such as a background video, a foreground video like a person and a non-living thing, or a sound, and further a selection of a layout of the elements to the user&apos;s taste, when the user views and listens to the content work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, differently from the prior art that charges a single price for a content work, the second object of the present invention is to provide a content distribution system, etc. including a billing system in which various prices can be charged corresponding to a material such as a background video, a foreground video and a sound which a user selects to his/her taste, and various prices can be decided corresponding to a person and a non-living thing which appear in the content so as to exercise the copyright and the portrait right of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the third object of the present invention is to provide a content distribution system, etc. in which a user can efficiently view a plurality of rectangular windows showing video streams on the same screen simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-mentioned first object, the content distribution system according to the present invention comprises a distribution device that distributes a content via a communication medium and a reproduction device for viewing and listening to the distributed content, wherein the reproduction device includes: a content selecting unit operable to accept from a user a selection of a content and a selection of a background video material and a foreground video material included in the content; a selection information sending unit operable to send information on the selection which is accepted by the content selecting unit to the distribution device; a content controlling unit operable to receive material data which is distributed from the distribution device and output the material data as video data; and a content displaying unit operable to display the video data which is outputted from the content controlling unit, and the distribution device includes a material data distributing unit operable to distribute corresponding material data to the reproduction device based on the information from the reproduction device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the selection information sending unit sends identifiers which specifies the content and the background video material and the foreground video material included in the content which the user selects to the distribution device, the content controlling unit performs a sending request of material data and a time management of the sending request based on scene description data which is sent from the distribution device, and receives the material data which is distributed from the distribution device and outputs the material data as video data, the distribution device further includes a scene description data generating unit operable to generate scene description data which describes the material data included in the content including the background video material and the foreground video material and a reproduction timing of the material data based on the identifiers which are sent from the selection information sending unit, and send the scene description data to the reproduction device, and the material data distributing unit selects corresponding material data based on the sending request from the reproduction device and distributes the material data to the reproduction device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a user can select and specify not only a content that he/she wants to be distributed but also a background video and a foreground video included in the content. That is, the user has a wider selection of not only a content itself but also a content video element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Here, the content selecting unit may accept from a user a selection of a content and a selection of a background video material and a foreground video material included in the content, and accept an editing of a display position and a reproduction time of the background video material and the foreground video material, the reproduction device may further include a scene description data generating unit operable to generate scene description data which describes material data included in the content and a reproduction timing of the material data based on the selection and the editing which the content selecting unit accepts, the selection information sending unit may send the scene description data along with the identifier which specifies the content which the user selects, and the material data distributing unit may distribute material data to the reproduction device based on the identifier and the scene description data which are sent from the reproduction device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a user can also edit a display position and a reproduction time of a background video material and a foreground video material included in a content just as the user&apos;s style, and therefore the user can experience gratification as if he enjoys his/her original content work that he/she creates as a producer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, the content selecting unit may accept from a user a selection of a content and a selection of a background video material and a foreground video material included in the content, and accept an editing of a display position and a reproduction time of the background video material and the foreground video material, the reproduction device may further include a scene description data generating unit operable to generate scene description data which describes material data included in the content and a reproduction timing of the material data based on the selection and the editing, and output the scene description data along with an identifier which specifies the selected content, the content controlling unit may perform a sending request of material data and a time management of the sending request via the selection information sending unit based on the scene description data which is outputted from the scene description data generating unit, and receive the material data which is distributed from the distribution device and output the material data as video data, and the material data distributing unit may distribute corresponding material data to the reproduction device based on the identifier and the sending request from the reproduction device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a user can customize details of a content such as a display position and a reproduction time of a video material to his/her taste. In addition, as the details of the user&apos;s original editing are generated as scene description data in the reproduction device, interpreted in the reproduction device and used for the sending request control for the distribution device, the need for the interpretation of the scene description data per user and the control based on the interpretation results is eliminated, and therefore the processing load in the distribution device can be lessened (or decentralized to each reproduction device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, in order to achieve the above-mentioned second object, in the content distribution system according to the present invention, the scene description data generating unit includes: a scene description database which holds in advance scene description data on a plurality of contents which are to be selected; and an authoring unit operable to read out, from the scene description database, scene description data corresponding to a content indicated by the identifier which is sent from the selection information sending unit, revise the read-out scene description data with information which specifies a material indicated by the identifier, and generate the revised scene description data, and the distribution device further includes a billing unit operable to determine a charging price for the distribution of the content by referring to a price list which is held in advance based on the scene description data which is generated by the authoring unit, and generate price data indicating the charging price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Or, the material data distributing unit includes: a material database which holds in advance a plurality of video material data and a plurality of sound material data which are to be selected; and an authoring unit operable to read out corresponding video material data and sound material data from the material database based on the sending request or the scene description data from the reproduction device, and distribute the video material data or sound material data to the reproduction device, and the distribution device further includes a billing unit operable to determine a charging price for the distribution of the content by reading out prices corresponding to the video material data and the sound material data which the authoring unit reads out from a price list which is held in advance, and generate price data indicating the charging price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, not a uniform price system per content work, but more detailed price system can be applied corresponding to a material selected by a user, which is more satisfying to the user. Also, according to this billing system, as the price is charged to each material included in the content, not to the entire content, there is a merit of dealing with the material individually in terms of a copyright or a portrait right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in order to achieve the above-mentioned third object, in the content distribution system according to the present invention, the content selecting unit shows a user a virtual video object corresponding to the selected background video material and foreground video material, and accepts the editing of the display position including a position on a screen and an order of depth by a user&apos;s operation on the video object. Accordingly, a user can view a plurality of rectangular windows showing video streams efficiently on the same screen simultaneously by selecting a plurality of foreground video materials to the user&apos;s taste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention can be realized as a single unit of a distribution device or a reproduction device included in the content distribution system, as a content distribution method including a step that is a component of the content distribution system, or as a program causing a computer to function as the step, for distribution of a content via a recording medium such as a CD-ROM and a communication network or a transmission medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is believed that the present invention produces a new type of entertainments and benefits for a user, and its practical value is extremely high.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the operations of the content distribution and billing system of the first embodiment for the present invention that is configured as above, according to a sequence as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (a flow of main processing of the present system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The content element selecting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> acquires a selection of a content work and a selection of a background video material, a foreground video material such as a person or a non-living thing and a sound material included in the content according to a user&apos;s instruction (Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). This content element selecting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> does not have materials themselves such as actual videos and sounds in order to help a user select a content. Instead, the content element selecting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> stores in advance still pictures and sample sounds, etc. indicating typical scenes of a video, displays them visually as a menu in a manner of distinguishing from each other by the names of these materials, and therefore acquires a user&apos;s selection instruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As a result of this selection processing, the content element selecting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> generates content element selection information including a content identifier, a background video material identifier, a foreground video material identifier and a sound material identifier, and sends it to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. When there is a limit to a number of materials which can be selected depending upon a content work, materials of the number within the limit are selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Note that a foreground video material is a video material of a person or a non-living thing itself with the background thereof being deleted. It is generally called a video object in an arbitrary shape, and is defined by a pair of shape data (mask data) and video data. As a compression method of this kind of video object in an arbitrary shape, MPEG-4 (Moving Picture Experts Group 4) has been known. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Separately from the above processing in the billing unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> generates scene description data and material data which are to be distributed to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to be prepared for sending (Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Specifically, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> acquires from the scene description database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> the scene description data corresponding to the content identifier of the content element selection information which is sent from the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, the &ldquo;scene description data&rdquo; is so-called script description data including (A) a time and synchronous control description indicating when and how long each video material data or sound material data is repeatedly reproduced, (B) a video material stream identification description for specifying a video material, (C) a video material stream layout/scale description indicating in which position and how much scale the video material is displayed on the display screen, (D) a video material attribute description indicating a video material size, a data format and a compression format when the video material is compressed, (E) a video material layer description indicating in which layer each video material is displayed when the videos are displayed in layers (in other words, the drawing order of layered drawings), (F) a sound stream identification description for specifying a sound material, and (G) a sound stream attribute description indicating a data format of sound data and a compression format when the sound data is compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> acquires the background video material data and the foreground video material data corresponding to the background video material identifier and the foreground video material identifier of the content element selection information respectively from the video material database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and acquires the sound data corresponding to the sound material identifier from the sound material database <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Note that the acquired background video material data, foreground video material data and sound material data are data files of a stream format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Then, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> describes (revises) the file names of the read-out files in the corresponding portions of the video material stream identification description and the sound stream identification description of the above-mentioned scene description data. Note that when one content includes a plurality of video/sound material data, the content element selecting unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> specifies to which portion of the scene description each material corresponds in an identifiable condition according to a user&apos;s selection, and make the information included in the content element selection information. Therefore, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> reads out a plurality of material data from the video material database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the sound material database <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by referring to such information included in the content element selection information, and registers the file names of these data in the corresponding portions of the scene description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> packetizes the read-out and revised scene description data, and sends them to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Note that the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> also packetizes the video and sound material data as a multiplex stream, and distributes them in a stream to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (after waiting for the after-mentioned request information to be sent from the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) (Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

The body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a plurality of stream data, in which each material data itself is allocated to each channel. This is defined in a form of a two-dimensional array of a channel number and a time (a frame number). Also, when there are a plurality of multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (there are usually a plurality of them), packet numbers are included in the header <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the order of reproduction start time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing a detailed configuration of the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> roughly includes an input processing unit (a packet data identifying unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>), processing units for a multiplex stream packet (a header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and a stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>), processing units for a scene description data packet (a scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and a time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>) and processing units for reproduction output and synchronization (a sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, a video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The packet data identifying unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives packet data which is transferred from the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, decides that the packet is either the scene description data packet <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> or the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> based on the identifier included in the header, and as a result, transfers the packet data to the scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> when it is the scene description data packet <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and to the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> when it is the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As for a content distribution, scene description data is first distributed and then a multiplex stream is distributed, as mentioned above.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> sorts and organizes each material according to the reproduction start time based on the material information which is sent from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, performs a time management (such as a control of a reproduction start and end) and a synchronization management (such as a control for synchronizing a reproduction timing between each material) of content reproduction, and gives a read-in notice and a reproduction control notice of the material data required for reproduction to the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> in the case of sound material data and to the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in the case of video material data, respectively. Note that since the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has not yet been sent when the content reproduction starts, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> gives a sending notice to request the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to send material data required for the content reproduction start and notifies it of a material identifier of the required material, without giving a notice to the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> generates request information which includes the organized material identifiers requested to be sent by the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and sends the request information to the distribution device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The request information which is sent is transferred to the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> converts the material data indicated by the request information into the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and sends it to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above (Step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which is sent is transferred to the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Note that there are usually a plurality of multiplex stream packets for the request information, and these packets are sequentially generated and sequentially sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Next, operations of the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the time when the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is sent will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The packet data identifying unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> identifies the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and then sends it to the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> having an input buffer once holds in the buffer the multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which are sequentially sent, checks the packet numbers of the headers <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the order that they are sent and sorts them in numerical order, sends them to an output buffer of a FIFO (first in, first out) type, and sends data information of each channel to the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> reads out the multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from the FIFO type output buffer included in the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, and separates stream data of each channel and sends to the stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is configured so as to hold stream data for each channel as well as to read it out from the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (that is, the stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> has two output ports so as to read out concurrently), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as for the data which is to be read out from the stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> sends an instruction, based on the header information of each channel which is sent from the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, to the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> in the case of sound material data and to the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in the case of video material data, respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> confirms whether or not there is the sound material data which is notified from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in the stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that there is no sound material data there when there is no data, and notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the channel number and packet number of the stream data which is now being read out when there is the sound material data. At the same time, the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> sends the read-out sound material data to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to have it reproduce the sound (Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Note that when the sound material data is compressed, it is expanded in the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, and the expanded data is sent to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> confirms whether or not there is the video material data which is notified from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in the stream buffer <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that there is no sound material data there when there is no data, and notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the channel number and packet number of the stream data which is now being read out when there is the video material data. At the same time, the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> sends the read-out video material data to the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> according to the screen layout and layer which are notified from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> so that the videos are displayed in the indicated screen positions in the order from the backward layer, and has the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reproduce the videos (Step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Note that the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> usually has a frame memory, and the address of the frame memory corresponds to the screen position one to one.

Note that when the video material data is compressed, it is expanded in the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and the expanded data is sent to the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When the sound data output control unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> or the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> notifies that &ldquo;there is no material data&rdquo;, or when there is material data which is not being reproduced now but needs to be reproduced within a predetermined time as a result of monitoring the time management status of reproduction start time, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> notifies the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the material information to request it to send the necessary material data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> receives the notice, it repeats the above-mentioned processing (Steps S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and thereby continues the reproduction processing by repeating the distribution of the necessary sound data and video data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Note that as for the last material in reproducing a content, an identifier indicating the reproduction end (an end identifier) as well as the material information are sent from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The end identifier which is sent from the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to the distribution device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the above-mentioned procedure is recognized by the authoring unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and the distribution of the content is completed at the time when the sending of the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the last material is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows how it looks like when the sound data and video data which are distributed according to the above-mentioned communication procedure are reproduced in the reproduction device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this example, a song named &ldquo;Over the Starry Sky&rdquo; which is arranged for a &ldquo;gorgeous version&rdquo; by an orchestral performance is played from the loud speakers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and an animated persons which are assimilated to a singing group &ldquo;SMOP&rdquo; are dancing to the song with a background &ldquo;constellation&rdquo; on the display screen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This kind of a music arrangement method and a combination of the foreground (dancing by animated persons) and the background (landscape) are specified in advance by a user&apos;s selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to this embodiment for the present invention, a user can select not only one object but also individual elements (a performance type of music, and a background and a foreground of a video) included in the selected content to his/her taste when he/she views and listens to the content. In other words, a user can enjoy viewing and listening to a content of which details are arranged by himself/herself and a layout is developed to his/her wish. As a result, the user can find satisfaction as if he/she viewed and listened to his/her own original content, not just receives a standard content unilaterally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Also, since the charging price of the content is calculated based on individual elements which the user selects, the user&apos;s intention is reflected in detail and therefore the user can be satisfied with the price system, differently from the conventional price system in which the price is determined uniformly for the applicable content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Although, in the present embodiment, one or more background videos and one or more foreground videos are displayed on the entire screen, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> plurality of rectangular windows showing video streams may be displayed on one screen. That is, by defining correspondence between individual foreground videos and rectangular windows showing video streams which are displayed independently of the screen, a user can view and listen to a plurality of video streams corresponding to a plurality of foreground videos selected by the user on the same screen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The distribution device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is a distribution server including a computer or the like that generates a multiplex stream packet based on the content identifier and scene description data which are sent from the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, performs its stream distribution to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and sends the price information, functionally includes a sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, an authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a billing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, a video material database <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and a sound material database <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is a sending and receiving circuit, a driver software or the like for communicating with the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads out corresponding material data from the material databases <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> based on the content identifiers and scene description data which are sent from the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> so as to generate a multiplex stream packet (material data), and outputs it to the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The billing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> determines the prices corresponding to various identifiers which are notified by the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and notifies the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the determination results as the price data via the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The video material database <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the sound material database <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> are respectively hard disks or the like that store in advance video material data and sound material data of all contents subject to distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Operations of the content distribution and billing system according to the second embodiment for the present invention as configured as above will be explained below according to a sequence (a flow of the main processing of the present system) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> acquires selections of a content work, and a background video material, a foreground video material such as a person or non-living thing, and a sound material included in the content according to a user&apos;s instruction, and acquires specifications of the screen layout and reproduction start time of these materials (Step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an example of a graphical user interface which the content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> provides. In this figure, a user first selects a desired content among a content selection menu <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the upper right. The user&apos;s selection specifies the template of the content on which the corresponding screen layout and reproduction start time are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, since a list of plurality of video materials which are to be determined corresponding to the selected content is displayed in the video material selection menu <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the user selects a background material and a foreground material among the displayed list. Similarly, since a list of plurality of sound materials which are to be determined corresponding to the selected content is displayed in the sound material selection menu <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the user selects a sound material among the displayed list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The selected video material (template) is displayed on a dummy content displaying unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>as a virtual video material (a simple video object such as an outline video) corresponding to the selected video material. At the same time, it is displayed on a track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>as a video track indicating a video display time and period for reproduction of the whole content. Note that the descending display order of the video tracks in the track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>corresponds to that of the layers in the display screen, that is, the top video track corresponds to the backmost layer on the video screen. As for the sound material, the selected sound material (template) is displayed as a sound track on the track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, and the sound output time and period for reproduction of the whole content can be recognized. A rectangle marked between a start time and an end time of the material is displayed on the track, and the corresponding material name is displayed within the rectangle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The user retouches the content which is displayed as a template via a dialogue with (a selection operation in) the content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. That is, the user edits a screen layout by moving a virtual video material displayed on the dummy content displaying unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, moves a reproduction start time by moving a rectangle of a video track or a sound track on the track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, or changes a reproduction period by changing a scale of a rectangle. As a result, the user can work out his/her own original content by editing the template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> When the operations are completed in the content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, it is notified to the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that they are completed, and the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> converts the editing results in the content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> into scene description data (Step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). As a result of this conversion, as for each video material in the graphical user interface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> display position such as a screen layout in the dummy content displaying unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is defined according to a relative position from the upper left corner, for example, a layer is defined according to the order of the video tracks in the track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, a reproduction start time and end time are defined according to a position of a rectangle indicating the reproduction start time and period of the video material in the track, and a reproduction period is defined according to a length of the lower side of the rectangle (the difference between the start time and the end time). Likewise, as for each sound material, a reproduction start time, end time and a reproduction period are defined based on the settings of the sound track displayed on the track editing screen <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. These are described in a predetermined format as scene description data. Note that the selected background video material, foreground video material or sound material is described in the scene description data in a form of a material identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the scene description data generated in the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is sent to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of the distribution device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> along with the content identifier indicating the selected content via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> sends the sent content identifier and scene description data to the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> sends the content identifier, the material identifiers of the background video material, foreground video material and sound material which are described in the scene description data to the billing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. The billing unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> calculates the charging prices in the same manner as the first embodiment, and generates the price calculation data (Step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> analyzes the details of the scene description which is sent from the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and organize the reproduction start time, end time and reproduction period of the material data defined in each description, the compression method when the material data is compressed, and further the reproduction position and layer in the display device when the data is a video material as stream information for each material (Step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Next, the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads out the video material data from the video material database <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the sound material data from the sound material database <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> in the order of earlier reproduction start time, and generates the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> according to the schedule based on the reproduction period described in the scene description data (Step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). At this time, the header <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is made up from the stream information corresponding to each material, and the body <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is generated by storing the read-out material data in a data area of each channel in a stream data format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Note that the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has the header hold packet numbers corresponding to the reproduction order because there are usually a plurality of multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> generated in the authoring unit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are sequentially sent to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The last identifier is added to the header <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the last multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which is sent from the distribution device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transferred to the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing a detailed configuration of the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the first embodiment. The content controlling unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> includes processing units for the multiplex stream packet (a header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, a demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and a stream buffer <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>) and processing units for reproduction output (a sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and an video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>). Note that, differently from the first embodiment, the scene description data is generated in the reproduction device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the distribution control of multiplex stream (control initiative) is under the distribution device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment, and therefore, the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> does not have components corresponding to the input processing unit (the packet data identifying unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>), the processing units for the scene description data packet (the scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>) and the processing unit on reproduction synchronization (the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>) included in the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> has a buffer, and the multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which are sequentially sent are once held in the buffer. Then, the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> checks the packet numbers of the headers of the packets in the order of sending, sorts them in the numerical order, and sends them to a FIFO-type output buffer. Thereby, the time management and synchronization control of a content reproduction are performed. On the other hand, as for the material data which is to be read out from the stream buffer, based on the stream information of each channel of the header, the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> instructs the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> to read out the sound material data and the video material data, respectively, and at the same time, it instructs the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> to control reproduction regarding the screen layout and layer when the data is the video material data. Note that when the last multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is sent, the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> determines the end based on the end identifier of the header, and completes the reproduction processing of the content after the following processing is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> reads out the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from the FIFO-type buffer at the backside of the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, separates the data stream per channel, and sends it to the stream buffer <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>. The stream buffer <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> holds the stream per channel, and has a configuration which makes it possible to read out the data from the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> reads out to the stream buffer <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> the sound material data which is notified from the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, sends the sound material data to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so as to have it reproduce the sound (Step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). Note that when the sound material data is compressed, it is expanded in the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, and the expanded data is sent to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> reads out the video material data which is notified from the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, sends the video material data to the indicated screen position of the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the order of the backward layer according to the screen layout and layer instructed by the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> so as to have the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> reproduce and display the video (Step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The content which a user selects and edits is distributed in a stream and reproduced in the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in this way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the second embodiment, when a user views and listens to a content, he/she selects not only an object, but also a template of a scene description via a graphical user interface, edits a layout and layer or a reproduction timing of each video material and a reproduction timing of a sound material, and thus customizes the content to his/her taste. Therefore, the user can receive the distribution of the content closer to his/her taste than that in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when a rectangular window showing a video stream which is independent per foreground video is displayed on a screen, a user can view and listen to a plurality of rectangular windows showing video streams on the same screen by selecting a plurality of foreground video materials to his/her taste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> (The Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, a content distribution and billing system according to the third embodiment for the present invention will be explained with reference to figurers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing a configuration of a content distribution and billing system according to the third embodiment for the present invention. This system includes a reproduction device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a distribution device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which are connected to each other via the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When the user completes the editing operation of the content, the completion is notified to the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, and the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> converts and generates the scene description data based on the editing result in the content element selection editing unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in the same manner as the second embodiment (Step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The scene description data which is generated in the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is sent to the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> along with the content identifier describing the selected content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing a detailed configuration of the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the first embodiment. The content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> roughly includes processing units for multiplex stream packets (a header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, a demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and a stream buffer <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>), processing units for scene description data packets (a scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> and a time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>) and processing units for a reproduction output and synchronization (a sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, a video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and a stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>), and corresponds to the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without the packet data identifying unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The scene description data and content identifier which are sent from the scene description generating unit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> are transferred to the scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>. The scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> interprets the scene description data (Step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). That is, the scene description interpreting unit <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> sends to the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> material information organized per material including a classification of a video material and a sound material and the material identifiers (a video material identifier and a sound material identifier), a reproduction start time, end time and a reproduction period of each material, a compression method when the material is compressed, and the reproduction position and layer on the display device when the material is a video material along with the content identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> sorts and organizes each material from the material information based on its reproduction start time, and gives the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, respectively, a reading notice of the material data, that is, the sound material data and the video material data, necessary for time management and synchronization management of the content reproduction and the reproduction itself. When the reproduction of the content is started, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> first gives the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> a sending notice of the content, and then transfers the material identifier of the material necessary for the content reproduction start and the content identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> generates request information which is the organized material identifiers which are sent from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, sends the request information and content identifier to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the distribution device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The sent request information and content identifier are transferred from the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> to the authoring unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The authoring unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> sends the content identifier and the material identifier of the request information to the billing unit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. The billing unit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, having in advance predetermined price lists for each of the selected content work (content identifier), background video material, foreground video material and sound material (the material identifiers), calculates the charging price by retrieving the price lists by the content identifier, background video material identifier, foreground video material identifier and sound material identifier, and adding up the prices retrieved from the price lists as charging prices until the last material necessary for the content reproduction is sent, and generates the price data (Step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). When the billing unit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> receives the notice from the authoring unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> that the sending of the last material is completed, the calculated price data is sent to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> of the reproduction device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the price information is indicated by the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The authoring unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> reads out the video material data from the video material database <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the sound material data from the sound material database <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, respectively, according to the material identifiers of the request information, and generates the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The header <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is generated in the same manner as the first embodiment. Note that there are usually a plurality of multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and the packet numbers corresponding to the reproduction order are held in the headers. The generated multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are sequentially sent to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> of the reproduction device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the sending and receiving <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and the communication medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (Step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The last identifier is added to the header <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the last multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Also, when the last multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is sent, it is notified to the billing unit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which is sent to the sending and receiving unit <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is transferred to the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> of the content controlling unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> has a buffer which once holds the multiplex stream packets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which are sequentially sent, checks the packet numbers of the headers in the sending order and sorts them in the numerical order, sends them to the FIFO type output buffer, and sends the data information of each channel to the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The demultiplexing unit <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> reads out the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from the FIFO type buffer at the backside of the header analyzing unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, and separates the stream data for each channel and sends it to the stream buffer <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>. The stream buffer <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> has a configuration that make it possible to hold stream data per channel, and to read out from the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as for the data which is to be read out from the stream buffer, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> sends the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> and the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> an instruction of reading the sound material data and the video material data, respectively, based on each of the sent channel data information. Note that as for the video material data, it gives an instruction of the screen layout and layer at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> confirms whether or not there is the notified sound material data in the stream buffer <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>, notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> that there is not sound material data when there is no data, notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of the channel number and the packet number of the stream data which is now being read out when there is the data, and sends the sound material data to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so as to have it reproduce the sound (Step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Note that when the sound material data is compressed, it is expanded in the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> and the expanded data is sent to the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> confirms whether or not there is the notified video material data in the stream buffer <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>, notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> that there is no video material data when there is no data, and notifies the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of the channel number and the packet number of the stream data which is now being read out when there is the data. The video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> sends the video material data to the instructed screen position in the order of backward layer according to the screen layout and layer instructed by the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, and the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> displays the data (Step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When the sound data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> or the video data output controlling unit <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> notifies that &ldquo;there is no material data&rdquo;, the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> monitors the management status of the reproduction time, and sends the material identifier to the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> to notify it to send the necessary material data when there is material data which is not being reproduced now but needs to be reproduced within a predetermined time. When the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> receives the notice, it performs the same processing as above (Steps S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Also, the material identifier of the last material in the content reproduction is sent from the time management controlling unit <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> to the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> along with the end identifier. The end identifier which is sent from the stream request controlling unit <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> according to the above procedure is recognized by the authoring unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the billing unit <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> sends the price data as mentioned above at the time when the sending of the multiplex stream packet <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the last material is completed, and the distribution of the content is also completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The stream distribution of the content which the user selects and edits is performed, and the content is displayed in the content displaying unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the content sound outputting unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, in the above-mentioned manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to this embodiment, a user does not only selects an object but can edit a content via a graphical user interface and customize it in detail to his/her taste. Furthermore, since the control of the distribution (the initiative of sending request) is not under the distribution device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> but under the reproduction device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the processing load on the distribution device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in controlling distribution is decentralized and reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Although the content distribution and billing system according to the present invention has been explained above based on the embodiments, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> For example, although, according to the above embodiments, the characteristic processing units in the reproduction device and the reproduction device (the content element selecting unit, the content element selection editing unit, the scene description generating unit, the content controlling unit, the authoring unit, the billing unit, etc.) are realized as programs which are executed on the computer for general use, they may be realized on the logic circuit for exclusive use or the like. Also, the communication medium need not be a special one if two-way communication is possible, nor the communication media for an up-line and a down-line need not be identical to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Also, as for the timing of generating the multiple stream packets in the distribution device, (I) when the data for the multiple stream packet (material data) is determined, the distribution device may generate and hold all the packets, and distribute the corresponding packet every time it receives each request (request information, etc.), or (II) the distribution device may generate and distribute the packet after receiving each request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as for the timing of the billing processing, (I) the charging price may be determined at the time when the subject data is selected, or (II) the charging price may be determined (added) according to the number of packets which have actually been distributed. That is because it is possible to apply the price system depending upon a user&apos;s selection of a content and the materials of the content in either method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although according to the above embodiments, various databases (the scene description database, the video material database and the sound material database) are included in the distribution device, they may be included in a remote data server or the like which is connected to the distribution device via a transmission path. Similarly, the billing unit need not be included in the distribution device but may be included in a computer device for exclusive use for billing which is located in a credit loan company, etc. </paragraph>
