<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a process for pretreating a very acid natural gas containing a substantial amount of acid compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S) and carbon dioxide (CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The work done by the applicant had allowed to propose, in patent EP-0,665,046, a process intended to eliminate a substantial amount of the acid compounds present in the natural gas at the well outlet, a process whose simplicity enabled ready implementation with a minor investment. According to the process, the initial natural gas is contacted in a cyclone type enclosure with a liquid rich in acid compounds so as to obtain, on the one hand, at the top of the cyclone enclosure, a gaseous fraction depleted in acid compounds and on the other hand, at the bottom of the enclosure, a liquid phase containing the major part of the acid compounds and water. The liquid phase collected at the bottom of the enclosure is reinjected into a well nearing depletion. The gaseous fraction obtained at the top of the cyclone enclosure is cooled to a low temperature (down to &minus;30&deg; C.), then sent to a separating drum to obtain, on the one hand, a gas freed of acid compounds and, on the other, a condensate rich in acid compounds which is recycled to the cyclone enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, the process described in patent EP-0,665,046 comprises drawbacks: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1) The presence of water in the gaseous fraction cooled to a low temperature is likely to lead, throughout the circuit, to the formation of solid hydrates that may eventually clog the pipes or damage the constituent elements of the device used. This is why the process described in patent EP-0,665,046 recommended the use of an anti-hydrate, preferably methanol, to prevent hydrate formation during cooling of the gaseous fraction from the cyclone enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2) An appreciable amount of hydrocarbons is carried along with the liquid phase collected at the bottom of the cyclone enclosure. The loss of hydrocarbons carried along with the liquid at the bottom of the cyclone enclosure can reach 10% of the amount of gas treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is notably to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered by the applicant that it is possible, under suitable thermodynamic conditions, to concentrate the initial natural gas with methane while removing the majority of the acid gases and substantially all of the water it contains. The expression substantially all of the water means that the amount of water present in the final gas is less than 50 ppm by mole, preferably less than 10 ppm by mole, and more preferably less than 5 ppm by mole. The present invention proposes replacing the cyclone type contacting enclosure by several contacting zones, each contacting zone being operated under predetermined pressure and temperature conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention also proposes using various means for cooling the gaseous fraction obtained at the top of the cyclone enclosure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention proposes a process for pretreating a natural gas under pressure containing hydrocarbons, at least one of the acid compounds H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and water, the process comprising the following stages: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In stage d) of the process according to the invention, the gas phase obtained in stage c) can be cooled by means of a venturi neck, said liquid phase being discharged in the vicinity of the venturi neck and said gas phase being collected at the outlet of the divergent tube of the venturi neck. The liquid phase discharged in the vicinity of the venturi neck can be cooled to produce the liquid recycled to stage c) and a gas phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The gas phases obtained in stages d) and e) can be used to cool the gas phase obtained in stage c) and/or to cool the natural gas in stage a). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The liquid obtained in stage b) can be heated in the first contact zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In stage a) of the process according to the invention, the natural gas can be at a pressure of 8 MPa and at a temperature above 15&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The liquids obtained in stages a) and b) can be injected into a well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, after treating the natural gas from the production well, a final gas containing the major part of the hydrocarbons contained in the gas before treatment is recovered. What is referred to as the major part of the hydrocarbons is at least 90% hydrocarbons, preferably at least 95% hydrocarbons and most preferably at least 97% hydrocarbons in relation to the hydrocarbons contained in the gas before treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention advantageously allows to avoid using an anti-hydrate such as methanol, whose transportation, use and regeneration are generally expensive, complex and which is dangerous to handle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the example of embodiment of the process according to the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> very acid natural gas coming from a production well through a line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) at a pressure of 8 MPa and a temperature of 50&deg; C., saturated with water (3600 ppm by mole), containing 32% by mole of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S, 11% by mole of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 57% by mole of methane (less than 1% by mole of C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>), is fed into a heat exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) where it is cooled to 30&deg; C. The cooling temperature is selected so as to be slightly higher than the temperature of hydrate formation at the pressure of the natural gas flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The fluid at the outlet of exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) is fed through a line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) into a separator (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>), and a liquid effluent containing essentially water and a very low proportion of dissolved acid compounds is discharged through a line (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). This liquid effluent can possibly be heated in heat exchanger (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). A water-saturated gas containing 1550 ppm by mole of water is also discharged from separator (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) through a line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Cooling in exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) thus allows to obtain a gas with a much lower water content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The gas flowing out of separator (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is fed into a first contacting zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). This contacting zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) works at a pressure of 7.97 MPa and a temperature of about 17&deg; C. It can consist of a drum provided with packings known to the man skilled in the art. It receives, through a line (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), a liquid stream consisting of a majority of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S (about 70% by mole) at a temperature of about 5&deg; C. A mixture is thus formed by contacting the gas flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the liquid flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). This contacting operation simultaneously allows to </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> increase the molar fraction of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S in the mixture contained in zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> dissolve the (mainly sulfur-based) solid particles possibly present in the mixture contained in zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). The work done by Alberta Sulfur Research Ltd. and presented in the publication entitled &lt;&lt;Recent Developments in the Mitigation of Sulfur Deposition in Sour Gas Facilities&gt;&gt; (P. D. Clark, P. Davis, J. Simion, E. Fitzpatrick and C. S. C. Lau&mdash;Laurance Reid Gas Conditioning Conference 1995, Norman, Okla.) shows in fact that the solubility of sulfur is substantially increased when the molar percentage of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S in the mixture exceeds 40%, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> obtain a partially dehydrated gas flowing out of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). In fact, the water contained in the gas flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is absorbed by the liquid flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) because water has a higher affinity for H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S than for hydrocarbons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A liquid consisting of more than 75% by mole of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S, the rest being water, CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and a low proportion of methane carried along, is obtained at the bottom of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). The hydrates are possibly recovered as deposits in this part of the zone. This liquid is discharged through line (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), possibly heated in exchanger (<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>), mixed with the liquid effluent collected at the bottom of separator (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) and discharged through line (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) by means of a pump (<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>) at a pressure of 38 MPa prior to being reinjected into a depleted oil well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The temperature of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) is adjusted so as to be sufficiently high to prevent hydrate formation. However, in cases where hydrates should form, contacting zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) can be designed as a cyclone type enclosure so as to prevent clogging by the solid particles. A heating means (<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) can also be used to raise the temperature of the mixture in zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) above the hydrate formation temperature. This heating means can consist of a reboiler (<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) heating the liquid at the bottom of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). The heat supplied by reboiler (<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>) also allows to vaporize the hydrocarbons present in the liquid at the bottom of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) and thus to limit the loss of hydrocarbons carried along with the liquid discharged through line (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) at the bottom of zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> At the top of contact zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), a gas essentially consisting of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S (33% by mole), CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(12% by mole) and methane (54% by mole) and greatly depleted in water (<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> ppm by mole) is discharged through line (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The gas coming from first contact zone (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is fed into a second contacting zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). This contacting zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) works at a pressure of 7.94 MPa and a temperature of about 5&deg; C. It receives a liquid stream consisting of about 50% by mole of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S through a line (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), which is at a temperature of about &minus;30&deg; C. This liquid H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S makeup, which contains practically no water any more (40 ppm by mole), allows to remove the majority of the water present in the gas contained in zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) as a result of the affinity of the dehydrated liquid H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S for water which is higher than the affinity of hydrocarbons for water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A gas essentially consisting of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S, CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and methane, and containing substantially no water any more (about 16 ppm by mole), is discharged through line (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) at the top of contact zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The gas carried by line (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) flows through various cooling systems to liquefy the acid compounds, and first a gas-gas heat exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). A fluid at about &minus;5&deg; C. is discharged from exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). This fluid is fed into a heat exchanger (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) using a propane coolant, for example, and flows out through line (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) at a temperature of &minus;30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fluid circulating in line (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is fed into separating drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). Drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) is at a temperature of &minus;30&deg; C. and a pressure of 7.88 MPa. A gas partially freed of acid compounds is discharged from drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and a condensate rich in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is discharged through line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). The condensate circulating in line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is recycled by means of pump (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) to contact zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The methane contained in the condensate circulating in line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is mostly recovered in contact zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The gas circulating in line (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) can be used as a cooling fluid in exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), then in exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Finally, a 823 kmol/h methane loss is observed, i.e. less than 7% by mole of the amount present in the feed flowing in through line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The feed gas has been freed of 4750 kmol/h of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S, i.e. 72% by mole of the amount present in the feed. The main advantage of the process according to the invention is to always use streams having molar fractions of water and associated temperatures which are such that hydrate formation is impossible. This is due in particular to the use of drum (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) allowing to reduce the amount of water present in the gas and to the use of the two contact zones (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) allowing to obtain a very water poor gas than can be cooled thereafter without hydrate formation risk. Thus, the process according to the invention does not require mixing the natural gas with an anti-hydrate compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Without departing from the scope of the invention, it is possible to use more than two contact zones. One or more contact zones working under intermediate thermodynamic conditions in relation to zones (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) can be arranged between contact zones (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

This drum (<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>) allows to separate an effluent rich in acid compounds, discharged through line (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), and a gas discharged through line (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). Line (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) carries the gas to an expander (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) where it undergoes an isentropic expansion. The stream flowing out of expander (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) is at a low temperature (about &minus;30&deg; C.) and it is sent through line (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) into separating drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). A gas partially freed of acid compounds is discharged from drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) and a condensate rich in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is discharged through line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). Separation of the gas partially freed of acid compounds and of the condensate rich in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is favoured by the low pressure value in drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) obtained after expansion of the gas in expander (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>). The pressure of the condensate circulating in line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is raised by means of pump (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) and the condensate is mixed with the liquid stream coming from drum (<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). This mixture is recycled to contact zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>) by means of pump (<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The gas flowing from drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) can be used as a cooling fluid in exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), then in exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>).

Compressor (<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) can be connected to expander (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) so as to use the isentropic expansion work as a source of energy. A second compressor supplied with energy by a source external to the process of the invention can also compress the gas from drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) in order to compensate for the energy loss upon the expansion and the compression performed by expander (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) connected to compressor (<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A third possible configuration of the device described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> allowing the present process to be applied is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stream discharged from exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) at a temperature of &minus;5&deg; C. is sent through a venturi neck type separator (<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows in detail venturi neck type separator (<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>). It comprises an inlet line (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) for the gas to be treated. This line (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) is extended by a convergent tube (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>), then by tube (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) of small diameter in relation to line (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). This tube (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is the venturi neck. Thus, the gas fed into line (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) undergoes a velocity increase that can reach a supersonic velocity in venturi neck (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). This velocity increase allows an isentropic expansion, i.e. a pressure and temperature reduction of the gas in venturi neck (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). If the gas treated contains acid compounds, they condense as fine droplets. Delta blades (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) arranged in venturi neck (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) impart the gas a swirling motion so that the condensate droplets are pressed against the inner wall of venturi neck (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) in form of a thin liquid film. A circumferential slot (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) arranged downstream from delta blades (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) in venturi neck (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) allows to recover the thin liquid film in enclosure (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) and to discharge it through line (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). Downstream from slot (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>), the gas separated from the condensed droplets undergoes a velocity decrease through divergent tube (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). This velocity decrease is accompanied by a pressure and temperature increase of the gas at the outlet of divergent tube (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). This type of separator can be, for example, a TWISTER Supersonic Separator marketed by the TWISTER BV company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the gas fed into separator (<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>) is expanded under isentropic conditions at the level of the venturi neck and cooled (30 bars and &minus;46&deg; C.). Thus, at the level of the venturi neck, an effluent rich in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S is condensed. This effluent is collected in the vicinity of the venturi neck and discharged through line (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). At the outlet of the venturi neck, the gas is channelled in a divergent tube, which allows its pressure and temperature to rise (75 bars and 19&deg; C.). The gas flows out of separator (<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The venturi neck type separator is a gas cooling means which requires no energy supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thanks to the fact that the stream circulating in line (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) only contains a small amount of water (about 16 ppm by mole), no hydrates are formed at the level of separator (<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>) or in the liquid effluent collected through line (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). Thus, the process according to the invention requires no continuous use of an anti-hydrate. The effluent circulating in line (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is cooled to &minus;30&deg; C. through heat exchanger (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) which can use a propane coolant. The cooled effluent is sent to drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) through line (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Drum (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) produces a liquid effluent rich in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S discharged through line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and a gas discharged through line (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). This gas circulating in line (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) is remixed with the gas circulating in line (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) so as to produce a gas mixture circulating in line (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). This gas mixture is used as a coolant in exchanger (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), then in exchanger (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) prior to being exported. The liquid effluent circulating in line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is sent back, by means of pump (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) and line (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), to contact zone (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
