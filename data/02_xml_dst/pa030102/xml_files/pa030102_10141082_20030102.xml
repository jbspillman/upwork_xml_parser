<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a battery pack, and more particularly, to a battery pack included in a battery, for example, a smart battery, used in a portable electronic apparatus such as a notebook computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the wiring structure of a battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a conventional smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an equivalent circuit corresponding to the wiring structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a resistance equivalent circuit corresponding to the wiring structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, the conventional smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a smart circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A negative pole output terminal of the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a negative pole terminal (B&minus;) of the smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, an 8 V (volts) positive pole output terminal of the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a 8 V positive pole terminal (8B&plus;) of the smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A 12 V positive pole output terminal of the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a 12 V positive pole terminal 12B&plus; of the smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As output terminals of the smart circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, there are a positive pole output terminal (P&plus;) connected to a 12 V positive pole terminal (12B&plus;), a negative pole output terminal (P&minus;) connected to a negative pole terminal (B&minus;), a clock terminal C, a data terminal D, and a temperature terminal T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the first through seventh secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are sequentially stacked from the position of output terminals of a pack connected to power input terminals B&minus;, 8B&plus;, and 12B&plus; of the smart circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Positive pole terminals of the first through third secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected in common by a conductive body to the 12 V positive pole terminal 12B&plus; of the smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, since the common connection portion of the positive pole terminals of the first through third secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> occupy most of the conductive body, internal resistance of the conductive body is not so high to need consideration in relation with the current paths. Also, negative pole terminals of the first through third secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and positive pole terminals of the fourth through sixth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected in common by a conductive body to the 8 V positive pole terminal 8B&plus; of the smart circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Here, since the common connection portion of the negative pole terminals of the first through third secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the positive pole terminals of the fourth through sixth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> occupy most of the conductive body, internal resistance of the conductive body is not so high to need consideration in relation with the current paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The ninth and eighth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are sequentially disposed from the positions of the output terminals of the pack in a row in a direction perpendicular to a direction in which the first through seventh secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are arranged. Positive pole terminals of the ninth and eighth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, negative pole terminals of the fourth through sixth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a positive pole terminal of the seventh secondary battery B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are connected in common by a second conductive body L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Here, since the common connection portion of the negative pole terminals of the fourth through sixth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the positive pole terminal of the seventh secondary battery B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> occupy most of a vertical portion of the second conductive body L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, internal resistance of the vertical portion is not so high to need consideration in relation with the current paths. However, because a horizontal portion of the second conductive body L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not so, internal resistance of the horizontal portion has a great effect in relation with the current paths. Meanwhile, negative pole terminals of the seventh, eighth, ninth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are connected in common by a first conductive body L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, most of the first conductive body L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is the longest than the other conductive bodies is disposed between a connection portion of the negative pole terminal of the ninth secondary battery B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a connection portion of the negative pole terminal of the eighth secondary battery B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, internal resistance of the first conductive body L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the greatest effect in relation with the current paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the current path through which current flows from the 12 V positive pole terminal 12B&plus; of the smart circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the negative pole terminal B&minus; can be branched to nine ways listed in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In Table 1, the internal resistance of the first conductive body L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is greater than that of the second conductive body L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, referring to Table 1, the resistance of the current path of the eighth secondary battery B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is the highest, the resistance of the current path of the seventh secondary battery B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is the second highest, the resistance of the current path of the ninth secondary battery B<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is the third highest, and the resistance of the current path of each of the remaining first through sixth secondary batteries B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is the lowest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the conventional battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to a simple internal wiring, charging/discharging performance of the eighth secondary battery B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is the worst and the life span thereof is the shortest. Therefore, performance of the smart battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> including the battery pack <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is low and the life span thereof is reduced. </paragraph>
