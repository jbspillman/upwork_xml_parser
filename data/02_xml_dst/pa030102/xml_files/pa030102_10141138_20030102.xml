<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A hydraulic engine-starting system for cranking and starting an engine for a vehicle having automatically stopping and starting functions by a hydraulic motor. A hydraulic pressure that operates a hydraulic clutch of a transmission is raised promptly by using a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic motor is driven by a hydraulic pressure supplied thereto through a first oil passage from a hydraulic motor-driving device including an oil pump, an accumulator and a solenoid valve, thereby starting the engine. A transmission is disposed in the middle of a second oil passage for returning an oil discharged from the hydraulic motor to the hydraulic motor-driving device.

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hydraulic engine-starting system for starting an engine for a vehicle having automatic stopping and starting functions by cranking the engine using a hydraulic motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Automatic engine-stopping and starting systems are known from Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 8-14076 and 2000-46165. They are designed so that when a vehicle is stopped during traveling and predetermined conditions are established, the engine is stopped automatically. Likewise, when an accelerator pedal is depressed to start the vehicle, the engine starts automatically, thereby saving fuel and reducing exhaust emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic pressure that operates a hydraulic clutch of a transmission is generated by an oil pump driven by the engine. For this reason, when the engine is stopped upon stopping the vehicle, the oil pump also stops. Therefore, even if the engine is started at the start of the vehicle to drive the oil pump, it is difficult to immediately raise the hydraulic pressure required to operate the hydraulic clutch of the transmission. Raising of the hydraulic pressure for the transmission is retarded for this reason. Thus, the hydraulic clutch is brought into engagement after increasing the rotational speed of the engine, a shock is then generated by the engagement of the hydraulic clutch, and smooth starting of the vehicle is not possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid this, the automatic engine-stopping and starting system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 8-14076 includes a large-sized accumulator in which a hydraulic pressure is accumulated by an oil pump driven by the engine. In this system, a working oil is supplied from the accumulator to the transmission at the start of the engine to ensure a hydraulic pressure required for the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. The automatic engine-stopping and starting system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-46165 includes an electric oil pump separate from an oil pump driven by the engine so that the hydraulic clutch of the transmission is operated by a hydraulic pressure generated by the electric oil pump at the start of the engine when the oil pump driven by the engine cannot generate a sufficient hydraulic pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An automatic engine-stopping and starting system is also known from Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 6-101606, which is designed so that a lubricating oil is supplied to portions of an engine, which are to be lubricated, by an electric hydraulic pump prior to the start of the engine, thereby preventing the portions from being abnormally worn at the start of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the automatic engine-stopping and starting system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 8-14076 requires the large-sized accumulator, and the automatic engine-stopping and starting system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-46165 requires the electric oil pump. Therefore, these systems suffer from increased cost, energy consumption, and battery consumption. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to ensure that the hydraulic pressure for operating the hydraulic clutch of the transmission and/or the hydraulic pressure for lubricating the engine is raised promptly by using a hydraulic motor to start the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, a hydraulic engine-starting system can be provided in a vehicle and include an engine and a transmission that transmits an output from the engine to driven wheels in a speed-changing manner. A hydraulic pressure source generates a hydraulic pressure, while an accumulator accumulates the hydraulic pressure generated thereby. A hydraulic motor starts the engine and a first oil passage supplies oil from the accumulator to the hydraulic motor while a second oil passage returns the oil from the hydraulic motor to the hydraulic pressure source. Oil flowing through the second oil passage is used as a working oil for the transmission and/or a lubricating oil for the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the hydraulic motor can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator via the first oil passage and the engine cranked and started by a driving force generated by the hydraulic motor. Since the oil discharged from the hydraulic motor maintains a sufficient hydraulic pressure and the transmission and/or engine is disposed at an intermediate portion of the second oil passage, the oil can be used as the working oil for the transmission and/or the lubricating oil for the engine. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, thereby starting the vehicle without generating any shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, portions of the engine, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, to thereby prevent abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The hydraulic engine-starting system can also include a third oil passage that circulates the oil between the transmission or the engine and an oil cooler, wherein at least one portion of the third oil passage also serves as at least one portion of the second oil passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, since at least one portion of the third oil passage also serves as at least one portion of the second oil passage, the length of the second oil passage is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the hydraulic engine-starting system is an oil pump driven by the hydraulic motor, wherein the oil supplied from the oil pump is used as a working oil for the transmission and/or a lubricating oil for the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the hydraulic motor can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator via the first oil passage and the engine cranked and started by a driving force generated by the hydraulic motor. In addition, the oil supplied from the oil pump is used as the working oil for the transmission and/or as the lubricating oil for the engine. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, to thereby start the vehicle without generating shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, portions of the engine, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, to thereby prevent abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the hydraulic engine-starting system, an oil supply device can be operated by the oil flowing through the first oil passage, wherein the oil supplied from the oil supply device is used as a working oil for the transmission and/or a lubricating oil for the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the hydraulic motor can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator via the first oil passage and the engine cranked and started by a driving force generated by the hydraulic motor. In addition, the oil supplied from the oil supply device is used as the working oil for the transmission and/or as the lubricating oil for the engine. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, to thereby start the vehicle without generating shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, portions of the engine, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine by the hydraulic motor, to thereby prevent abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a reservoir for the transmission can also be used as a reservoir for the hydraulic pressure source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the reservoir for the transmission is also used as the reservoir for the hydraulic pressure source and hence, it is unnecessary to mount a separate reservoir in the hydraulic pressure source, leading to a reduction in number of parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an oil pump can be used as the hydraulic pressure source in the present invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The mode for carrying out the present invention will now be described by way of embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> transmission T is integrally coupled to an engine E having automatically stopping and starting functions, and a starting system S is mounted to the engine E. The starting system S includes a starter shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supported on a pair of bearings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A drive gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is relatively non-rotatable and axially movable is carried on the starter shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An electromagnetic actuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that axially advances and retracts the drive gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also provided in the starting system S. A hydraulic motor Mh drives the starter shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a one-way clutch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, while an electric motor Me drives the starter shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a one-way clutch <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in a state in which the drive gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is advanced by the electromagnetic actuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and meshes with a driven gear <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided on a crankshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the engine E, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be cranked through the starter shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the drive gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the driven gear <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by driving the hydraulic motor Mh and the electric motor Me to start the engine E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic motor-driving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that drives the hydraulic motor Mh includes a pump-driving motor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is driven by the pump-driving motor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a reservoir <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to an intake port of the oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a check valve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are disposed sequentially from an upstream side to a downstream side of a first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that connects a discharge port of the oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the hydraulic motor Mh. The hydraulic motor Mh and the reservoir <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by a second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The transmission T is disposed between an upstream portion L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a downstream portion L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. An oil return pump <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> that returns oil to the reservoir <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the downstream portion L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is positioned within the transmission T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The transmission T is provided with a hydraulic circuit including a hydraulic clutch, a torque converter, a control valve and other such conventional features. The hydraulic circuit is operated by hydraulic pressure that is generated by an oil pump (not shown) driven by the engine E. The second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With the above-mentioned arrangement, the engine E having the automatically stopping and starting functions is automatically stopped by cutting off the supply of fuel when a vehicle is decelerated and stopped at an intersection, and is automatically started when a driver depresses an accelerator pedal. The starting of the engine E is carried out by the hydraulic motor Mh. Oil is discharged by the oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is operated by the pump-driving motor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and accumulates in the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Upon depressing the accelerator pedal, the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is opened for a predetermined period of time e.g., for 0.2 seconds, and oil from the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is supplied to the hydraulic motor Mh. Thus, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is cranked by the hydraulic motor Mh, which starts the engine E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The electric motor Me is used to start the engine E in such a circumstance where the hydraulic motor Mh or its driving system cannot be operated normally. Therefore, the electric motor Me is not used in a usual or common state. When the hydraulic motor Mh is driven, a driving force from the hydraulic motor Mh is cut off by the one-way clutch <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that the driving force cannot be transmitted to the electric motor Me. Likewise, when the electric motor Me is driven, a driving force from the electric motor Me is cut off by the one-way clutch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the driving force cannot be transmitted to the hydraulic motor Mh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the hydraulic motor Mh is driven at time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to start the cranking of the engine, and the engine E is started at time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, a hydraulic pressure, indicated by the broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, output from the oil pump driven by the engine E increases slowly in conjunction with an increase in the rotational speed of the engine. Therefore, a hydraulic pressure, indicated by the dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, required to appropriately control the hydraulic clutch of the transmission T, is provided at time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after a predetermined period of time from the start of the engine E lapses, and the vehicle cannot be started before time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the hydraulic clutch is brought into engagement at time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a shock is generated by the engagement of the hydraulic clutch, which impedes the smooth start because the rotational speed of the engine has been increased to a level higher than a required rotational speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment, however, when the hydraulic motor Mh is operated at time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the oil discharged from the hydraulic motor Mh still has a sufficient hydraulic pressure such that the oil is supplied via the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the transmission T simultaneously with the operation of the hydraulic motor Mh. Thus, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T is raised immediately to exceed the required hydraulic pressure. Therefore, the vehicle can be started without delay simultaneously with the start of the engine E and without generating the shock associated with the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Since the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is closed upon starting the engine E, the oil passed through the hydraulic motor Mh cannot be supplied to the transmission T. However, the oil pump already being driven by the engine E supplies a sufficient amount of the oil to the transmission T at this time. Accordingly, the operation of the transmission T can be continued without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the hydraulic motor Mh can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for accumulating the hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pressure source or oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The engine E can then be cranked and started by the driving force generated by the hydraulic motor Mh. Since the oil discharged from the hydraulic motor Mh still has a sufficient hydraulic pressure, the transmission T and/or engine E is disposed at the intermediate portion of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for returning the oil to the hydraulic pressure source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thus the oil can be used as the working oil for the transmission T and/or as the lubricating oil for the engine E. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor Mh to thus start the vehicle without generating any shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, the portions of the engine E, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor Mh, to prevent abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that the hydraulic motor-driving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not provided with the reservoir <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Rather, a reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is provided in the transmission T that also serves as a reservoir for the hydraulic motor-driving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which provides for a reduction in the number of parts. In the second embodiment, the intake port of the oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected directly to a downstream end of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is unnecessary to mount the oil return pump <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) in the transmission T with the purpose of returning the oil to the hydraulic motor-driving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which provides for a further reduction in the number of parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment differs from the second embodiment in that an oil cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is provided within a third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that connects the hydraulic circuit (not shown) of the transmission T with the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes an upstream section L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending from the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T to the oil cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, while a downstream section L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>b extends from the oil cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A portion of the upstream section L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also used as a portion of the downstream section L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this manner, using a portion of the third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the oil cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> as a portion of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the starting system S reduces the overall length of the oil passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In other words, since at least one portion of the third oil passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> used to circulate the oil to the oil cooler <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> also serves as at least one portion of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the overall length of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> used to operate the hydraulic motor Mh is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment includes an oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> mounted to an output shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic motor Mh. A discharge port of the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the transmission T are connected to each other by an upstream section L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a fourth oil passage L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, while the transmission T and intake port of the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by a downstream section L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the fourth oil passage L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The instant the hydraulic motor Mh is operated to start the engine E, the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is operated to supply the oil to the hydraulic circuit (not shown) of the transmission T. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine E to start the vehicle immediately. Moreover, a working oil for the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T and a working oil for the hydraulic motor Mh are completely separate from each other. Thus, it is possible to prevent a trouble from occurring in the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T, which is susceptible to contamination by foreign matters, due to the provision of a large number of control valves. The hydraulic motor Mh can use a working oil that is different from the working oil used for the transmission T. Moreover, the number of parts exposed to the high-temperature working oil for the transmission T is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth embodiment, the hydraulic motor Mh can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to accumulate the hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pressure source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the engine E can be cranked and started by the driving force generated by the hydraulic motor Mh. In addition, the oil supplied from the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> driven by the hydraulic motor Mh is used as the working oil for the transmission T and/or as the lubricating oil for the engine E. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor Mh, which provides for the starting of the vehicle without generating any shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, the portions of the engine E, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor Mh, which also prevent abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The fifth embodiment includes a fifth oil passage L<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> branched from the first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a location downstream of the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that communicates with an inlet port of an oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. An eighth oil passage L<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> communicating with a discharge port of the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a check valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a check valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a constriction <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> connected in parallel to the check valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, an accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> constituting a retarding means, and a stepped cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in which a stepped piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is slidably received. A smaller-diameter portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> communicates with the fifth oil passage L<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, while a larger-diameter portion of the cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> communicates with the transmission T through a sixth oil passage L<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> also having a check valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. An intermediate portion of the sixth oil passage L<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the transmission T communicate with each other through a seventh oil passage L<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which also has a check valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is opened for a predetermined time, the hydraulic motor Mh is operated to start the engine E. Simultaneously, a hydraulic pressure is applied to a port in the smaller-diameter portion of the stepped cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through the check valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to move the piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> leftwards. This causes the hydraulic pressure generated in a port in the larger-diameter portion of the stepped cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be supplied to the transmission T to operate the hydraulic circuit. As such, the vehicle can be started simultaneously with the start of the engine without generating any shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The operation at that time will be described in further detail. The hydraulic pressure supplied the instant the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is opened accumulates instantaneously in the accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the hydraulic pressure is supplied slowly from the accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> constituting the retarding means to the port of the smaller-diameter portion of the stepped cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which drives the piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Presuming the accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not provided, it is not possible to drive the piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> the necessary strokes merely by opening the solenoid valve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a short period of time, e.g., for 0.2 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For example, if the ratio of the area between the smaller-diameter portion and the larger-diameter portion of the piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is 1:10 and oil in an amount of 3 cc is supplied from the accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having an accumulated hydraulic pressure of, for example, 30 MPa, and the internal pressure in the accumulator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> drops to 10 MPa, the oil having a pressure of 1 MPa can be supplied in an amount of 30 cc from the cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the transmission T. As such, the pressure and flow rate of the oil supplied to the transmission T can be set at any value via the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if the hydraulic pressure of the oil supplied from the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the transmission T varies as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and is set to slightly exceed a hydraulic pressure, indicated by the dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, required for appropriately controlling the hydraulic clutch of the transmission as shown by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the consumption of the oil accumulated in the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be suppressed. Also, the electric power consumed by the pump-driving motor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> needed to drive the oil pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to a minimum, thereby contributing to the retrenchment of energy and reducing the capacity of the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the oil pump driven by the engine E exhibits a sufficient function after the start of the engine E, the piston <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is moved rightwards by the oil returned from the transmission T to the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the check valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Oil is then forced out of the cylinder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and returned through the constriction <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and check valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the reservoir <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic motor-driving device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The constriction <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is selected to have a diameter and length so that an influence is not exerted as much as possible during operation of the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, i.e., while supplying oil to the transmission T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The instant the hydraulic motor Mh is operated to start the engine E, the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> supplies oil to the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T. Thus, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine E to start the vehicle immediately. Moreover, since the working oil for the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T and the working oil for the hydraulic motor Mh are completely separated from each other, it is possible to prevent trouble from occurring in the hydraulic circuit of the transmission T, which is susceptible to contamination by foreign matters, due to the provision of the large number of control valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the hydraulic motor Mh can be driven by the oil supplied thereto from the accumulator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for accumulating the hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pressure source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the engine E can be cranked and started by the driving force generated by the hydraulic motor Mh. In addition, the oil supplied from the oil supply device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> operated by the oil flowing through the first oil passage L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as the working oil for the transmission T and/or as the lubricating oil for the engine E. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the transmission T can be raised simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor to start the vehicle without generating any shock due to the engagement of the hydraulic clutch. Alternatively or concurrently, portions of the engine E, which are to be lubricated, can be lubricated simultaneously with the start of the engine E by the hydraulic motor Mh, thereby preventing abnormal wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In each of the embodiments of the present invention, the working oil has been described as a working oil for bringing the hydraulic clutch of the transmission T into engagement, but may be considered as a lubricating oil for lubricating various portions of the transmission T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, in the preferred embodiments, the working oil is supplied to the transmission simultaneously with the start of the engine E, thereby enabling the prompt starting of the vehicle, while avoiding the shock by engagement of the hydraulic clutch, but the lubricating oil may be supplied to portions of the engine E, which are to be lubricated, simultaneously with the start of the engine, whereby the abnormal wearing of such portions to be lubricated can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the portion of the upstream section L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used as the portion of the downstream section L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but a portion of the downstream section L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the third oil passage L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be used as a portion of the downstream section L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second oil passage L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Even in the first to fourth embodiments, the original hydraulic pressure can be set to slightly exceed a necessary lowest hydraulic pressure, as in the fifth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the reservoir for the transmission T can also be used as the reservoir for the hydraulic pressure source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and hence, it is unnecessary to mount a separate reservoir in the hydraulic pressure source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which leads to a reduction in the number of parts. </paragraph>
