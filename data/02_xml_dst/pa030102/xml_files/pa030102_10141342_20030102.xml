<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Communication is performed for a first communication device having a set of antenna elements. A quality-indication signal is received from a second communication device (e.g., a basestation). A complex weighting is calculated based on the quality-indication signal. A pre-transmission signal is modified based on the complex weighting to produce a set of modified-pre-transmission signals. Each modified pre-transmission signal from the set of modified-pre-transmission signals is uniquely associated with an antenna element from the set of antenna elements. The set of modified-pre-transmission signals is sent from the set of antenna elements to produce a transmitted signal. The complex weighting is associated with a total power of the transmitted power and at least one from a phase rotation and a power ratio associated with each antenna element from the set of antenna elements. For example, in CDMA based systems, a fast feedback from the basestation&mdash;the power control indication&mdash;can be used by a subscriber communication device for this transmission diversity method in such a way that provides the desired signal quality at the basestation, without necessarily responding to fading nulls by mobile unit power output increase, but rather, by manipulating the weights of the mobile transmitter antenna array. Thus, a significant reduction in average and peak mobile power level is achieved, enhancing network capacity, battery life, and radiation hazards. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to communications and more particularly to a system and method for using a quality-indication signal added to a transmitted signal in a communication system, and used by the receiving end, in conjunction with multiple antenna elements. The receiver can use a separation process known as spatial filtering, or also referred to herein as smart antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Broadband networks having multiple information channels are subject to certain types of typical problems such as inter-channel interference, a limited bandwidth per information channel, inter-cell interference that limit the maximum number of serviceable users, and other interference. The usage of smart antenna techniques (e.g., using multiple antenna elements for a separation process known as spatial filtering), at both ends of the wireless communications channels, can enhance spectral efficiency, allowing for more users to be served simultaneously over a given frequency band </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Power-control signaling is another technique used to minimize inter-channel interference and increase network capacity. For example, mobile communication standards include a high rate, continuous, power-control signaling to ensure that mobile communication devices do not transmit too much or too little power. More specifically, based on the strength of the signal sent from the communication device and received at the basestation, the basestation sends a power-control signal to the mobile communication device indicating whether the communication device should increase or decrease the total power of its transmitted signal. The transmission rates for each value of the power-control signals are, for example, 1.25 ms for cdmaOne (IS-95)/CDMA2000, and 0.66 ms for WCDMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The known uses of power-control signaling have been limited only to adjusting the total power of the signal transmitted from the communication device. Next generation communication devices, however, can use multiple antenna elements (also referred to herein as a &ldquo;smart antenna&rdquo;) for a separation process known as spatial filtering. Thus, a need exists for an improved system and method that can combine the advantages of power-control signaling with the advantages of smart antennas. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A transmitted signal sent from a subscriber communication device to a second communication device (e.g., a basestation) can be weakened by time or by propagation-geometry-dependent fading and multipath. In other words, a signal sent from a subscriber communication device to a basestation will undergo destructive interference due to the fact that the transmitted signal propagates along different paths and reaches the basestation as a combination of the signals each having a different phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by controlling the phase of the transmitted signal at the subscriber communication device, the combination of signals received at the basestation can constructively interfere rather than destructively interfere, or alternatively reduce the intensity of the destructive interference. The phase of the transmitted signal can be controlled through the use of multiple antenna elements at the subscriber communication device. If the rate at which the transmitted signal is controlled exceeds the rate of fading, then the basestation will receive the transmitted signal at a relatively constant rate of power at a substantially optimized power. Because the rate of fading is relatively slow (e.g., between few Hz and a couple of hundred Hz) compared to the rate of power-control signaling in certain known communication protocols (e.g., around 1000 s of Hz), power-control signaling can be used to tune a smart antenna to substantially optimize the transmission of signals from a subscriber communication device to a basestation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The tuning of the subscriber communication device is done through the use of complex weighting. The signals associated with each antenna element from a set of multiple antenna elements can be adjusted based on the complex weighting. The term &ldquo;complex weighting&rdquo; relates to real and imaginary components of a signal, which can be varied to define the magnitude and phase of the signal. Because each of these signals can be adjusted differently, each signal is a low-correlation version of the pre-transmission signal upon which the transmitted signal is based. In other words, the signals associated with each antenna element can be adjusted separately from each other based on the complex weighting so that these signals are a low-correlation version of the pre-transmission signal. The complex weighting is calculated to adjust the total power of the transmitted signal and the phase rotation and/or power ratio associated with each antenna element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Note that term &ldquo;quality-indication signal&rdquo; is used herein to mean a signal having information about the quality of the communication link between a communication source sending the signal with multiple antenna elements and a communication device receiving the signal. For example, the quality-indication signal can be a power-control signal according to a code-division multiple access (CDMA) protocol. Such a CDMA protocol can be, for example, CDMA-IS-95 A/B, CDMA 2000 1X/RTT, CDMA 2000 3X, CDMA EV-DO, wideband CDMA (WCDMA), third-generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and fourth-generation (4G) UMTS. In fact, although the embodiments described herein are often in reference to such a power-control signal, any type of quality-indication signal in accordance with any type of communication protocol can be appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, although the embodiments described herein are in reference to a basestation sending a quality-indication signal to a subscriber communication device having multiple antenna elements, alternative embodiments are possible. For example, in alternative embodiments, a quality-indication signal can be sent from a subscriber communication device to a basestation having multiple antenna elements. Alternatively, a quality-indication signal can be sent from one communication device to another communication device having multiple antenna elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a system block diagram of a wireless communication network according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is coupled to basestation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which includes antenna <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is coupled to basestation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by, for example, a wireless communication link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, quality-indication based signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, radio subsystem <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, receive antenna <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, array of transmit antennas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and application subsystem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which handles the voice/data/display/keyboard, etc. The baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> comprises two main portions: a modulator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a demodulator <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. The radio subsystem <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> comprises two main portions: a receiver <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and a multi-channel transmitter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, quality-indication based signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the multi-channel transmitter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and transmit antenna array <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are portions of a transmitter for subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is the portion of the wireless communications system that receives a modulated received signal <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, demodulates it to produce demodulated received signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and to extract the quality indicator sent from the other side of the wireless link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Demodulated received signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is provided to application subsystem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The extracted quality indicator is fed into the quality-indication based signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> via quality-indication signal <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. Quality-indication based signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> modifies the pre-transmission signal <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in such a way that the other side of the wireless link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (e.g., basestation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), undergoes improved reception without necessarily increasing the combined power level transmitted from the subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Rather, by manipulating the weights of the various power amplifiers that feed their respective antenna elements in the array of transmit antennas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, better multipath behavior is achieved at the other side of the wireless link <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (e.g., at basestation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), as explained in further detail below. Said another way, application subsystem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> receives information for transmission such as, for example, data and/or voice information. Application subsystem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> sends an unmodulated transmission signal <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to modulator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Modulator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> modulates unmodulated transmission signal <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to produce pre-transmission signal <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, which is provided to quality-indication signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Quality-indication signal modifier calculates a complex weighting based on the quality-indication signal <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and modifies the pre-transmission signal to produce a plurality of modified pre-transmission signals <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Each modified pre-transmission signal is uniquely associated with an antenna element from the array of transmit antennas <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The modified pre-transmission signal <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is sent to multi-channel transmitter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, which forwards the modified pre-transmission signals <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to the array of transmit antennas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The array of transmit antennas <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> sends an effective combined transmitted signal based on the modified pre-transmission signal <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Note that the control logic <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> is different from the power control logic <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of the known subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The power control logic <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> merely provided power control information to power amplifier <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight>, whereas the control logic <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides complex weighting to both the vector modulator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> and the set of power amplifiers <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. This allows not only the total power of the transmitted signal to be adjusted based on the received power-control bit, but in addition, allows the phase rotation and/or the power ratio associated with each antenna element <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> to be adjusted based on the received power control information. Accordingly, this allows the transmitted signal to be optimal with respect to its reception by basestation <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Once this optimized signal is received by basestation <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, basestation <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can then send a power-control signal to subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> indicating that subscriber communication <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> should adjust the total power of its transmitted signal. Consequently, by optimizing the transmitted signal, the total power of the transmitted signal can be reduced, versus the case of a communication device with a single antenna, as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Such an optimization beneficially allows, for example, an increase in the battery lifetime of subscriber communication unit <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, an increase in the cellular system capacity of the communication network, and a decrease in the radiation hazard to the user of the subscriber communication unit <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Note that the D/A converters and radio subsystems are repeated for a number that corresponds to the number of antenna elements. In other words, if subscriber communication device has N number of antenna elements, then the subscriber communication device has N number of D/A converters and radio subsystems. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, D/A converter <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and radio subsystem <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are associated with one antenna element from a set of antenna elements (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>).

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The quality-indicator based signal modifier <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> receives an IF pre-transmission signal and power-control signal.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The complex weighting is calculated by determining the appropriate weighting value associated with the in-phase signal component and the quadrature signal component associated with each antenna element. For example, in the case where the phase rotation is being adjusted, the weighting value for the in-phase signal component will be different than the weighting value for the quadrature signal component. In the case where the power ratio is being adjusted, the weighting value for the in-phase signal component and the weighting value for the quadrature signal component are simultaneously increased or decreased for a given antenna element in parallel. Finally, in the case where the total power of the transmitted signal is being adjusted, the weighting value for the in-phase signal component and the weighting value for the quadrature signal component are simultaneously increased or decreased for all of the antenna elements in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> provides the complex weighting values to vector modulator <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>.

Vector modulator <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> splits the pre-transmission signal into a number of pre-transmission signals corresponding to the number of antenna elements. The vector modulator <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> then applies the complex weighting to the various pre-transmission signals so that each pre-transmission signal, which uniquely corresponds to an antenna element, modifies the respective pre-transmission signal based on the complex weighting values. The modified pre-transmission signals are then provided to D/A converters <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, which convert the pre-transmission signal from digital to analog form. Those pre-transmission signals are then provided to radio subsystems <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, respectively, which then convert the IF form of the pre-transmission signals into an RF form. These signals are then forwarded to power amplifiers and respective antenna elements (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Control logic <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> receives a power-control signal and produces complex weighting values, which are provided to vector modulator <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. Vector modulator <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> also receives a digital baseband in-phase pre-transmission signal and a digital baseband quadrature pre-transmission signal. Vector modulator <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> splits the in-phase and quadrature pre-transmission signal components into a number of signals that correspond to the number of antenna elements for the subscriber communication device. The complex weighting values are then applied to the in-phase and quadrature pre-transmission signal associated for each antenna element from the set of antenna elements for the subscriber communication device to produce modified pre-transmission signals. These modified pre-transmission signals are then provided to D/A converters <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>, which convert the digital form of the modified pre-transmission signals into analog form and forward these pre-transmission signals to combiners <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight>, respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for calculating the complex weighting by adjusting the phase rotation associated with each antenna element, according to an embodiment. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> will be described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for convenience, the method described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be used with any configuration of a subscriber communication device. In addition, although the quality-indication signal can be any appropriate type of signal that provides information to the subscriber communication device on the quality of the signal, for convenience of discussion, the quality-indication signal is assumed be to power-control signal according to the CDMA protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, a power-indication signal is sent from basestation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to subscriber communication device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via wireless connection <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, the power-control signal is sent from the baseband subsystem <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the quality-indicator based signal modifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (also shown as quality-indicator based signal modifier <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The power-control signal according to the CDMA protocol indicates one of two possible values for any given time period: an &ldquo;up&rdquo; value or a &ldquo;down&rdquo; value. An &ldquo;up&rdquo; value represents an indication from the basestation to the subscriber communication device that the subscriber communication device should increase the total power of its transmitted signal. A &ldquo;down&rdquo; value represents an indication from the basestation to the subscriber communication device that the subscriber communication device should decrease the total power of its transmitted signal. The particular value of the power-control signal is also referred to herein as including a power-control bit, which represents either the up or down values in binary form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, the process is held until the power-control signal reaches a steady state. The power-control signal can reach a steady state in a number of ways. For example, a consecutive sequence of power-control signals of up-down-up or down-up-down. Once the power-control signal reaches a steady state, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation associated with one antenna element is adjusted. Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> calculates a new complex weighting so that the phase rotation for one antenna element is changed. This complex weighting is provided to the signal adjusters for that antenna element (e.g., signal adjusters <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, or signal adjusters <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>). Upon receiving the complex weighting, these signal adjusters adjust the phase rotation thereby modifying the signal component sent from that antenna element and, consequently, modifying the total power of the transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>, the control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> determines whether the power-control signal for a subsequent time period indicates a decrease, e.g., represented by a down value. If the power-control signal indicates a decrease, then the adjustment to the phase rotation for the one antenna element resulted in the basestation receiving the transmitted signal more optimally. In other words, because the basestation received the transmitted signal with increased total power, the basestation will send a down indication in a subsequent power-control signal. The subscriber communication device can continue to attempt to optimize the phase rotation for that antenna element and simultaneously reduce the total power of the transmitted signal. The total power of the transmitted signal can be reduced because the subscriber communication device is communicating with the basestation in a more optimal manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>, if the power-control signal does not indicate a decrease for the total power of the transmitted signal (e.g., the power-control signal indicates an up value), then the phase rotation adjustment was not effective and the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>, logic control <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> changes the phase rotation associated with that antenna element to the opposite direction. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> where steps <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> are repeated based on the opposite direction for the phase rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>, if the power-control signal indicates a decrease for the total power of the transmitted signal (e.g., the power-control signal indicates a down value), then the phase rotation adjustment was effective and the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, the process is held until the power-control signal reaches a steady state. At step <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, logic control <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> changes the phase rotation associated with that antenna element to the same direction. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> where steps <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> are repeated based on the same direction for the phase rotation. </paragraph>

At step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, the process is held until the power-control signal reaches a steady state. Once the power-control signal reaches a steady state, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation associated with one antenna element is adjusted based of a new complex weighting calculated by control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, the control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> determines whether the power-control signal for a subsequent time period indicated a decrease for the total power of the transmitted power, e.g., represented by a down value. If the power-control signal indicates a decrease, then the adjustment to the phase rotation for the one antenna element resulted in the basestation receiving the transmitted signal more optimally. Consequently, the selected direction for the phase rotation is correct and further adjustments to the phase rotation in the same direction may result in a further optimized transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, if the power-control signal does not indicate a decrease for the total power of the transmitted signal (e.g., the power-control signal indicates an up value), then the phase rotation adjustment was not effective and the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, logic control <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> changes the phase rotation associated with that antenna element to the opposite direction. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> where steps <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> are repeated based on the opposite direction for the phase rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, logic control <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> changes the phase rotation associated with that antenna element in the same direction. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, the control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> determines whether the power-control signal for a subsequent time period indicated a decrease, e.g., represented by a down value. If the power-control signal indicates a decrease, then the adjustment to the phase rotation was effective and again process proceeds to <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> are repeated until the control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> determines that the power-control signal for a subsequent time period indicates an increase for the total power of the transmitted power. At this point, the optimum phase rotation can be obtained by taking the average of the phase rotations during step <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation for the antenna element is returned to the previous optimal phase rotation value. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> where the process is repeated for another antenna element. In this manner, the process can be repeated for each antenna element to obtain an overall optimum for the multiple antenna elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for calculating the complex weighting by adjusting the phase rotation associated with each antenna element, according to another embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> describes a method where the two most recently received values for the power-control bits are used to determine the proper phase rotation, and consequently, the proper complex weighting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the subscriber communication device using the CDMA protocol sends a signal of two adjacent power control groups (PCGs) in such a manner that the power associated with both PCGs are at the same level P. To simplify this discussion, assume for this embodiment that the subscriber communication device has two antenna elements, although any number of multiple antenna elements is possible. The phase rotation of the second antenna element relative to the first antenna element in the first PCG is Phi. The phase rotation of the second antenna element relative to the first antenna element in the second PCG is Phi&plus;Delta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The phase rotation offset (referred to as &ldquo;Delta&rdquo;) introduced between the first and second PCG provides a mechanism to determine the direction of the phase rotation between the two antenna elements that will improve the signal quality received at the basestation. Consequently, the complex weighting can be calculated by the following: if the value of the power-control bit for the most recent time period corresponds to the value of the power-control bit for the second most recent time period, the total power of the transmitted signal is adjusted while maintaining the phase rotation of the two antenna elements (i.e., maintaining Phi); if the value of the power-control bit for the most recent time period differs from the value of the power-control bit for the second time period, phase rotation of the two elements (i.e., Phi) is adjusted while maintaining the total power of the transmitted signal. The following more fully discusses this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, a phase rotation associated with one of the two antenna elements is initialized. At step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, phase rotation offset (also referred to above as Delta) is introduced for two adjacent PCGs. Based on this introduced phase rotation offset, a transmitted signal is sent from the subscriber communication device to the basestation. Then, the basestation sends a power-control signal based on this received transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the two most recently received values for the power-control bit are same. In other words, the power-control bit will have a particular value for each time period. For example, this time period for the CDMA and the WCDMA protocols is 1.25 msec and 666 &mgr;sec, respectively. The determination at step <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> compares the value for the power-control bit at the most recent time period to the value for the power-control bit at the second most recent time period. If the two values for the power-control bit correspond, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>. If the two values for the power-control bit differ, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>, the total power of the transmitted signal is adjusted while maintaining the phase rotation for the antenna element. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the total power of the transmitted signal and maintains the phase rotation for the two antenna elements by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> so that the process is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation for the two antenna elements is adjusted while maintaining total power of the transmitted signal. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the phase rotation for the antenna and maintains the total power of the transmitted signal by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> so that the process is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the two most recently received values for the power-control bits are used to determine the proper phase rotation, and consequently, a proper complex weighting. Although the total power of the transmitted signal is adjusted according to this embodiment, the power ratios of the respective antenna elements are not adjusted. The embodiments discussed below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> address the calculation of complex weighting so that the total power of the transmitted signal, the phase rotation and the power ratio of the antenna elements are adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for calculating the complex weighting by adjusting the power ratio and the phase rotation associated with each antenna element, according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, an element threshold detection is considered before adjusting any phase rotation or power ratio for the antenna elements. Again, to simplify this discussion, assume for this embodiment that the subscriber communication device has two antenna elements, although any number of multiple antenna elements is possible. By checking the ratio of the antenna elements, the basestation can provide feedback using the power-control bit of the power-control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> More specifically, based on the threshold values, the phase rotation can be adjusted to converge on a substantially optimal phase rotation value. Having determined the substantially optimal phase rotation value, the power ratio value for the antenna elements can be calculated until a substantially optimal power ratio value is converged upon. The process is iterative and can be interrupted at any time to change any parameter, such as the phase rotation or the power ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, the power ratio for the two antenna elements is measured. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the power ratio is below a predetermined threshold. If the power ratio is not below the predetermined threshold, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. If the power ratio is below the predetermined threshold, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> to tune the phase rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation is changed to find a maximum value. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation is checked to determine whether it is a substantially optimal value. If the phase rotation is not a substantially optimal value, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> where the process for finding a substantially optimal value of the phase rotation continues. If the phase rotation is a substantially optimal value, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>, the power ratio is changed to find a maximum value. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>, the power ratio is checked to determine whether it is a substantially optimal value. If the power ratio is not a substantially optimal value, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> where the process for finding a substantially optimal value of the power ratio continues. If the power ratio is a substantially optimal value, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, where the overall process repeats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In sum, the complex weighting can be calculated by adjusting the phase rotation associated with the antenna elements first, and then adjusting the power ratio associated with the antenna elements. In this manner, both the phase rotation and the power ratio can be adjusted to optimize substantially the transmitted signal sent from the subscriber communication device at received at the basestation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for calculating the complex weighting by adjusting the power ratio and the phase rotation associated with each antenna element, according to another embodiment of the invention. Similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> describes a method where the two most recently received values for the power-control bit are used to determine the proper phase rotation. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, however, the power ratio associated with the two antenna elements is adjusted after the phase rotation associated with the second antenna element is adjusted. The process of adjusting the power ratio is similar to that described above for adjusting the phase rotation in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the subscriber communication device using the CDMA protocol sends a signal of two adjacent power control groups (PCGs) in such a manner that the power associated with both PCGs are at the same level P. Again, to simplify this discussion, assume for this embodiment that the subscriber communication device has two antenna elements, although any number of multiple antenna elements is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The power ratio associated with the first PCG between the first antenna element and the second antenna element is Lambda. The power ratio associated with the second PCG between the first antenna element and the second antenna element is Lambda&plus;Zeta. The power ratio offset (i.e., Zeta) introduced between the first and second PCG provides a mechanism to determine the direction of changing power ration between the two antenna elements that will improve the signal quality received at the basestation. Consequently, the complex weighting can be calculated by the following: if the value of the power-control bit for the most recently received time period corresponds to the value of the power-control bit for the second most recently received time period, the total power of the transmitted signal is adjusted while maintaining the power ratio of the two antenna elements; if the value of the power-control bit for the most recently received time period differs from the value of the power-control bit for the second most recently received time period, power ratio Lambda is adjusting while maintaining the total power of the transmitted signal. The following more fully discusses this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, a phase rotation and a power ratio associated with one of the two antenna elements is initialized. At step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, phase rotation offset (also referred to above as Delta) is introduced for two adjacent PCGs. Based on this introduced phase rotation offset, a transmitted signal is sent from the subscriber communication device to the basestation. Then, the basestation sends a power-control signal based on this received transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the two most recently received values for the power-control bit are same. If the two values for the power-control bits correspond, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>. If the two values for the power-control bits differ, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>, the total power of the transmitted signal is adjusted while maintaining the phase rotation for the antenna element. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the total power of the transmitted signal and maintains the phase rotation for the two antenna elements by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. Note that during this step the power ratio for the two antenna elements are also maintained. Then, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> so that the process is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>, the phase rotation for the two antenna elements is adjusted while maintaining total power of the transmitted signal. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the phase rotation for the antenna and maintains the total power of the transmitted signal by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. Note that during this step the power ratio for the two antenna elements are also maintained. Then, the process proceeds to conditional step <highlight><bold>1345</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> At conditional step <highlight><bold>1345</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the adjusted phase rotation produced by step <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> is optimal. If the phase rotation is less than substantially optimal, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>. If the phase rotation is substantially optimal, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, power ratio offset (also referred to above as Zeta) is introduced for two adjacent PCGs. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the two most recently received values for the power-control bit correspond. If the two most recently received values for the power-control bit correspond, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1380</bold></highlight>. If the two most recently received values for the power-control bit differ, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1370</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1370</bold></highlight>, the power ratio for the antenna element is adjusted while maintaining total power of the transmitted signal and maintaining the phase rotation for the two antenna elements. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the power ratio for the antenna and maintains the total power of the transmitted signal and the phase rotation for two antenna elements by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. The process then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> so that steps <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight> are repeated until the two values for the most recently received values for the power-control bit correspond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1380</bold></highlight>, the power of the transmitted signal is adjusted while maintaining the power ratio and the phase rotation for the antenna element. Control logic <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> adjusts the total power of the transmitted signal and maintains the power ratio and the phase rotation for the antenna element by appropriately calculating new complex weighting. At conditional step <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether the track is lost. If the track is not lost, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> so that the process of tuning the power ratio associated with the antenna element and the total power of the transmitted signal are repeated in steps <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Returning to conditional step <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>, if the track is lost, then the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> where the process of optimizing the phase rotation and then the power ratio is repeated in steps <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
