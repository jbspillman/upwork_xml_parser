<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The consequences of any failure of a blow out preventer assembly to operate correctly in an emergency can be far reaching. Thus, there is provided an apparatus for registering parameters in the bore of a member which is, in use, connected to a pressurised housing, the apparatus comprising: an electro-control package for attachment, in use, to the member; a test assembly placed, in use, in the member; the electro-control package and the test assembly having means for sending signals to and receiving signals from one another. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a testing apparatus to test a Blow Out Preventer (BOP) stack or assembly and to a method of testing using such an apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A BOP assembly is a multi closure safety device which is connected to the top of a drilled and often partially cased hole. The accessible top end of the casing is terminated using a casing spool or wellhead housing upon which the BOP assembly is connected and sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The wellhead and BOP stack (the section in which rams are provided) must be able to contain fluids at a pressure rating in excess of any formation pressures that are anticipated when drilling or when having to pump into the well to suppress or circulate an uncontrolled pressurised influx of formation fluid. This influx of formation fluid is known as a &lsquo;kick&rsquo; and restabilising control of the well by pumping to suppress the influx or to circulate the influx out under pressure is known as &lsquo;killing the well&rsquo;. An uncontrolled escape of fluid, whether liquid or gas, to the environment is termed a &lsquo;blow out&rsquo;. A blow out can result in a major leak to the environment which can ignite or explode, jeopardising personnel and equipment in the vicinity, and pollution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although normal drilling practices provide a liquid hydrostatic pressure barrier to a kick, a final second mechanical safety barrier is provided by the BOP assembly. The BOP, assembly must close and seal on tubular equipment hung or operated through the BOP assembly and ultimately must be capable of shearing and sealing off the well. Wells are typically drilled using a tapered drill string having successively larger diameter tubulars at the lower end. When running a completion or carrying out a workover various diameter of tubulars, coiled tubing, cable and wireline and an assortment of tools are run. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The consequences of any failure of the BOP assembly multi closure barriers and valves, shear and seal devices to correctly operate in an emergency can be far reaching. It is essential to initially contain the kick to prevent a blow out and then be capable of killing the well, and re-establishing control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To verify the functions and performance of a BOP assembly, stringent tests have to be performed on a regular bases, either daily, weekly or at certain stages of the drilling operation to ensure the BOP is in full working order. When drilling or carrying out well intervention on a subsea well where the wellhead is at the seabed, the subsea BOP attached to the subsea wellhead is connected to a buoyant floating drilling vessel by a riser. A floating drilling vessel should maintain its station vertically above the well to enable well operations to be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Failure to do so caused by weather conditions, current forces, equipment malfunctions, drift off or drive off, fire or explosion, collision or other marine incidents means it is necessary if possible to make the well safe, isolate the well at the seabed and disconnect the riser system. In a severe emergency, shearing any tubulars or equipment in the BOP bore, sealing the well to full working pressure and disconnecting the riser system is required to be achieved in under 30 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A conventional BOP assembly, surface or subsea, is attached to a wellhead and is provided with a number of ram BOPs to either seal around different set tubular diameters or to shear and seal the bore. These ram BOPs should be rated to perform at pressures in excess of any anticipated well pressures or kick control injection pressures being approximately 10 to 15 kpsi (69-103 MPa). A minimum of one annular BOP is provided above the ram BOPs to cater for any tubular diameter or for stripping in or out under pressure. An annular BOP is a hydraulically energised elastomeric toroidal unit that closes and seals on varying diameters of tubular member whether stationary or moving into or out of the well. Due to the nature of this pressure barrier element, a lower maximum rated working pressure of about 5 kpsi (34 MPa) is normally available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Above the annulars, there are no further well pressure barrier elements with the riser only providing a hydrostatic head, liquid containment and guidance of equipment on a normal pressure controlled drilling operation. For a subsea riser system, the hydrostatic head of the different drilling liquids over the ambient sea water pressure means the low pressure zone above the subsea BOP assembly must still withstand, depending upon the depth of water, 5 kpsi (34 MPa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The conventional BOP assembly in effect provides a three zone pressure containment safety system. The three zones typically consists of the first high pressure lowermost section encompassing the rams, the medium pressure second zone, the annular or annulars and the low pressure third zone being the bore above to atmosphere and on a subsea system the riser bore to the surface vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore important to be aware that BOP assemblies need to be tested rigorously in order to verify their full working order and that any potential problems can be identified and rectified before any emergency arises in order to maintain the integrity of a BOP assembly once it is in place. In deep water, BOP assemblies could remain subsea for several months. It is necessary for it to be fully tested at regular intervals and, throughout the subsea industry, this is typically at least once every week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is important therefore that the tests on the BOP assembly are carried out carefully and methodically to detect any potential problems but in a reasonable time to minimise risk exposure as testing prevents further downhole well operations especially if the well is open being partially drilled or when involved in a completion or work over. In the case of subsea wellheads which can be at a water depth of as much as 10,000 feet (3050 m), it typically takes approximately three to four hours plus to run the test apparatus into place and three to four hours plus to pull back to the surface after testing has been completed. A typical test sequence takes approximately 6 hours plus to complete if there are no queries or questionable readings. Thus, it is not unusual for a well to be out of operation for approximately 12 hours per week. This is clearly very significant in terms of risk exposure and lost revenue for the well owners and anything which can reduce the well downtime is therefore of great benefit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Diagnosing any queries or questionable readings can take time even on an integral system, the variety being due to fluid compression, thermal changes of the fluids or to the equipment containing the fluids, riser/vessel movement and the large volumes in the choke and kill lines to the surface in comparison to the relatively small volumes of the BOP cavities and that of a small leak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A faulty diagnosis or incorrect interpretation due to vague information could lead to the well being temporarily suspended and the BOP assembly being pulled. In deepwater it could take 6 days plus before well operations are resumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is normal procedures when testing the BOP assembly to use a drill pipe or a test mandrel connected above a wellhead tool that will seal within the wellhead. It is also known to try to combine some of the BOP assembly tests with wellhead and surface manifold testing. When testing the BOP assembly it is necessary to ensure that all of the valves, seals, rams and annulars are tested to their maximum expected usage pressure. Each pressure test should be started by a minimum 5 minute low pressure test (e.g. at 300 psi) and then raised in increments to the final high test pressure. Typically, a wellhead/BOP test pressure that is stable and recorded for a minimum of 5 minutes is considered satisfactory. BOP rams are only designed to seal off pressure from below which means all tests have to be carried out either against the wellhead test tool or the well bore. The usual practice is to supply the test pressure to the BOP cavity under test alternating between the choke and kill lines to allow all functions on each side of the BOP stack to be tested from the bore outwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When testing the BOP assembly cavities around the test tubular, the BOP test pressures at certain stages of the well could exceed the pressure rating of the well casing so far installed. If a leak occurred from the BOP bore test past the wellhead test tool, the well could be pressured up and be hydraulically fractured, thus making the well unusable. To prevent this occurring the well fluid is allowed to vent up the bore of the wellhead test tool into the bore of the drill pipe where any leak can be monitored on the surface. One particular and critical test is the integrity of the shear blind ram BOP cavity. The shear blind rams are those which can cut the drill string or a pipe or tubing and then seal the BOP bore when there is a need to carry out an emergency disconnect of the riser system from the BOP stack. This, in effect, is the last and only resort for shutting down the well as when the pipe rams are closed on a tubular, the bore of the tubular is still open. Typically, the testing of the shear blind rams requires disconnecting the drill pipe or part of the test mandrel below the shear blind rams and pulling the upper part clear such that the shear blind rams can close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, after the mechanical release from the lower part of the test mandrel attached to a wellhead test tool the bore through the remaining test equipment into the wellhead must be isolated to test up under the shear blind rams. This can be achieved by using either a one way flow mechanism which has the possibility to weep or leak, pressuring up the well casing or alternatively by tripping out of the hole and running a solid wellhead test tool. Either way, after the mechanical release or if a solid wellhead test tool is run, the integrity of the wellhead test tool to seal off in the wellhead cannot be verified before tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Even though the shear blind ram BOP cavity is a critical zone to test, the consequences of jeopardising the integrity of the well casing is deemed too high a risk. Therefore, it is normal practice to test the shear blind ram BOP cavity only to the operationally safe allowable low casing working pressure using either no wellhead test tool or a test tool knowing that, if it leaked, no well damage can occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the test liquid pumped and measured on the vessel is supplied at the test pressure typically through either the choke or kill lines down to the appropriate test path into the subsea BOP bore. In addition, this conventional test procedure using the choke and kill lines involves a high volume relative to the small tested cavity volume above the wellhead test tool and in relation to any leaks, meaning that it is difficult to detect leaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To reduce premature damage to equipment and function elements, the operation and resetting of the BOP barriers means the valves, rams and annulars should only be opened or closed in a depressurised bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the choke and kill lines must be vented down between each cavity test, i.e. they are depressurised and repressurised with tests only commencing after the pressure has balanced and stabilised. This is a time consuming process which greatly lengthens the testing time. The compressibility of the drilling liquids, usually drilling mud, and possible expansion or elongation of the lines to the BOP and variations in temperature all contribute to the difficulty of monitoring very small changes in the volume. A wise practice is to circulate the system with seawater which can reduce these effects but not eliminate them entirely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Once a stable test pressure is achieved, the current BOP testing technique is to surface monitor the test pressure and establish a decay profile. However, when testing, there is a degree of interpretation required as to whether the decays are caused by the above mentioned side effects or a leak. This interpretation has to be carried out by personnel at the surface of the well and is based on experience and judgement rather than facts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When drilling a well, the prime barrier to prevent an influx of formation fluid is provided by the hydrostatic head of the drilling mud column. It is essential that the consistency and properties of the drilling mud are as specified for certain sections of open hole. This is achieved by circulating a constantly surface trimmed liquid at a designated rate in relation to the liquid properties. In addition, any traces of an influx can be detected by the, surface monitoring systems on the return line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A stationary column of well liquid could unknowingly allow migration of formation fluid into the well bore and the properties of the well liquid could change due to deterioration, thus creating an unstable situation which could result in a kick. Therefore, allowing an open hole to stand stationary for any period of time is an unwise practice. Also, if a kick occurs, the optimum solution is to circulate the kick out under pressure which involves having a tubular member in the hole below the influx and preferably near the bottom of the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when having to test a BOP on a well with a balanced open hole, it is a wise practice to use part of the drilling string hung-off below the wellhead test tool. This means that after completing the BOP testing, the well fluids can be circulated and conditioned prior to opening the BOP and pulling the string up to remove the test tools. If a kick has occurred or occurs while pulling out of the riser, the BOP rams can be closed on the drill string and the well circulated. This cannot be achieved if there is a one-way upward flow mechanism in the wellhead test tool or a solid wellhead test plug has been used which would prevent circulation, endangering the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,976 discloses a means of testing the shear blind rams of a BOP by splitting the tool into upper and lower portions. In order to test the rams, the upper portion of the tool is removed, the rams tested, and the tool reconnected before withdrawing the tool from the BOP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,736 (Nutec) discloses a test mandrel for use in subsea testing of BOPs which allows the BOP test fluid to be pumped down the drill pipe to a telescopic arrangement. However, this has inherent problems due to possible leakage between the seals of the telescopic portions which makes it very difficult to distinguish a failed BOP. Accounting for the different heights of the wellhead test plug at different stages of the well is accounted for by using spacer pipes between the wellhead test plug and the telescopic test tool. Circulation of the well after testing is not possible unless wireline is run down the drill pipe to remove the blanking dart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also monitoring for leaks from around the wellhead test tool is via the test assembly into the drilling riser which has an immense volume in deep water. A means of testing the shear blind rams is not discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> SUT Paper (Society of Underwater Technology, UK)&mdash;&ldquo;Acoustic BOP Test Tool&rdquo; provides additional screwed sections of pipe which can be added to the drill pipe or test WI mandrel such that the tubular section can be set at the right height in the BOP stack for the different drilling phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This would also cater for the use of different wellhead test tools and to land in the wellhead at the different landing shoulders provided by the different casing hangers/seal assemblies as the well is drilled. The height of the tubular test assembly can be changed to meet the BOP space out. An acoustic pressure emitter can be included in the lower part of the test mandrel which transmits the pressure readings up the drill pipe to the surface. A mechanical communication path is required between the emitter and the surface. Again, circulation of the well and testing of the shear blind rams has not been discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This description has mainly addressed the testing of BOP assemblies as multi-closure safety devices as a barrier in the drilling mode. Similar criteria applies when the BOP assembly is used when installing a completion in combination with a completion riser which means the BOP assembly is a critical high pressure isolation mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This invention is a system and technique which can accurately quantify tests and improve testing practices, jointly raising the level of safety and the commercial aspect of the well operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for registering parameters in the bore of a member which is, in use, connected to a pressurised housing, the apparatus comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> an electro-control package for attachment, in use, to the member; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> the test assembly placed, in use, in the member; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the electro-control package and the test assembly having means for sending signals to and receiving signals from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the test assembly is one of the following: blow out preventer test assembly, wellhead tubing hanger running tool, spool tree or horizontal tree tubing hanger running and test tool, casing and seal assembly running tool, subsea test tree, wireline or coil tubing tool, hanger or plugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for testing closure elements in a blow out preventer (BOP) forming a BOP assembly which is, in use, connected to a wellhead, the apparatus comprising a shearable test tool assembly for use in combination with the BOP assembly and the wellhead; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> an electro-control package for attachment, in use, to the BOP; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> the test tool assembly and the control package having means for sending signals and receiving signals from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the electro-control package is replaceable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the means for transmitting and receiving signals includes a plurality of emitters and transceivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the emitters and/or transceivers use one of optical, electrical, electromagnetic, radio, hydraulic pulses or acoustic means as input and output for communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The test tool assembly may have sensing means for monitoring parameters inside and outside the tool bore, and for both above and below the tool. These parameters may include at least one of the following: pressure, temperature, velocity, density, and phase detection. The phase detection is preferably one of the following: drilling mud, cement, gas, oil, water and completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the control package has independent sensing means for monitoring the parameters in a BOP bore above the wellhead. Furthermore, the control package may have means for sending signals to and receiving signals from a control station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The test assembly preferably includes at least one annular and at least one set of rams for sealing the bore of the member to create a test chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In general, and especially when using subsea applications, the test tool is preferably connected to the surface only by means of a mandrel which may be split into upper and lower sections that are run on drill pipe or tubulars from the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> One difference between the present invention and conventional BOP testing means is that the apparatus of the present invention preferably lands in a specific location in the wellhead. Thus, instead of landing on components in the wellhead which vary with height as the well is drilled, a datum height is always used, ensuring that the assembly of the present invention is at a constant attitude within the BOP.- Preferably, the assembly is landed on the wellhead internal lock and seal profiles for the wellhead running tool. If the wellhead components, which vary with height need to be tested, specific nose adapters may be fitted to the test tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If no specific landing shoulder or stop is available in the wellhead body, then the specific nose adapters or nose spacers landed on the respective wellhead component can ensure the apparatus is landed at a specific elevation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By using a datum level which may be a slight reduction in the internal diameter of the wellhead housing, and therefore a known landing site, a datum anti torque resistance is registered when the test tool is located in the wellhead. Preferably, left hand rotation is used to lock the test tool into the wellhead and preferably high torque right hand rotation is available to release the test tool, without the risk of unscrewing the drill pipe. In this arrangement, left hand rotation preferably drives a cam in the test tool to energise locking dogs which lift the tool off the datum ledge and into the specific internal load bearing profile. This ensures that there is no deformation of the indicator profile on the datum ledge when the test tool is subjected to high pressure loads. In this way, the tool is sealed to the wellhead and the conventional annulus flow through path through the body of the tool is also sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Typically, there is a hanging drill string below the test tool assembly and, in order to prevent this drill string having to be rotated and, thus, causing resistance, a pressure sealing swivel may be incorporated into the lower end of the test tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A test tool intelligent monitoring unit may be incorporated within the test tool, the monitoring unit can check data within the bore of the tool, and external to the bore, and both above and below the tool. In this way, pressure and temperature can easily be registered. Alternatively density phase sensors, flow meters, the rotation, tension and torque in the mandrel can also be monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The electrical control package is preferably mounted on the BOP below the lower ram on a spare choke/kill outlet. The control package preferably includes actuated fluid control valves and chokes which provide double barrier fail closed isolation, fluid flow meters and, when a high pressure control line cannot be provided, a fluid intensifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Via the intelligent monitoring unit and the control package, surface personnel can readily monitor read/hear functions occurring at the wellhead and verify that the device is operating correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The test tool may also comprise a one way upward flow valve located in the bore, the one way upward flow valve allowing fluid to escape from below the test tool. This flow path ensures that the well casing cannot be pressured up if there is a leak from the BOP bore past the test tool. The one way upward flow valve preferably comprises parallel seals which prevent the flow from cutting the seals or the sealing area. It is essential that this one way upward flow valve is reliable as, when the mandrels are separated in order to test the shear/blind rams, full test pressure will be exerted down the bore to the top of the one way upward flow valve. This full test pressure must not be allowed to enter the bore as this will pressure up the well and may damage the well casings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the test mandrel is split into upper and lower portions, joined by a mandrel coupling. Preferably, a hydraulic operated anti left hand rotation mechanism is incorporated into this coupling such that, when pressure is applied down the drill pipe against the one way upward flow valve, the anti left hand rotation mechanism is released, preferably by energising a spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A bladder arrangement may be provided to prevent drilling mud clogging the mechanism. The bladder arrangement separates the hydraulic fluid from any drilling mud or sea water. Preferably, the mechanism is low torque,- such that the tool can be unlocked without any vertical separation of the upper and lower mandrels. A conventional screw thread would lock up under either the weight or tension caused when operating from a heaving vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> During operation, the coupling system will lock out, thus preventing further rotation. This can be registered on the surface and the low pressure in the drill pipe can be vented down. Then, the drill pipe/upper mandrel can be pulled up, separating the coupler without dislodging the test tool which is locked and sealed in the wellhead. This allows the shear blind ram cavity to be fully tested to the maximum anticipated well pressure against the test tool, which has its bore isolated by the one way upward flow valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Pressure read outs can be taken from the BOP bore and from below the test tool to confirm any well casing is not being pressured up. When testing the shear blind rams, it is preferable that the upper mandrel is pulled up against, and sealed by, an upper annular prior to closing the shear blind rams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Even if a pressure drop is noted, this does not specifically identify the location of the leak. The present invention permits separate and simultaneous monitoring of fluid flow on the choke and kill lines, the riser, booster line and through the drill pipe/upper mandrel, in particular to monitor any escape of fluid from the test chamber. After a successful test of the shear blind rams, the upper mandrel is preferably lowered and stabbed together, engaging and intermeshing anti rotation features on the couplings and these may be key slots on both couplings. With downward weight binding the test tool, right hand rotation will drive the mandrel coupling cam mechanism to lock the upper coupling to the lower coupling. The anti left rotation locks are in effective to right hand rotation. Again, when fully locked, a build up of torque will be seen at the surface and upward pull against the locked test tool verifies full load carrying make up is achieved. At this point, any sea water in the kill line, BOP, choke line and booster line should be replaced by drilling mud. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the arrangement where the bore protector or wear bushing is to be left in place, it is preferred that the pressuring up of the drill pipe releases the wear bushing. By picking up the total drill string hanging weight, right hand rotation will open up the annulus flow through path, unseal and unlock the test tool. With pressure held on the drill pipe, the test tool can be pulled clear of the wear bushing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The apparatus preferably includes a drop dart which can be released down the drill pipe to land and seal in the circulation sleeve of the test tool, in order that the well can be circulated prior to pulling the tool out of the hole. A hydraulic lock is formed between the dart and the circulation sleeve and the one way upward flow valve and therefore no circulation would occur. To overcome this, the circulation sleeve has a dual flow design which is activated by the dart depressing a spring loaded plunger in the circulation sleeve, thus venting fluid below the dart into a circulation port exiting below the tool. Pressure can now be applied down the drill pipe to allow the dart/sleeve to move down, thus opening a circulation path from the bore above the test tool to the bore below. The circulation port bypass the one way upward flow valve and neutralise the wear bushing hydraulically operated latch dogs. The BOP control package can verify the bore pressures and circulation pressures. In this way, the well can be circulated and, as the test tool is pulled out, fluid will equalise down the drill pipe, thus allowing a dry string to be pulled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the situation when premature well circulation has to be carried out, wire line or coil tubing can be run to retrieve the dart. As the dart is pulled, sealed friction or spring friction contacts will pull the circulation sleeve up into the closed position, thus returning the test tool to the test mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A further application of the apparatus of the present invention is as an emergency planned hang off tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additionally, if a bad weather forecast is received when drilling the well, and a decision is made to suspend operations, the drill string can be pulled up to the last casing shoe, plus the water depth. The test assembly with a one way downward flow mechanism is inserted and locked in the bore between the test plug and the mandrel before being connected to the drill pipe and run down to the wellhead where the test tool assembly can then be locked and sealed to the wellhead. The surface installed one way downward flow mechanism unit will, on a surface installation, depress the plunger and move the circulation sleeve into the open position. This will allow a downward circulation through the bore but will isolate any pressure in the bore below the test assembly. The test tool will provide the bore upward barrier and an annulus barrier, which closes the well flow through path, prior to disconnecting the mandrel coupling and closing the shear blind rams. This arrangement thus provides independent mechanical double barrier isolation of the well, first in the wellhead and then by the BOP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When returning after a disconnection of the BOP and riser, the internal pressure conditions of the BOP can be monitored prior to opening any barriers, due to the electro-control package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The electro-control package may inject fluid into, or vent fluid from, the BOP bore at a known pressure and volume, preferably at the required test pressure. This allows simultaneous testing of the ram or annular barrier, the choke side and the kill side of the BOP bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the present invention can be used to carry out a full test procedure on the BOP and the wellhead and it permits the number of steps to be reduced thus ensuring the well down time is reduced and the cost effectiveness of any installation is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the BOP allows the blind shear rams to be tested which, as referred to above, although vital, is often or even usually not carried out to the full working pressure. The testing procedure is carried out once the test assembly has landed at its datum height at the top of the wellhead housing. The test procedure should follow the operator&apos;s programme.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> One of a number of conventional subsea BOP well assemblies <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A wellhead <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed at the upper end of a bore into the sea bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is provided with a wellhead housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The BOP assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is, in this example, comprised of a BOP Lower Riser Package (LRP) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a BOP stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.. The LRP and the BOP stack are connected in such a way that there is a continuous bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the lower end of the lower part through to the upper end of the upper part of the BOP assembly. The lower end of the BOP stack is connected to the upper end of the wellhead housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is sealed in placed. The upper end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the LRP is connected to the riser pipe <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and connects the BOP assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a surface structure (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Within the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and riser pipe <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a drill pipe or a tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided and this is connected, at its lower end, to a test tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The test tool is landed on the internal wellhead components and seals to the wellhead housing. At the lower end of the test tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a further tubular <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided and extends into the bore beneath the sea bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Wear bushing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and various well casings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> have previously been set in the wellhead housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The BOP stack is provided with a number of valve means for closing both the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and/or the tubular <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and these include lower pipe rams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, middle pipe rams <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, upper pipe rams <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. These four sets of rams comprise the high pressure zone in the BOP stack and they can withstand the greatest pressure. The lower, middle and upper pipe rams are designed such that they close around the drill pipe or tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Of course, when the lower, middle and upper pipe rams are closed, whilst the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is sealed, the bore of the tubular <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> itself is still open. Thus, the shear blind rams are designed such that, when operated, they can cut through any tubular or drill pipe which may be in the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and provide a single barrier between the upwardly pressurised drilling fluid and the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the medium pressure zone, above the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, lower annular <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and upper annular <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are provided and these annulars also seal around the drill pipe or tubular member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when they are closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The low pressure zone is located above the upper annular <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and includes the flex joint <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the riser <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The pressure containing means in this zone is merely the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid which is retained in the bore open to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Extending from the sea surface to the BOP assembly are choke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, kill <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and booster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> lines for the supply of fluid to or from the BOP stack. The booster line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via a booster line valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and enters the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> above the flex joint <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The choke line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in three locations, each location having an individual branch which is controlled by a pair of valves. The uppermost valves are inner <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and outer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> gas vents and the branch on which they are located extends into the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> below the upper annular <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The choke line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends, past the inner and outer gas vents, through a choke test valve <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and enters the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via upper, inner <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and outer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> choke valves above the middle pipe rams <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and via lower, inner <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and outer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> choke valves below the lower pipe rams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> On the opposite side of the BOP stack, the kill line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is equipped with a kill test valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> before the kill line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> enters the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at two locations, again each of which is via a pair of valves; upper, inner <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and outer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> kill valves and lower, inner <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and outer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> kill valves respectively. The upper branch is between the upper pipe rams <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the lower branch is between the lower <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and middle pipe <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> summary of the full test requirements of a conventional subsea BOP can be seen and it is clear that at least <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> steps are required to test the conventional arrangement. This can be compared with the suggested test schedule associated with the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> wellhead test tool assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown and is comprised of an upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The upper and lower mandrels are connected by means of a mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>- is connected, at its upper end, to drill pipe <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected, at its lower end, to a wellhead test plug-<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> has, on its outer diameter, an annular return swedge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and has a number of cams (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) which, when operated by right hand rotation of the upper mandrel, engage with dogs <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to lock the upper and lower mandrel together. Seals <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are provided to ensure a fluid tight connection. The mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is also provided with hydraulic means <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for overriding the anti left hand rotation of the coupling. The lower section of the upper mandrel has a narrowed portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which is, in use, at the same level as the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to facilitate emergency shearing of the upper mandrel if necessary during an emergency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a number of sensors for monitoring the pressure within various parts of the test plug and these include a BOP bore pressure sensor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a lower pipe annulus pressure sensor or wellhead/pipe chamber sensor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, a drill pipe pressure sensor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a lower pipe bore pressure sensor <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which measures the pressure in bypass passage <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and below the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Seals <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> ensure a fluid tight seal between the wellhead test plug and the wellhead. The test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with cams, (not shown) which, when operated, lock a number of dogs <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> such that the test plug is securely connected to the wellhead shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When open, a passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is provided as a bypass for the wellhead seal. A second passageway <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, also valved, is provided as a further bypass of the test tool. A signal receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and associated electrical source <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, which may be a battery, relay the measured pressure from sensors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to the control package and/or to a surface control station. The function and operation of circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and one way upward flow valve <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is discussed with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of the BOP assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the wellhead test tool assembly when in place and carrying out a test on the lower pipe ram <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and provided through a port below the lower pipe rams is an electro control package <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the details of which will be described more fully with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. When the lower pipe rams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are in the closed position and the lower inner choke valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the flow port valve <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and the wellhead seal bypass port <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are in the closed position, a chamber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is formed and the pressure within this chamber can be monitored by means of BOP bore pressure sensor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and by additional pressure sensors in the control package <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The pressure and flow within the choke line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also monitored to check the integrity of the lower inner choke valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A more detailed cross section of the wellhead test plug is shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In particular, the pressure sensors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the data-signal receiver/transmitter <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and associated electrical source <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are located at the upper end of the test plug. The data signal receiver/transmitter is used to send and receive signals to and from the control package <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and/or a control station on the sea surface. The circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is shown in its upper, flow preventing position. When the sleeve is actuated to its lower position, it permits bypass flow passed the high pressure check valve <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with bore pressure hydraulic retract wear bushing latch dogs <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which, when the drill pipe is pressured up, release the wear bushing. The one way upward flow valve <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is spring energised closed. A loaded plunger <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is activated by a dropped dart <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which depresses the plunger in the circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which then allows fluid to be vented from below the dart into a circulation port which exits below the tool and prevents a hydraulic lock. This then ensures that pressure can be applied down the drill pipe to allow the circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the dart <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to move down and open a circulation path from the bore above the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the bore below. At the lower end of the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a pressure sealing swivel <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is incorporated to prevent any hanging drill string having to be rotated with the test tool. Preferably, a left hand thread <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> ensures that it is left hand rotation which locks the test tool into the wellhead by driving a cam <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> which energises locking dogs <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which move the test tool off the datum ledge <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and into engagement with the specific internal load bearing profile <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the wellhead. A number of seals <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are provided to ensure the correct fluid tight seals are provided between the tool and the wellhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in situ in a wellhead housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and having a hanger test plug <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> attached at its lower end and acting as a nose adaptor on the swivel joint <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> providing engagement with a casing hanger <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Various adaptors can be used, dependent upon the object which is to be run below the test tool. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also indicates how the dogs <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> engage with the wellhead housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the load bearing profile <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> rather than at the datum level <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. To test the casing hanger seal assembly or the lower pipe annulus, the bypass plug <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> must be removed, preferably at surface level, to provide a test fluid communication path through the port <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the wellhead chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> indicates how the test tool can be used to run or pull a wear bushing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as part of the test assembly. To carry out this function, no additional nose attachment is required on the test tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows, in detail, the construction of the mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> which joins the upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are located adjacent to and above the mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The coupling is provided with a hydraulically operated anti left hand rotation mechanism which, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> which permits right hand rotation but prevents left hand rotation of the upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> relative to the lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. When pressure is applied down the drill pipe into the upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> the anti left hand rotation -mechanism <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is released as the pressure in oil chamber <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> increases. The oil chamber can be serviced on the surface by filing and venting through respective ports <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. A left hand thread <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> drives a cam <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which activates a lock ring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to engage the upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The release of this left hand thread is only permitted by actuation of the anti left hand rotation mechanism <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> more detailed view of the drop dart circulation unit in the test tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is shown. The dart <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is allowed to drop down the drill pipe and will land and seal in the circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> thus activating a spring loaded plunger <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> which then vents fluid through passageway <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from below the dart/sleeve into the circulation port <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> below the tool. The depression of the plunger can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> which also shows how the vent ports <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> open to the plunger <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows how the application of further pressure forces the circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be moved such that the circulation ports <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are aligned, thereby allowing fluid to bypass the one way upward flow valve <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and to neutralise the wear bushing hydraulically operated latch dogs. Thus, the well can now be circulated prior to the test tool being tripped out and, as fluid will equalise down the drill pipe, a dry string can be pulled. </paragraph>

It will be noted how the mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> has been released such that the upper mandrel <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is drawn up thus leaving only the lower mandrel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> beneath the shear blind rams which have been closed. By closing at least one of the upper and lower choke valves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and at least one of the upper and lower kill valves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the valve into the control package <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed and can be pressured up to the maximum anticipated well pressure. In this way, the integrity of the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be verified in a simple and quick manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows, in detail, a fully encompassing control package <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. A minimum unit could consist of a signal receiver and transmitter unit combined with an electric or hydraulic operated fail closed prime master valve and secondary master valve with a high pressure line for pressuring up and venting down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment consists of a data signal receiver and transmitter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> to communicate with the bore <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the BOP.

A controlled failed closed isolation valve <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, an adjustable choke <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a volume flow meter <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> allow pressurised flow through a one way flow mechanism <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> into the common two way flow path <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The vent or the return path <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> from the common two way flow passes through controlled fail closed choke <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and isolation valves <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> which regulate the release of fluid into a vent return line <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. This vent line can be connected to the riser bore <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> An electrical or electric hydraulic means of operating the functions in the control package is provided through a control processor <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This control package provides a controlled fluid flow with feedback for accurately pressuring up and venting down as required for testing the BOP and wellhead systems, while at the same time, it will fail close if a loss of control is experienced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Based on the BOP configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an example of the procedure for fully testing the BOP shown is as follows and is summarised in the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (i) The initial simultaneous tests are carried out to check the integrity of: the choke line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the choke test valve <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (choke line side&mdash;CLS) and the outer gas vent valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (CLS); the kill line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the kill test valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (kill line side&mdash;KLS); and the booster line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the booster line valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (booster line side (BLS). The pressure is monitored in each of the choke, kill and booster lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (ii) The second simultaneous tests are concerned with the integrity of the upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valves (CLS), the inner gas vent valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (CLS) and the LRP (Lower Rise Package)-BOP choke line connection, and with the upper <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> outer kill valves (KLS) and the LRP/BOP kill line connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (iii) The next step simultaneously tests the upper <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inner choke valves (CLS) and the upper <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> inner kill valves (KLS). These tests will check the choke, kill and booster lines and the associated valving from the line side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Tests using the assembly can be as follows with certain valves not under test being set to enable any leaks to be monitored independently up either the riser or the choke or kill lines: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (iv) The seal between the test tool and the well head is tested together with the lower pipe rams <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the lower inner choke valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (well side&mdash;WS), the well head connector and the control package prime master <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The inner gas vent <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the upper <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> inner kill valves and the upper inner choke valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are all in a closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> (v) This step checks the lower outer choke valve <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (WS), the middle pipe rams <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the lower inner kill valve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (WS) and the control package secondary master valve <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The inner gas vent <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the upper inner choke valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the lower inner kill valve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are in closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> (vi) The next test examines the integrity of the lower outer kill valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (WS), the upper pipe ram <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the upper inner choke valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (WS). The inner gas vent <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the lower outer choke valve <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the upper inner kill valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are all closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> To test the annular cavities, which can be classed as the medium pressure zone, is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> (vii) The lower annular <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is tested together with the upper inner kill valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (WS) but this can only be tested to the pressure of the lower annular. The inner gas vent <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valve and the lower outer kill valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are all in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> (viii) This step tests the integrity of the upper annular <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the inner gas vent valve <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, (WS) and the LRP - BOP stack connection and the upper outer kill valve <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (WS), but only to the annular test pressure. The upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valves and the lower outer kill valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are all in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (ix) This tests only the outer gas vent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (WS). The upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valves, the upper <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> outer kill valves are all in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> To test the shear blind ram cavity, which is classed as the high pressure zone, is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> (x) The test mandrel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is now separated at the coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> between the upper <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> sections so that the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be tested, together with the upper inner kill valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (WS). The outer gas vent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valves and the lower outer kill valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are all in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> (xi) The final test checks the upper outer kill valve <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (WS). The outer gas vent <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the upper <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outer choke valve and the lower outer kill valve <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are all in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> This now ensures that the barrier elements in either the high pressure or medium pressure zones have been tested at their correct working pressure and from both directions where applicable (i.e. rams and annulars are only tested from the well side). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows how the test assembly can be adapted to be used as a planned emergency BOP hang-off tool that, on installation, provides a prime bore and annulus barrier in the wellhead. Thus, in this arrangement, the BOP provides a second barrier to the environment in a planned emergency disconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Whilst on the surface, a one way downward differential pressure flow unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is installed, sealed and locked into the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. On installation, the plunger <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is depressed and this moves the circulation sleeve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> into the full circulation mode. This can be achieved by using a long thread section <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> that allows the unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to be screwed in using a connection <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a hand tool <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. The one way upward flow mechanism <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in the lower part of the test plug <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is now bypassed. This permits circulation down the drill pipe and up the annulus, yet any back pressure up the drill pipe will be contained by the one way downward flow mechanism <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The one way downward differential pressure unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides sufficient pressure differential to allow the release of the hydraulically activated anti-rotation coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In a planned emergency disconnector of the BOP lower riser package <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the adapted test assembly can be locked and sealed in the wellhead which closes off the bore and the annulus from upward pressure. All the sensors in the test assembly can monitor the parameters in the bore and the annulus, above and below the test plug. The pipe rams can be closed. After disconnecting the mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and closing the shear blind rams <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the. shear blind rams form the second barrier to the environment. The LRP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can now be released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> On return of the drilling vessel and reconnection of the LRP <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the parameters in the wellhead and the BOP can be obtained prior to operating any function in the BOP stack, reconnecting the mandrel coupling <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, rotating to open valve <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, circulating the well and pulling back the pipe in the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In a hang off situation, there may be no requirement to pull the wear bushing. To prevent this occurring in operation or testing, the wear bushing locking dogs <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> can be made ineffective by locking them in prior to running the test assembly. </paragraph>
