<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and, more particularly to, a method for manufacturing the LCD in which a columnar spacer is provided to maintain a gap to be filled with liquid crystal between a driver element substrate and a facing substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-140776 filed on May 10, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is widely used as a display for use in a variety of information apparatuses or a like The LCD has a basic configuration in that a gap is filled with liquid crystal between a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) substrate (driver element substrate) on which a Thin Film Transistor (TFT) operating as a driver element (switching element) is formed and a CF (Color Filter) substrate (facing substrate) on which a Color Filter (CF) is formed. In this configuration, conventionally, to maintain the gap between the TFT substrate and the CF substrate, a spherical spacers are disposed between these two substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, on either one of the two substrates, shown as an example, a TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are distributed spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> prepared beforehand that are made of resin or a like and that have a diameter of 4-8 &mgr;m Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B, a</cross-reference> CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is superposed over the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to come in contact with the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, so that these two substrates are adhered to each other to thereby form a liquid crystal cell. In this case, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are supposed to have been mounted with necessary components (elements) such as TFTs and CFs (they are not shown in the drawing for simplification) formed thereon already. Then, liquid crystal (not shown) is injected between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal cell, to which is then connected a peripheral driver circuit (not shown), thus completing the LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the method for manufacturing the LCD using spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above, the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> only need to be distributed on said either one of the two substrates, that is the TET substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, thus giving a merit of a simplified step of providing the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Oppositely, however, by this method, the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are distributed randomly on the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, so that they are not uniform in dispersion density (disposition density) and, because of their spherical shape, are liable to roll (move) on the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> during manufacture, thus giving a problem that they may readily move around to thereby deteriorate a so-called an &ldquo;on-the-surface uniformity&rdquo; Also, the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are present in some display picture elements, thus inevitably deteriorating contrast of the LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To solve these problems, a recent LCD has, in place of the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, columnar spacers disposed between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 11-305239 discloses an LCD (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B) having such a configuration that columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are disposed between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. These columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are typically formed on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by using the same material as the color filter and at the same time as, for example, this color filter is formed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The following will roughly describe a method for manufacturing a conventional LCD employing the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A, a</cross-reference> photo-resist film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> mainly made up of an acrylic resin is coated on such a surface of, for example, the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on which necessary components are formed beforehand as to face the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and then exposed, developed, and patterned to form the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are thus formed as fixed on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, therefore, do not vary in disposition density like the spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> nor move around on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> when manufactured, thus avoiding deteriorating the on-the-surface uniformity. Moreover, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be disposed at an arbitrary position and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> be adjusted not to be present in a display picture element, thus giving a merit of avoiding deteriorating the contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, an oriented film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> made up of, for example, polyimide with a solvent added is formed throughout on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by printing. Then, to remove the solvent from the inside of the oriented film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, orientation baking processing is performed on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Then, a seal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> made up of, for example, epoxy-resin is formed by printing at a predetermined position of the oriented film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In the side surface of the seal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed an injection hole <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for injecting liquid crystal therethrough., </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on which necessary components including TFTs are formed beforehand is superposed over the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to be in contact with the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In this superposition, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is aligned by, specifically, shifting the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> laterally with respect to the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so as to give a predetermined positional relationship between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by applying a predetermined superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Conventional superposition values are roughly the same as those when the spherical spacer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is employed, where they are aligned with each other by crushing the seal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> when applying the superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 0.3-0.6 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Then, seal baking processing is performed by heating the seal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to harden the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> while applying seal baking load W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (not shown) or about 0.5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, which is roughly the same value as that by use of spherical spacers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, across these the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> thus superposed one over the other. By doing so, a gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is maintained between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> due to the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, thus forming a liquid crystal cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>D, liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is injected through the injection hole <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in the seal <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to then perform under-pressure hole sealing processing for determining the gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> finally. This under-pressure hole sealing is carried out specifically by expelling extra liquid crystal from the inside of the liquid crystal cell and also as applying an under-pressure hole sealing load W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of at least about 0.6 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to make the gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> uniform. Subsequently, a peripheral driver circuit (not shown) is connected to the liquid crystal cell, thus completing the LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> This conventional method for manufacturing the LCD, however, has a problem that it is difficult to form a stable gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> using columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> because these columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are affected by the heat or the load from the manufacturing process after they are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> First, after being formed, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> shrink owing to the heat produced by the processing of an orientation baking process, thus being decreased in height. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, when the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are formed on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the oriented film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is printed throughout the surface and then the orientation baking processing is performed, the resultant heat affects the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> so that they would be fixed as shrunk as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, thus the gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> formed between them and the OFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> narrowing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, although in the under-pressure hole sealing process to determine the gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> finally, in order to make the gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> uniform, preferably a large under-pressure hole sealing load is applied to expel the extra liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, this large under-pressure hole sealing load has such an influence that when the temperature of an environment in which the LCD is used is changed, the shrinkage of the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> cannot keep pace with the shrinkage of the volume of the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, if the large under-pressure hole sealing load W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (for example, 0.6 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) is applied in under-pressure hole sealing, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are compressed If, in this case, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are sufficiently compressed already as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, they can keep pace in expansion with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> even when the environmental temperature is raised (to, for example, 70-80&deg; C.), thus maintaining a uniform gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> expands more than this preceding compression degree of the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, however, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> cannot keep pace in expansion with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in an arrow direction and so are separated from the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, thus making it impossible to maintain a uniform gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a case where the environmental temperature is lowered (to, for example, &minus;10&deg; C. through &minus;20&deg; C.), on the other hand, when the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are sufficiently compressed already as mentioned above and if the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shrinks in the arrow direction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> cannot be compressed any more and so cannot keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in shrinkage. As a result, a gas contained in the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> gives rise to air bubbles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which in turn deteriorates transmittance of light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If the large under-pressure hole sealing load is thus applied to seal the hole under pressure, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> cannot keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in expansion or shrinkage when the environment in which a finished LCD is used is exposed to a temperature which is higher or lower than the ordinary (room) temperature respectively, thus making it difficult to form a uniform gap </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also, by the conventional method for manufacturing the LCD, the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are affected by the heat or pressure applied in the manufacturing process after they are formed, thus making it difficult to manufacture a high-quality LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> That is, if the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are superposed one over the other while applying the large superposing load in the superposing process, they cannot easily be aligned with each other. If, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is disposed and then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, the large superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (of, for example, 0.3-0.6 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) is applied thereon, resultantly the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has a large friction force against the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This makes it difficult to shift the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> laterally, which in turn makes it difficult to align these substrates (TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and CF substrate <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) with each other, so that if the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is forcedly slipped, its surface may be damaged by the columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, thus possibly deteriorating the TFTS, the oriented film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or a like formed on that surface The deterioration, therefore, decreases the manufacture yield of the LCD, thus making it difficult to consistently manufacture a high-quality LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, since the seal baking process following the superposing process involves not only pressure application due to seal baking load but also heating, resultantly the columnar spacers may be deformed readily. The columnar spacers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> before seal baking such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, are subject to a drop in hardness in seal baking owing to application of the seal baking load W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the heat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B and so readily deformed, thus being left as deformed even after seal baking as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference>. In this case also, a uniform gap cannot be maintained </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an LCD manufacturing method that can form a stable gap using columnar spacers and also that can manufacture a high-quality LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing an LCD including a driver element substrate on which a driver element is formed and a facing substrate which faces the driver element substrate, into a gap between which is injected liquid crystal, a columnar spacer for maintaining the gap being disposed between the driver element substrate and the facing substrate, including; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> a columnar spacer forming step for forming the columnar spacer on either one of the driver element substrate and the facing substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> a seal forming step for forming a seal for adhering the driver element substrate and the facing substrate to each other after the columnar spacer is formed; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> a liquid crystal injecting step for injecting the liquid crystal through an injection hole formed in the seal beforehand after the driver element substrate and the facing substrate are adhered to each other by the seal; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> an under-pressure hole sealing step for sealing the injection hole after an extra amount of the liquid crystal is expelled through the injection hole, to then apply an under-pressure hole sealing load value of 0.15-0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>across the driver element substrate and the facing substrate in order to determine the gap finally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing, a preferable mode is one wherein between the seal forming step and the liquid crystal injecting step is interposed a superposing step for applying a superposing load value of 0.03-0.12 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>across the driver element substrate and the facing substrate to crush the seal in order to adhere the driver element substrate and the facing substrate to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another preferable mode is one wherein the superposing step is followed by a seal baking step for baking the seal by applying across the driver element substrate and the facing substrate a seal baking load value less than the under-pressure hole sealing load value employed in the under-pressure hole sealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Still another preferable mode is one wherein the columnar spacer forming step is followed by an oriented film forming step for forming an oriented film to cover the columnar spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further preferable mode is one wherein the oriented film forming step is followed by an oriented film baking step for baking the oriented film to remove a sol vent therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Still further preferable mode is one wherein the oriented film baking step is performed at a temperature of 150-230&deg; C. for one to three hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An additional preferable mode is one wherein the columnar spacer forming step is performed by applying a photo-resist film on said either one of the driver element substrate or the facing substrate to then pattern the photo-resist film into a desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Still additional preferable mode is one wherein the photo-resist film employed is of a negative type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further preferable mode is one wherein the columnar spacer is formed in a light-blocking region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Still further position of the light-blocking region is selected in a region where a black matrix layer is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With the above configurations, the columnar spacer is formed for maintaining the gap between the driver element substrate and the facing substrate to be filled with the liquid crystal to then perform the under-pressure hole sealing processing which determines the gap finally at the under-pressure hole sealing load value of 0.15-0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, so that even when an environment in which a finished LCD is used is exposed to a high or low temperature other than a ordinary (room) temperature, the columnar spacer can keep pace with the liquid crystal in expansion and shrinkage, thus making it to form a uniform gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is possible to form a stable gap by use of the columnar spacer and also to manufacture a high-quality LCD.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First, as as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which a TFT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed beforehand is provided. This TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes: a first transparent substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is made of glass or a like, a scanning line (gate line) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is formed at a part of a surface of the first transparent substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to thereby serve also as a gate electrode; a first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is formed to cover the scanning line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to serve also as a gate insulating film; a semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which is formed on the first inter layer insulating film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> over the scanning line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; a drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and a source electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which are formed at respective ends of the semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>; a signal line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is formed to be connected to the drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in such a manner as intersecting perpendicularly with the scanning line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; a second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is formed to cover the semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the source electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a like.; a picture element electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is formed on a surface of the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and which is connected to the source electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via a contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed in the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; and a first oriented film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is formed to cover the picture element electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Of these the scanning line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the drain electrode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the source electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> making up the TFT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be arranged so as to face the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided, The CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes: a second transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of glass or the like.; a black matrix layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is formed on a surface of the second transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to function as a light-blocking film for preventing light incidence upon the TFT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or for blocking a display-unrelated portion from light; a red filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>R, a green filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>G, and a blue filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B which make up e a color filter; a flattening film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is formed to cover the black matrix layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the red filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>R, the green filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>G, and the blue filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>B; and a common electrode <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which is formed to cover the flattening film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> mainly made up of acrylic resin is coated throughout such a side surface of the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to face the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and then is covered by a photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed therein at a position where a columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>) is to be formed. Next, the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is exposed to ultraviolet ray through the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for exposure and then the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is dipped into a developer to develop the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to remove the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> other than those portions thereof that were irradiated with ultra-violet ray through the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, thus forming the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. The columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed as fixed on the common electrode <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed outside the display picture elements, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in a region on the black matrix layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in order not to affect the optical transparency. In one example, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was formed to have a height of 4.45 &mgr;m and an area of 10&times;12 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Also, by using, in particular, the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be processed with a high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D, a</cross-reference> second oriented film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed by printing a polyimide (PI) film with a film thickness of 0.040-0.050 &mgr;m throughout the surface of the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At this stage in the process, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a height of about 4.5 &mgr;m. Then, to remove such a solvent as a polyamic acid from the second oriented film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, heat treatment is conducted on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at 150-230&deg; C. for one to three hours for an orientation baking processing. In the orientation baking processing, with the manufacturing method according to the embodiment, heat treatment conditions are selected from the above-mentioned range, so that non-polymerized and unhardened negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> mainly made up of acrylic resin of the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be completely polymerized and hardened At this stage, therefore, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shrinks little. At this stage, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stands at about 4.29 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, a series of rubbing processes are performed on the second oriented film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> including rubbing, rubbing washing, rubbing drying, and a like to then print, for example, epoxy resin at a predetermined position on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference> in order to form a seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thus completing the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used to adhere the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to each other. Also, on the first oriented film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the same series of rubbing processes as described above are performed, to complete the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>F, thus formed TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is superposed over thus formed CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in contact with the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Specifically, as applying the following value of a superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> across the TFT substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF. substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to crush seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shifted with respect to the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a horizontal direction x for such alignment that the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be in a predetermined positional relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> That is, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> were superposed one over the other by setting the superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at five values of 0.03 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.12 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.18 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.24 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The results are given in Table 1 below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Table 1 ranks degrees of (1) superposing operation, (2) seal shift, and (3) scar for each values of the superposing load w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to how they are performed or occurred. In Table 1, &xcirc; indicates that the item is not problematic, &Dgr; indicates that the item is a little problematic, and X indicates that the item is problematic, so that the item with &xcirc; is considered to be acceptable, to permit a product in process to be sent to the next manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As is clear from Table 1, only in the cases of the two superposing load w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> values of 0.03 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 0.12 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, none of (1) superposition operation, (2) seal shift, and (3) scar were problematic The other cases of the three superposing load w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> values of 0.18 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.24 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>were problematic because the superposing operation was impossible to perform, the superposing operation was performed but took a long time, or the seal shifted to scar a display portion such as the TFT, the oriented film, or a like. That is, this embodiment shows that if at least superposing load w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 0.18 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is applied in superposition, a conventional defect occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when superposing load w<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of not more than 0.12 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, preferably 0.03-0.12 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, is applied in superposition, a uniform gap can be formed. By doing so, in superposition, there is no possibility of damaging the TFT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the first oriented film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or the like formed on the surface of the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thus facilitating the manufacture of a high-quality LCD without deteriorating manufacturing yield thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C are illustrations for showing a state where a columnar spacer is not affected by superposing load in the LCD manufacturing method of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> before being superposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> has a small friction force even wren an initial pressure is applied thereon by the superposing load W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, so that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be smoothly shifted laterally with respect to the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. With this, therefore, as mentioned above, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be aligned with each other easily and so the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> need not be shifted forcedly, so that the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> does not damage the surface of the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, while applying a predetermined value of seal baking load across the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as aligned with each other, the seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is heated to harden the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a seal baking processing, thus forming a liquid crystal cell. To avoid the conventional defect from occurring, in this seal baking processing the value of seal baking load is to be selected smaller than that of the under-pressure hole sealing load selected in the following under-pressure hole sealing step that determines the gap. By this step, the elastic characteristics of the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not deteriorated any more, so that it is deformed less. In one example, in the seal baking processing, the seal baking load of about 0.46 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>was applied at a baking temperature of about 150&deg; C., whereupon the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stood about 4.15 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph for showing a relationship between load applied on the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (vertical axis) and a deformed amount (horizontal axis) when seal baking is performed and when it is not performed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> curve A indicates characteristics when the seal baking processing was performed and a curve B, those when the seal baking processing was not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, even with the same load being applied, the curve A with the case of seal baking being performed exhibits a smaller deformed amount than the curve B with the case of seal baking not being performed, thus indicating that the higher the hardness, the less is deformed the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C are illustrations for showing a state where a deformed amount of the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is becomes less by optimization for seal baking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> before seal baking as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> can be minimized in a deformed amount by performing low-load seal baking processing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, so that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> after the seal baking processing has nearly the same deformed amount as that before it. With this, a uniform gap can be maintained. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Table 2 evaluates how the performance of a finished LCD changed as a result of under-pressure hole sealing being performed at each value of the under-pressure hole sealing load for each environmental temperature of (1) ordinary temperature, (2) High temperature (for example, 70-80&deg; C.), and (3) Low temperature (for example, &minus;10&deg; C. through &minus;20&deg; C.), thus giving a &xcirc; mark to the case where this finished LCD is unproblematic as a commercial product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As is clear from Table 2, the manufactured LCD was unproblematic as a commercial product only when the under-pressure hole sealing processing was performed at the three under-pressure hole sealing load values of 0.15 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.30 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. When any of the other our values of 0 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.10 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.75 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 0.80 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>was used as the under-pressure hole sealing load, such a product problem occurred that the on-the-surface uniformity was poor depending on the environmental temperature, that the gap became non-uniform to change the display color tint, or that an air bubble was generated. That is, this embodiment shows that the conventional defect occurred if the hole was sealed under the under-pressure hole sealing load of not more than 0.10 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or not less than 0.75 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by setting the load at a value in a range of 0.15-0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in the under-pressure hole sealing, even when the environment in which a finished LCD is used is exposed to a high or low temperature other than the ordinary temperature, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can keep pace with.the LCD in expansion and shrinkage, thus making it easy to form a uniform gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C are illustrations for showing a state where the columnar spacer is not affected by under-pressure hole sealing by use of a seal in the LCD manufacturing method of the first embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, when the above-mentioned under-pressure hole sealing load W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied in the under-pressure hole sealing processing, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is compressed from a broken line down to a solid line. If the environmental temperature rises (for example, to 70-80&deg; C.) in this case, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sufficiently compressed already, so that elastic characteristics of the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> permits itself to keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in expansion, thus maintaining a uniform gap. If the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> expands more than the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was compressed, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is already sealed under pressure at an optimal under-pressure hole sealing load, so that it can keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in expansion and therefore will not be separated from the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thus maintaining a uniform gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If the environmental temperature is lowered (for example, to &minus;10&deg; C. through &minus;20&deg; C.), on the other hand, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is sufficiently compressed already as mentioned above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can shrink more than the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> possibly does, so that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in shrinkage As a result, a gas, if contained in the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, does not give rise to air bubbles </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thus, by applying an optimal under-pressure hole sealing load in the under-pressure hole sealing processing, even when the environment in which a finished LCD is used is exposed to a high or low temperature other than the ordinary temperature, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can keep pace with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in expansion and shrinkage, thus making it easy to form a uniform gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the subsequent processes, according to almost the same method as an ordinary LCD manufacturing method, a polarizing plate (not shown) is formed outside the first transparent substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to then connect a peripheral driver circuit (not shown) to the liquid crystal cell, thus completing the LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Table 3 shows how the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed beforehand changes in height as affected by the hear or the load by the main processes in an LCD manufactured by the above-mentioned manufacturing processes.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the Table 3, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is affected little by the heat or the load from each of the main processes; in fact, its initial height in formation decreased only by about 8.2% finally. It means that this embodiment makes it possible to maintain the gap in a stable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Thus, by the LCD manufacturing method according to this embodiment, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed to maintain a gap between the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is to be filled with the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to then perform the under-pressure hole sealing processing that determines the gap finally under an under-pressure hole sealing load value of 0.15-0.60 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, so that even when an environment in which a finished LCD is used is exposed to a high or low temperature other than the ordinary temperature, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can keep pace with the liquid crystal in expansion and shrinkage, thus making it easy to make the gap Uniform </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is possible to form a stable gap by use of the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and also to manufacture a high-quality LCD. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 8B</cross-reference>, an LCD manufacturing method according to a second embodiment differs greatly from that according to the above-mentioned first embodiment in that a columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on a TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> That is, by the LCD manufacturing method according to this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, first the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which a TFT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed beforehand is provided, and a negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> mainly including an acrylic resin is applied throughout such a side surface of the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as to face a CF substrate (not shown) and then covered by a photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed therein at a position where the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is to be formed. Next, ultraviolet ray is applied through the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for exposure and then the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Next, the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is dipped into a developer to develop the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to remove the negative photo-resist film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> other than those portions thereof that were irradiated with ultra-violet ray through the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the photo-mask <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, thus forming the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. This columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed as fixed on a picture element electrode <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the columnar spacer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed outside the display picture elements in order not to affect the optical transparency like in the case of forming it on the CF substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The subsequent processes may be repeated almost the same way as described with the first embodiment. The description of these processes, therefore, is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Thus, by this embodiment, almost the same effects can be obtained as those by the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments but may be changed and modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, although the embodiments have been described with reference to the example in which a TFT is used as a driver element to drive liquid crystal, the driver element is not limited to the TFT; for example, such a two-terminal element may be used as an MIS (Metal Insulator Metal)-type element, a diode type element, a varistor-type elements, or a like. Also, although the embodiments have been described with reference to the example of a transparent LCD in which a transparent substrate made of glass or a like is used as the driver element substrate, it is not limited to a transparent ones for example, an opaque substrate made of poly-silicon or a like may be used. In this case, the LCD becomes a reflection-type one, in which the picture element electrode operates as a reflection electrode serving also as a reflection plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Also, although the color filter has been formed on the facing substrate in the embodiments, it may be formed on the driver element substrate. Also, the present invention is applicable to both the TN (Twisted Nematic)-type and IPS (In-Plane Switching)-type LCDs. </paragraph>
