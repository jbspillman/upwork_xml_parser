<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention is directed to assembly of a plurality of joined panel parts. Some of the individual parts contain a pre-applied curable adhesive to one or more sides or edges. An initiating metal activator is applied to complementing edges and cure is activated when the parts are assembled. The pre-applied adhesive system contains monomer(s), initiators, oligomers, an acid, and a sulfonyl compound. An activating or initiating metal foil, dispersion or coating is applied to the complementary surface. The bonding is effected when the adhesive system is activated by mating the edges. The activating metal is a reducible elemental transition metal. The metal is affixed to one surface which is brought into proximity with the curable adhesive compound dispensed onto the complementing part. The invention has usefulness in the joining of wood, wood products, composites of wood, thermoset polymer panels, non-initiating metal panels, and thermoplastic/wood composites, and the like to provide self-bonding assemblies having appearance surfaces, such as wall or floor coverings, especially assemblies that used joined board-like construction members. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention related to the field of adhesive bonding of non-metallic panels, such as low, medium or high density fiberboard, laminates thereof, and/or thermoplastic substrates. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pre-assembled articles, for example home furnishings, office components, can be configured to utilize engineered mechanical fastening systems which are recessed and include covering systems to improve the finished aesthetic appearance. Many furniture articles, and office panel systems contain such state of the art fastening mechanisms. Pre-applied adhesive systems for these articles are not established due to activation and/or cure activation mechanisms that would be cumbersome or inconsistently applied by installers, and therefore unacceptable to obtain the structural integrity needed with on-site assembly of pre-fabricated components. Nevertheless, an adhesive system which is pre-applied at the fabrication stage would be industrially desirable, especially for home furnishings and office components that provide a continuous decorative surface of joined panels or slats. These are assembled at the site and may be anchored to structural supports such as a floor or wall. It would be of industrial importance to provide a pre-applied adhesive system that does not require additional activation steps, and would activate, bond and cure to high strength simply on assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Designing a pre-applied adhesive system with read-to-assemble bonding characteristics presents several challenges to achieve shelf-stability, green-strength, open time, curing time, and ultimate bond strength to hold the panel or slat members together upon installation. The adhesive must also possess controllable properties within sufficient application tolerances from the standpoint of the fabrication process. The inventors have undergone extensive development adaptation of an adhesive system that can be pre-applied to non-initiating metal substrates, such as steel panels or slats and later bonded after assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,658,254 is directed to two-package anaerobic acrylic adhesive. This system is not readily adaptable as a pre-applied adhesive system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,880,956 and 3,957,561, disclose anaerobic acrylic adhesive compositions which are activated by contact with metal surfaces. The compositions are single-package anaerobic compositions containing diazonium salt catalysts which cure through a free radical polymerization mechanism when excluded from air or oxygen and in contact with certain metal surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,561 discloses one-package anaerobic compositions utilizing a two-component catalyst system comprising at least one diazosulfone compound and o-sulfobenzimide which cure through a free radical polymerization mechanism when the adhesive is excluded from air or oxygen and in contact with active metal surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,052,244, utilizes copper in the form of a copper salt of saccharin or p-toluenesulfonic acid to provide two-package anaerobic adhesives whose cure is otherwise not dependent on substrate composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,308, discloses two-package adhesives which utilize, in one package, copper saccharinate or saccharin in combination with a soluble copper salt, and in the other package, an alpha-hydroxy sulfone, an alpha-aminosulfone or mixtures of such sulfones, as catalytic agents for the free radical curing of the anaerobic acrylic adhesive compositions. The cure of the Skoultchi U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,308 compositions is independent of substrate composition. </paragraph>

Nos. 4,703,089; 4,855,001; and 4,857,131 disclose one-package acrylic adhesives which cure at ambient temperatures when brought into contact with certain metal surfaces, whether or not air or oxygen is excluded. The adhesive contains an olefinically unsaturated monomer, a polymeric material, a sulfonyl halide, a transition metal, and an acidic compound. Sulfonyl halide-containing adhesives may, in some instances, catalyze or promote corrosion which may lead to the degradation of the adhesive bond. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed to apparatus and method for joining the apparatus, which comprises panels or slats which are pretreated on one or more than one bonding edge(s), up to all bonding edges provided on one set of panels, with an adhesive that is cured by an initiator or activating metal containing layer applied to one, or more, or all edges of a complementing set of panels, the complementing set to be joined in a plurality of bonded panels by curing and bonding at the edge surfaces. The adhesive is advantageously applied at the fabrication stage of the panels. An inert metal activator is applied, i.e., affixed to the complementary edge on the same or other panel. The fabricated, adhesive-treated panels or slats can be stored unassembled for extended periods of time prior to assembly. Storage stability under environmental conditions commonly encountered in the industry is achieved. At the time of installation, such as at a work site, the prefabricated panels materials are unpacked and the edges containing the adhesive are mated to the complementary edges containing the inert metal activator layer. The adhesive is activated, and provides a designed open time as little or as long so to provide for any adjustment of the assembly if needed, and the assembly is bonded together by the curing after further time to provide a structurally sound bond that can withstand flexure, or tension over long periods of time without disengagement of the members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the method aspect, two parts are joined by assembling opposing complimentary edges together, one set of complementing edges contains adhered to its surfaces a resin compound comprising, in admixture, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one olefincially unsaturated monomer, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (b) an organic or inorganic acid, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (c) a sulfonyl compound, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (d) an optional oligomer; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (e) a thixotrope; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> And affixed to the opposite complementing edges is a transition metal activator which is placed in contact with the adhesive resin, and curing is initiated, forming a bond between the complimentary edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The adhesive viscosity is in advantageously provided in the range of about 20,000 to 40,000 Cps using conventional thickeners and/or fillers. One such thickener is a conventional thixotrope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To the opposite bonding side(s) a layer containing a foil or dispersed particulate transitional metal initiator, affixed for example by an adhesive coated, for instance on the metallic foil, or tape. The transitional metal initiator can be present as a metal-doped binder coating on at least a portion of the bonding surface on the sides opposing or complimentary to the bonding surfaces containing the pre-applied curable resin compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case of the substrates being manufactured wood products, such as wood panels or slats, an edge sealant is preferably first applied prior to applying the adhesive and the initiating metal layer. The sealant provides a moisture barrier and a barrier to inhibit the migration of residues that interfere with curing of the adhesive. A UV curable edge sealant applied to unfinished edges of wood-products unexpectedly provided significantly reduced moisture gain. </paragraph>

Typical sulfonyl-silicon compounds include methanesulfonyl trimethylsilane, benzenesulfonyltriethoxysilane, methanesulfonyltrihydroxysilane and ethanesulfonylethoxydimethoxysilane, with methanesulfonyl trimethylsilane being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although R&prime;, R&Prime;, and R&prime;R&Prime; are defined above with respect to preferences for the respective sulfonyl-sulfur, phosphorus and -silicon compounds, R&prime;, R&Prime;, and R&prime;&Prime; can, in general, be any substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group containing typically from 1 to 24 carbon atoms; or any substituted or unsubstituted aryl group containing typically from 6 to 30 carbon atoms. Organic R&prime;, R&Prime;, and R&prime;R&Prime; groups can also be polymeric materials, such as polyolefins or polyurethanes. Inorganic R&prime;, R&Prime;, and R&prime;R&Prime; groups include H, OH, SH, NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiOH, Cl, and metal ions such as Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Ni<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, and Al<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The amount of sulfonyl-containing compound is generally suitable in a range of from 0.05 to about 5% by weight on weight of adhesive in the bead applied to the one set of members to be joined. The sulfonyl compounds are available commercially and can be made by conventionally known methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The metal initiators include salts and organic derivatives or complexes of copper, zinc, cobalt, vanadium, iron and manganese. Inorganic compounds containing the transition metals as the metal salts exemplified by the bromides, chlorides, phosphates, sulfates, sulfides and oxides of the transition metals. Likewise, organic compounds containing the transition metals can be used, such as transition metal salts of organic mono- and poly-carboxylic acids; and mono- and poly-hydroxy compounds, such as cupric acetate, cupric maleate, cupric hexoate, iron naphthenate, cobaltous and cobaltic naphthenate and the like. Particularly preferred organic derivatives are sulfamide and sulfonamide compounds which contain the transition metal. This partial listing of suitable organic and inorganic transition metal salts will lead to suggestive other useful salts as will be readily obvious to those skilled in the art. The transition metal compounds will be employed in the adhesive compositions of this invention in a range from about 0.05 to 5, preferably about 0.2 to 2.5, percent by weight, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The transition metal-containing organic compounds are typically soluble when contacted with the adhesive compositions, are preferred activating metal compounds. It is preferred that the activator transition metal compound, be it organic or inorganic, have some degree of solubility, either in the adhesive composition itself or in an inert solvent which is preferably compatible with the adhesive compositions. In the use of a transition metal having limited solubility, these can advantageously be dissolved in an inert solvent or carrier material as part of the metal activator layer formed on the opposite complimentary edges of the articles to be joined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The adhesive system should exhibit a degree of self-support, and resist flow after applied to the part. This is advantageously obtained with the use of a thixotrope. Suitable thixotropes are conventionally used in adhesive compounds. Thixotropic properties can be achieved from a myriad of known additives in the art and include alumina, limestone, talc, zinc oxides, sulfur oxides, calcium carbonate, perlite, slate flour, salt (NaCl), cyclodextrin and the like. Thixotropes provide an essential antisagging property in the present adhesive system. Exemplary thixotropes include castor waxes, treated clays also referred to as Fuller&apos;s earth clays including sepiolite, palygorskite and attapulgite, and the preferred silicas like fumed silica. Useful sources of the thixotrope include those available under the AEROSIL&reg; mark from Degussa, Cab-O-SIL&reg; from Cabot, CASTORWAX&reg; from Caschern, BENTONE&reg;, THIXATROL&reg; and THIXCIN&reg; from Rheox, and DISLON&reg; from King. Attapulgite, hydrated magnesium silicate clay processed by Engelhard Co., Floridin Co. and others are effective thixotropes. The following U.S. patents teach various conventional thixotropic additives for use in the present adhesive system used herein: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,476,889, 5,247,000, 5,204,386, 5,152,918, 5,001,193, 6,133,398, 5,852,103, 4,940,852 and 5,385,990. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Optional components includable in the adhesive are conventional inhibitors, antioxidants, fillers and stabilizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The sealers which are suitable are conventional waxes, paraffins, in particular, acrylic, vinyl, SBR, PVDC latex paints and coatings, urethanes, and the like. They can be roller coated, such as with a foam roller, or spray applied, or other conventional edge coating method. A preferred type of sealer is an acrylic curable coating containing a photoinitiator. Suitable conventional UV curable coatings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,288 incorporated by reference. A UV cured coating containing an aziridine crosslinker is more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The geometries available for the panel or slat joint design are too numerous to mention all which are suitable. Such designs include, but are not limited to, tongue and groove, scarf, lap, strap, finger, grooves an spline, and snap-fit joints. In joints of the tongue and groove type and most snap fit geometries, the adhesive is preferentially applied in a recess, or corner, such as within a groove or female, or any recessed portion to advantageously avoid contact during handling. The cure activator would correspondingly be placed on the tongue or male snap fit portion. The spline design would contain adhesive in both grooves and the spline would carry the cure activator. Designs of lap and scarf type would utilize adhesive on one joint face and the cure activator on the other joint face. Grooves can be on all sides of a member, and tongues can be on all sides of a complementing member. Elongated slats, such as individual flooring slats typically have on each member a tongue side and a groove side. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A tongue and groove type joint of medium density fiberboard (MDF) was joined. Firstly the surface area of the tongue and groove was coated (&tilde;0.001&Prime; thick) with a conventional UV curable acrylic coating. The sealer coating was cured using an Aetek UV curing unit which applied approximately 1200 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>energy. This coating was applied to prevent compounds (probably lignin and formaldehyde) in the MDF from inhibiting adhesive cure. This phenomenon was previously observed when attempting to join MDF in lap shear geometry. An adhesive formulation was then applied in the groove. The tongue was first coated with a Lord UV curable coating with zinc powder dispersed into it. This coating was cured to the tongue using the same UV cure unit and energies as described above and lightly abraded to expose fresh zinc on the surface. The prepared tongue and groove samples were then joined. Joint strengths were tested after 24 hours and averaged 94 lbs./in. </paragraph>
