<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of roofing tile installation. More particularly, the invention provides a method and apparatus for providing drainage, ventilation, closure, and support to the roof tiles along the eaves at roof transitions such as valleys and side walls. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The installation of a tile roof involves a variety of technical challenges and problems not encountered during the installation of a traditional shingle roof. Shingles are relatively thin and can be placed almost flat onto the roof decking in overlapping rows, but roofing tiles are thicker and do not tend to lie as flat when overlapping one another. Roofing tiles, therefore, require special installation methods and devices, particularly at roof transitions such as valleys and side walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In additional to flat tile, modern roof tiles are made in a variety of sizes and shapes to complement different architectural styles. For example, a traditional S-shaped tile might be used for Spanish style architecture, while a W-shaped tile might be used for a Mediterranean style project. The multitude of shapes available today increases the complexity of the technical challenges and problems when installing a tile roof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical roof includes a solid plywood decking covered by a waterproof underlayment which is then covered by shingles or roof tiles. At roof transitions such as valleys and side walls, an additional device generally known as a flashing must be installed to collect the flow of water and direct it off the roof. A flashing is also installed at head walls, around chimneys, and around pipes and vents penetrating the roof. Because roof tiles, unlike shingles, do not tend to lay flat upon the flashing, specialized flashing styles have been designed to accommodate the peculiar needs of tile roofs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For a valley transition, a typical flashing style currently in use for tile roofs is called valley flashing. Valley flashing features a series of built-in support ribs or corrugations to provide support for the roof tiles and to create defined troughs to channel water off the roof. Valley flashing resembles corrugated sheet metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For a side wall transition, a typical flashing style currently in use for tile roofs consists of a Z-bar and a side wall flashing (also called a tile pan or a wall tray). A Z-bar is a length of sheet metal that is z-shaped in cross section and designed to catch water flowing down the side wall and channel it into the side wall flashing. A side wall flashing is roughly L-shaped in cross section, but, like the valley flashing, it may contain one or more built-in support ribs or corrugations to channel water off the roof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For roof transitions, generally, a flashing is used to cover the seam between the generally planar roof sections, to prevent leakage. A typical flashing includes corrugations positioned to channel water directly off the roof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Generally, roof tiles rest upon one another in overlapping rows called courses. At the eaves of the roof, however, the lower edge of the tiles have no other tiles upon which to rest. So, for proper installation, the lowermost edge of the eaves course of tiles must be elevated above the roof decking to the proper angle or pitch. Supports known as eave risers are typically installed along the eaves to elevate the lowermost edge of the eaves course of roof tiles. An example of such an eave riser is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,505 issued to Thompson on Dec. 6, 1983. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Most eave riser designs include holes for drainage and ventilation. Adequate drainage and ventilation is critical to proper installation of a tile roof because the accumulation of water behind and under the tiles can lead to serious and expensive problems such as wood rot, structural failure, and roof leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A typical eave riser is configured for installation along a generally straight eaves and atop a generally planar roof decking and waterproof underlayment. Although the roof decking and waterproof underlayment may be installed upon a pitched roof, it is generally smooth. A series of straight eave risers can be installed, end to end, along the eaves of the roof. At roof transitions such as valleys and side walls, however, the flashing changes the otherwise flat contour of the roof surface, especially when the flashing contains built-in support ribs or other corrugations. In the field, therefore, an installer may need to cut holes in a typical straight eave riser to accommodate the corrugations in a flashing at a roof transition. Such custom fitting in the field is expensive, time-consuming, and may often result in a significant loss of structural capacity at a critical roof transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus for elevating and supporting the eaves course of tile at roof transitions where the valley flashing or side wall flashing includes support ribs or other corrugations. Such an apparatus should maintain sufficient drainage and ventilation at the roof transition. Such a method and apparatus should accomplish these goals in a reliable, durable, attractive, low-maintenance, and cost-effective manner. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above and other needs are met by the present invention which, in one embodiment, provides a system for supporting and ventilating a tile roof along the eaves at a roof transition, such as a valley or a side wall, while facilitating drainage and promoting ventilation. Generally described, the present invention provides a roof transition system for a tile roof. The tile roof is characterized by a generally planar roof surface, a plurality of roof tiles, and a plurality of straight eave risers positioned along the eaves. The roof transition system includes a flashing disposed atop the roof transition and an eave riser extension disposed atop the flashing. The eave riser extension has sufficient height to support the roof tiles at a desired pitch and has one or more openings that are sized and shaped to permit ventilation and drainage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the system, the eave riser extension is generally L-shaped in cross section, having a base positioned along the generally planar roof surface and a riser fa&ccedil;ade to support the roof tiles. In one embodiment, the eave riser extension also includes a rim along the top of the riser fa&ccedil;ade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the roof transition system, the roof transition defines a vertical transition plane, and the eave riser extension is of sufficient length to span the distance between the transition plane and a nearest open end of one of the straight eave risers. In this aspect, the eave riser extension has an engaging end for connecting to the straight eave riser and a free end that is positioned in or near the transition plane of the roof transition. Where the flashing includes one or more corrugations, the openings through the eave riser extension are further sized and shaped to coincide with and span the width of the corrugations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention, in one embodiment, provides an apparatus for supporting and ventilating a tile roof along the eaves at a roof transition. Generally described, the present invention comprises an cave riser extension having a base and a riser fa&ccedil;ade. The riser fa&ccedil;ade is connected to the base along the length of the eave riser extension. The riser fa&ccedil;ade has sufficient height to support the roof tiles at a desired pitch, and may include a rim along its top edge. The riser fa&ccedil;ade has one or more openings that are sized and shaped to facilitate ventilation and drainage. The base may includes openings as well. Where the flashing includes one or more corrugations, the openings through the cave riser extension are further sized and shaped to coincide with and span the width of the corrugations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the apparatus, the eave riser extension spans the distance between the transition plane and a nearest open end of one of the straight eave risers. In this aspect, the cave riser extension has an engaging end that is sized and shaped to connect to the straight eave riser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention, in one embodiment, provides a method for providing ventilation and closure to the eaves of a tile roof at a roof transition. Generally described, the method present invention comprises the steps of installing a flashing atop the roof transition, positioning an eave riser extension atop the flashing, and laying the roof tiles atop the eave riser extension at the desired pitch. The eave riser extension has a plurality of openings to facilitate ventilation and drainage, and is long enough to span the distance from the nearest open end of one of the straight eave risers to the transition plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the method, the engaging end of the eave riser extension is connected to the open end of the nearest straight eave riser to provide closure to the tile roof. Where the flashing includes one or more corrugations, the method may include sizing and shaping the openings through the eave riser extension to coincide with and span the width of the corrugations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention, in one embodiment, provides a method of fabricating an eave riser extension for supporting and ventilating a tile roof at a roof transition. The method comprises the steps of selecting a sheet of material having sufficient strength to support the roof tiles and sufficient ductility to withstand bending, treating the sheet to improve its resistance to corrosion in the expected use environment, and cutting a portion from the sheet according to a pattern. The pattern is sized and shaped to encompass all parts of the eave riser extension. The portion cut from the sheet has one, uninterrupted, linear edge along its length. The method further includes the step of bending a base segment from the side opposing the linear edge, according to the pattern, until the base segment is approximately perpendicular to the remaining portion. In one embodiment, the method further includes the step of bending a rim segment lengthwise along the linear edge, toward the base segment, according to the pattern, until the rim segment forms an acute angle with the remaining portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a roof transition system to support the first course of roof tiles on a supporting roof structure along the eaves at a desired pitch near a roof transition such as a valley or side wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to facilitate the circulation of air underneath the roof tiles. It is a related object of this invention to optimize the heat transfer between the roof tiles and the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to facilitate the shedding of water off the roof from underneath the roof tiles at a roof transition without any appreciable damming or ponding. It is a related object of this invention to channel water along the flashing beneath the tiles and direct it away from the eaves of the roof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an eave riser extension for use at a variety of roof transitions having different sizes and shapes. It is a related object of the present invention to provide an eave riser extension to accommodate corrugated flashings without compromising ventilation or drainage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is further an object of the present invention to provide an eave riser extension configured for easy field assembly to existing straight eave risers, thereby completing an eave riser that spans the entire width of the eaves course of roof tile to be supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a roof transition system and an eave riser extension that prevents the infiltration of wind-driven precipitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a roof transition system and an cave riser extension that inhibits bird nesting and other animal invasion through the eaves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> These and other objects are accomplished by the method and apparatus disclosed and will become apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like numerals designate like elements.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to the figures, in which like elements indicate like elements throughout the several views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the inventive roof transition system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as installed, relative to the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of a roof structure. The roof transition system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> generally includes a flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for ventilation and drainage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A roof transition occurs at the intersection of two or more differently-oriented roof sections. For example, a valley transition is formed on the roof of an L-shaped structure where the two generally planar roof sections meet. A side wall transition is formed where the roof of a structure meets the vertical wall of an adjacent structure that is higher. The roof transition is defined by the line or seam that is formed along the intersection of the adjacent roof sections. A vertically-oriented, two-dimensional plane that passes through the roof transition is called the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Valley Transitions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The roof transition system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes an eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on each side of a roof transition called a valley. The cave riser extensions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> support the lower edge of the first course of roof tiles along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> at a desired pitch. A vertical plane passing through the center of the valley is called the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed on top of the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are located directly over the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the flow of water along the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to pass through the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> unimpeded. Preferably, the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends beyond the plane of the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, creating a flashing overhang <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to direct the water beyond the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are disposed in planar contact with one another. As such, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally L-shaped in cross section. The openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, may take any shape that provides sufficient ventilation and drainage and accommodates passage of the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or other features of the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may penetrate both the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, or the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alone. In a preferred embodiment, the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> penetrate both the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be installed along the roof structure, with the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending generally upward from the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be perpendicular to the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, may be vertical, as long as the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has sufficient height to support the first row of roof tiles at a desired pitch. The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also include a rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, located along the top of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for added strength and stability. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are disposed in planar contact with one another. In the embodiment shown, the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends rearward from the top edge of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extends downward at an angle toward the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; however, this is not the only suitable configuration. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extend forward, along the lowermost surface of the roof tiles. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may also extend in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Other rim configurations are contemplated that will provide strength and stability to the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When installed, the roof tiles in a preferred embodiment simply rest atop the uppermost edge of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without requiring an attachment. Certain applications, however, may require an attachment between one or more tiles and the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material for the expected outdoor environment. Corrosion resistance, long life, and general durability are some of the features desired for such tile roof support installations. In one embodiment, the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of galvanized aluminum or steel having a baked-on enamel coating. The cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be made from a solid sheet of material or, alternatively, may be made from a sheet of rigid screen or mesh of sufficient strength to support the expected load of the roof tiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from a single piece of material that is capable of being bent into the desired configuration while maintaining its strength. In this aspect, one embodiment of the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, may be constructed by bending the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until it is approximately perpendicular to the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be bent rearward toward the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until it forms an angle of about forty-five degrees with the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be cut from the material before or after bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment, the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are generally parallel to the natural flow of water off the roof. These corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provide structure to the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a channel for the water flow. Preferably, the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the eave riser extensions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> coincide with and span the distance across the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, but are somewhat larger than the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, so as to provide an opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In general, supports referred to as straight eave risers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are installed along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of a generally straight roof edge and atop a generally planar roof decking. Straight eave risers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> generally include at least a base, a riser fa&ccedil;ade, and an upper rim for stability. In another aspect of the invention, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned similarly to an end portion of the straight eave riser <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> such that an engaging end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be connected to the open end of the nearest straight eave riser <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rests at or near the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the engaging end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to receive by insertion a portion of the open end of one of the straight eave risers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the joining of the two risers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can be accomplished in the field without tools. The free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may or may not be attached to one or more elements lying within or near the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, configured for a valley transition, the free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> terminates at the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which lies through the center of the valley. Because a roof valley, by definition, involves the meeting of two roof surfaces, another eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be needed on the opposing side of the valley. In similar fashion, the free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the opposing eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> terminates at the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> located through the center of the valley. In this embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the free ends <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> meet one another at the center of the valley. Preferably, the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, if any, nearest the free ends <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extensions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have curved boundaries which meet in the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to provide sufficient ventilation and drainage and to accommodate structural features that may be present within or near the transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Side Wall Transitions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The roof transition system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, installed at a roof transition called a side wall. The eave riser extensions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> support the lower edge of the first course of roof tiles along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> at a desired pitch. The transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at a sidewall transition is a vertical plane defined by the surface of the side wall <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> or the side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For a side wall transition such as the one depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> typical flashing currently in use on tile roofs consists of a Z-bar <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (also called a wall tray or a tile pan). The Z-bar <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is a length of sheet metal that is z-shaped in cross section and designed to catch water flowing down the side wall and channel it into the side wall flashing. A side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is roughly L-shaped in cross section; however, like the corrugated valley flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may contain one or more built-in support ribs or corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to channel water off the roof. In another similarity, the side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extends beyond the plane of the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, creating an overhang <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to direct the water beyond the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed on top of the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are located directly over the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the flow of water along the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to pass through the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> unimpeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are disposed in planar contact with one another. The openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, may take any shape that provides sufficient ventilation and drainage and accommodates passage of the corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or other features of the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may penetrate both the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, or the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alone. In a preferred embodiment, the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> penetrate both the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be installed along the roof structure, with the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extending generally upward from the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be perpendicular to the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, may be vertical, as long as the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has sufficient height to support the first row of roof tiles at a desired pitch. The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also include a rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, located along the top of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for added strength and stability. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are disposed in planar contact with one another. In the embodiment shown, the rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends rearward from the top edge of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extends downward at an angle toward the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; however, this is not the only suitable configuration. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extend forward, along the lowermost surface of the roof tiles. The rim <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may also extend in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Other rim configurations are contemplated that will provide strength and stability to the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When installed, the roof tiles in a preferred embodiment simply rest atop the uppermost edge of the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without requiring an attachment.

<heading lvl="1">Ventilation Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention generally provides a method for closing and ventilating the lowermost row of roof tiles along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> at a roof transition. In one aspect of the method, a flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to the roof surface at a transition. An cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned on top of the flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the riser fa&ccedil;ade <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends upward from the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first course of roof tiles is laid along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> such that the roof tiles rest upon the top of the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a desired pitch. Certain applications may require an attachment between one or more tiles and the eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the method, in an embodiment wherein the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an engaging end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the engaging end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be joined to a portion of an open end of the straight cave risers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> already installed along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the engaging end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be joined to an adjacent straight cave riser <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> without tools or fasteners. The free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may or may not be joined to any particular element where it terminates at or near the roof transition plane <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the present invention provides a roof transition system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to support the first course of roof tiles on a supporting roof structure along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> at a desired pitch near a roof transition such as a valley or side wall. Water flows across the top of the valley flashing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or side wall flashing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and flows freely through openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without any appreciable damming or ponding. Water flow is facilitated by one or more corrugations <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and by an overhang <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Air circulates underneath the roof tiles along the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and throughout the roof structure, resulting in reduced heat transfer from the roof tiles into the attic space. The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> blocks wind-driven precipitation, inhibits bird nesting, and prevents the invasion of animals into and through the eaves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> at roof transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the present invention provides a ventilated eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use at a variety of roof transitions having different sizes, shapes, and angles. Moreover, the cave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured for easy field assembly to the end of a straight eave riser <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, thereby accomplishing the completion of an eave riser that spans the entire length of the eaves course of roof tile. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Method of Fabrication </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed from a single piece of material that is capable of withstanding the forces of bending while maintaining its strength. The eave riser extension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may begin as a solid sheet of metal or, alternatively, as a sheet of rigid screen or mesh having sufficient ductility and strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the method of fabrication begins with treating the selected sheet of material to improve its corrosion resistance. Such treatments include galvanizing, coating, painting, and other methods of protecting the material without compromising its strength. The fabrication includes cutting a portion from the sheet according to a pattern. The pattern is sized and shaped to encompass all parts of the cave riser extension, including the base, the riser fa&ccedil;ade, the rim if provided, and all the openings. The portion cut from the sheet has one, uninterrupted, linear edge along its length, which forms the top edge of the riser fa&ccedil;ade or the rim, if one is provided. The method further includes the step of bending a base segment from the side opposing the linear edge, according to the pattern, until the base segment is approximately perpendicular to the remaining portion (which forms the riser fa&ccedil;ade). In one embodiment, the method further includes the step of bending a rim segment lengthwise along the linear edge, toward the base segment, according to the pattern, until the rim segment forms an acute angle with the remaining portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additions, substitutions, modifications, and deletions not specifically described may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
