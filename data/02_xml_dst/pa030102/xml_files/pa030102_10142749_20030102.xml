<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to desktop tools for the provisioning and management of package delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The management of parcel shipping data within a company, regardless of the size of the company, is an important function. By efficiently managing and using parcel shipping data, the company can save significant transaction and overhead costs. To that end, carriers have developed and deployed numerous software tools that enable their customers to access shipping data more efficiently than ever before. For example, United Parcel Service of America, Inc. (&ldquo;UPS&rdquo;) has launched a web-based service called My UPS.com to provide customers with internet shipping services, enhanced tracking services, supply order services, etc., through an automated system that provides requested information in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While such tools are an improvement over prior art systems and methods, these tools still require the user to perform numerous steps to obtain certain shipping information. For example, a user working on a spreadsheet document or word processor document may identify within that document a tracking number associated with a certain parcel for which the user wishes to obtain shipping information such as the status of the parcel&apos;s delivery. In order to obtain this information, the user typically has to open their internet browser application, go to a particular web site provided by the carrier, possibly log into the web site and then either type or copy/paste the tracking number into the appropriate web page. The web site then processes the tracking number and then presents the requested shipping information to the user via a web page interface. If the user then wishes to place some or all of the shipping information into the spreadsheet or word processor document, then the user must copy that information from the internet browser application and paste it into the document in which they are working, often creating formatting problems in the document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a yet unsatisfied need in the industry for further reducing the steps required by a user to obtain and process shipping data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention enables users to access shipping information pertaining to the shipment of parcels by merely selecting an action from a tool bar or menu associated with a text string in a document or spreadsheet either recognized by a Microsoft Office smart tag or highlighted by user. The actions from which to select include but are not limited to tracking, time in transit, shipping history, label generation, address validation, proof of delivery and rate and service selection. The present invention automatically cuts the necessary text from the document or spreadsheet in which the user is working, opens or accesses databases, files, applications, websites, etc., as required to obtain the desired shipping information from a database accessible by the user, such as over a LAN or Internet connection. The present invention processes the data retrieved (including cutting, pasting, inserting or manipulating data and initiating actions such as dialing a phone number, generating a label or sending an e-mail) and preferably presents the results to the user in a message box or as an insert into the document or spreadsheet in which the user is working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a system for obtaining shipping information associated with a parcel comprises a server including a database having shipping information associated with a parcel, wherein the information is accessible by users, and a software application operable on a computer that is remote to the server and in communication with the server, wherein the software application recognizes predefined text strings or a user selects a text string for which one or more predefined actions can be invoked, including accessing at least certain of the shipping information at the sever associated with a recognized text string. When an action is selected, it causes the software application to send user identification information to the server in a request for data associated with the parcel, wherein the parcel is associated with the recognized text string. The request is for shipping data, which can include, but is not limited to tracking information, time in transit information, address validation information, shipping label generation data, or rate information. The data is processed by the computer according to the selected action, and is pasted into a document opened on a desktop of the computer, displayed in a message window on a desktop of the computer, and/or stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for obtaining shipping information from a remote source comprises a computer usable medium having computer readable program code that recognizes a predefined text string in a document or file being operated on by the software application and for which one or more predefined actions can be invoked, computer readable program code that generates a request for shipping information associated with an text string from a remote source in accordance with a selected action, and computer readable program code that processes the shipping information by the second software application in accordance with the selected action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method for obtaining shipping information comprises providing a software add-in module configured for installation in connection with a software application, wherein the add-in module is configured to recognize a predefined text string in a document or file being operated on by the software application and for which one or more predefined actions can be invoked, and generate a request for the shipping information associated with an text string at a remote sever in accordance with a selected action.

It will also be understood that each block of the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems that perform the specified functions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention enables customers of parcel carriers to access shipping information pertaining to the shipment of parcels without having to perform numerous steps such as launching new applications on their desktop, inputting data, copying/pasting data, etc. The present invention enables a user to automatically access shipping information located on a remote server. The user merely selects an action associated with a text string either recognized by a Microsoft Office smart tag or highlighted by user. The actions from which to select include tracking, time in transit, shipping history, label generation, address validation, proof of delivery and rate and service selection. The present invention automatically cuts the necessary text, opens or accesses databases, files, applications, websites, etc., to obtain the desired shipping information and then processes the data retrieved (including cutting, pasting, inserting or manipulating data and initiating actions such as dialing a phone number, generating a label or sending an e-mail). Of particular note, the present invention can do this without leaving the application in which a user is working, such as Microsoft Excel, Word or Outlook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention can utilize Microsoft smart tags to automatically recognize words, phrases, numbers and patterns in a Microsoft Excel, Word or Outlook document. For example, a tracking number, postal code or a proper name having a particular pattern can be recognized. Smart tags work in a similar manner to that of the spell check feature in Microsoft Word by adding intelligence to applications to flag mistakes or automatically change them. With smart tags, however, an identified text string is flagged with some sort of visual indication (e.g., a notice information icon) because it is of interest or needs some kind of attention. The smart tag application utilizes recognizer to identify certain text strings having particular patterns, such as a tracking number, proper name, and postal code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The user can then left-click on the visual indicator with their mouse to reveal one or more optional action to be conducted based on the recognized text string. In an alternative embodiment, the user highlights the text string of interest and then select a toolbar command or menu item custom designed for the present invention that provides for substantially the same action as the smart tags. This embodiment is particularly useful when the text string of interest is unique to that customer and the generally deployed add-in for smart tags would not include a recognizer for that text string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Once the action has been selected, the present invention executes the action by copying the recognized or highlighted text string (and possibly other related data associated with the user or customer) and preparing the appropriate request for data in accordance with the selected action. This may include launching other applications such as a web browser or accessing databases or files located within a local network (e.g., LAN) or an external network (e.g., the internet). The retrieved shipping information is then processed for presentation to the user, such as by pasting the information in the document in which the text string was identified or by presenting the information in a message box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> implementing an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The illustrated embodiment of the present invention delivers its functionality to customers via an add-in software module (hereinafter &ldquo;add-in&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The add-ins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are installed on a customer devices <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may comprise a desktop computer, PDA, telephone, or any other messaging or communication device with sufficient resources to support communications with other devices via a communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment comprises the internet, though it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may comprise a public switch telephone network (PSTN), local area network (LAN), cellular or satellite network, cable network, or any other suitable communications network, alone or in combination with one another and the Internet. Accordingly, the customer devices <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are able to communicate with a customer server/database <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and/or a carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises software code which can be installed in connection with a client-based application operating on customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as a plug-in, COM object, Active X Control, or DLL installed in connection with Microsoft Office. The add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be provided and installed from a computer readable medium such as a diskette, CD, flash card (or the equivalent), or downloaded via the communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from a remote location, such as the carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Depending on the functionality desired, the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be invoked as a smart tag function or as an enhanced toolbar/menu command or icon. Stated differently, the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can utilize the functionality of smart tags as the interface for recognizing text strings automatically and/or may add one or more customized icons (i.e., commands) to the toolbar or items to the menu bar of the application(s) to which it is installed. In either case, the execution of the selected actions on the identified text is substantially the same regardless of whether the action is selected from a smart tag option list or by selecting a customized toolbar icon or menu item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The customer server(s) and/or database(s) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be associated with one or more customers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as part of a single company&apos;s network. In this regard, certain shipping information may be stored remote to the customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> but within the company&apos;s network. For example, a company may have numerous customer devices <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> distributed throughout a geographic area, all with substantially equal access to shipping information for the company stored on a single or multiple servers and/or databases <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An example of such configuration is the UPS WorldShip&reg; software solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may access a remote carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to obtain shipping information stored on one or more databases <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which are accessible via one or more web/database servers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In this context, the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates and sends a request to the carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via communications network <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as by establishing an internet connection and sending an XML message. The request it is received and processed by the web/database server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which may include the retrieval of certain shipping information stored in the database(s) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The web/database server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> then prepares and sends a response back to the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as in the form of a web page or XML message. An example of such a carrier server is the UPS Online Tools, which is based on XML messaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flowchart of the operation of a system for obtaining shipping information in accordance with an embodiment in the present invention is provided. It is assumed for purposes of the following discussion that an add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention has been installed on a customer device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to operate in accordance with the following methodology. In the embodiment described, an add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is installed into version of Microsoft Office XP for use with Office applications such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Outlook. It is well known in the industry that the installation can be performed by an executable file that installs the add-in, making the appropriate entries in the program registry and the necessary program code is loaded onto the customer device. Once installed, at block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a text string is either recognized automatically by the smart tag feature of Microsoft Office or the user selects a text string such as by highlighting the text string with the cursor. In the case of the former, the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes recognizers defined to identify text strings of interest, such as a tracking number, which have a certain pattern such as &ldquo;1ZX . . . X.&rdquo; The recognized text string is identified by a distinctive visual marking, such as a notice information icon <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Alternatively, in the case of the latter, the text string is selected by the user, such as by highlighting the text string. This may be particularly advantageous with reference number tracking where a unique number (such as an account number) is given a parcel or group of parcels by the customer and the carrier tracks that number. Since the reference number may be different for each customer, it would be impractical if not impossible to build a smart tag recognizer suitable for all users. Therefore, in such circumstance, it is desirable to allow the user to select the text string, such as the text string <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with selectable actions via the smart tag notice information icon drop down menu, such as the menu <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, or customized toolbar icons or menu bar items such as toolbar icons <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The tool bar icons and/or menu bar items are generated by the add-in <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon installation, and may be selected by the user for invoking a certain action on the selected (e.g., highlighted) text. The user then selects a desired action from those available. In the case of the smart tag implementation, the actions presented to the user are preferably based upon the text string recognized. For example, if the text string recognized is a shipping number, the selectable actions presented to the user are limited to those appropriate for a shipping number. Examples of some of the selectable actions include tracking, time and transmit, shipping history, label generation, proof of delivery, address validation, signature tracking, and rate and service selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Once the user selects an action, the add-in executes the action. For purposes of the present discussion, the user requests an action that requires the add-in to access information that is remotely located, such as the MyUPS.com server and database. However, in accordance with the present invention, the action selected by the user may require access to data maintained within a company&apos;s network, such as data stored at a UPS WorldShip database. The present invention can also be extended to include access to contact list or other data maintained local to the customer device. Thus, at block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the add-in creates an appropriate request for executing the desired action. In the case of the embodiment discussed herein, this includes the creation of a message that includes information required by the carrier server to access the shipping information located at carrier server <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, the request may include security and identity information necessary to access the data as well as the identified text string or a portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the request is sent to the carrier servers utilizing appropriate security and data compression protocols. At the carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the request is processed and a response is generated and sent to the customer device. The carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> functions such as authentication, reporting, tracking, and message rejection are performed as appropriate. At block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the message from the carrier server is received by the customer device and the results are parsed out for display of the shipping information to the user. This also includes, where appropriate, error messaging due cause by the user, system or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Lastly, at block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the parsed results from the carrier server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are presented to the user in one or more of a variety of ways. For example, the results may be inserted into the document or spreadsheet in which the text string was identified, as illustrated by insert <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the results may be presented as a message box, as illustrated by message box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In addition, the results may be stored locally on the customer device or the customer server/database <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If the user is working in a Microsoft Word document, the results may be pasted at the end of the document or immediately after the text block in which the text string was identified. If the text string was identified in a table, then the results may be pasted in the same table cell as the identified text string. If the user is working in an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, then the results may be fanned in a single row from left to right or fanned down from top to bottom, in respective cells in either case. In addition, formatting may be added, such as column or row headings. If the user is working in Microsoft Outlook, then the results may be pasted at the end of the document or immediately after the text block in which the text string was identified. </paragraph>
