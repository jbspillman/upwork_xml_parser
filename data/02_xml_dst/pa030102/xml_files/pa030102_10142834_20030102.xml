<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> EEG </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electroencephalography is a non-invasive investigative technique, which finds application, inter alia, in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of mental illness. A conventional electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a recording of a time varying potential corresponding to brain electrical activity, can be detected and recorded using electrodes placed in proximity to the scalp of a human subject. The complementary technique of magnetoencephalography (MEG) similarly measures the magnetic signals emitted by the brain </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> ERP </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Event related potentials (ERPS) reflect the variations in brain electrical activity deriving from physiological processes which are associated with the occurrence of some definable event, or psychological process, such as a movement or an external stimulus. Similarly event related fields (ERFS) reflect the variations in brain magnetic activity associated with such an event. ERPs are conventionally extracted from EEG data, in which they are embedded, by a procedure known as &ldquo;averaging&rdquo;. Single sweep ERPs may also be recorded and analyzed, without using averaging. In this document the term ERP is used for either method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While the averaged ERP waveform is often treated as an entity in its own right, it should be noted that it is only a convenient representation of more complex entities. The averaged ERP is derived from variations in ongoing brain electrical activity. These variations in ongoing activity are in turn believed to be physiological manifestations of cognitive processes in response to a stimulus. While a method for modifying and acquiring an ERP waveform by producing a modified response is primarily described in the disclosed process, the production of modified physiological activity or modified cognitive states is equally a valid description of the result of this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> TMS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Direct stimulation of the brain was first demonstrated with exposed portions of the cortex. Trans-cranial stimulation seeks to produce similar effects through an intact skull. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> High voltage, single pulse, percutaneous electrical stimulation of the human motor cortex has been used since 1980 (Merton P. A. and Morton H. B. (1980), &ldquo;Stimulation of the cerebral cortex in the intact human subject&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>285, pp227). Anodal voltages of about 150V are applied at the vertex with a cathode to one side. Evidence of effect includes MAPs and phosphenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Trans-cranial stimulation of the cortex seeks to produce electrical currents in the cortex, sufficient to alter the operation of localized neurons. Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is implemented by passing a time varying electric current through a coil held close to the head. The resultant magnetic field passes through the skull, and induces a small secondary current in the cortex, which probably leads to depolarisation of cortical neurons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The progress from single magnetic pulses to rapid repetitive Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) was a logical development. Behavioral effects have been demonstrated with depression (Pascual&mdash;Leone et al., 1994b: Hoflich et al., 1993: George et al., 1995). and schizophrenia (Grisaru et al., 1994). None of these processes is dependent upon the current electrophysiological activity, nor utilises the immediate effects of stimulation on the electrophysiological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Terminology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;brain wave state&rdquo; as used in this document refers to spatio-temporal patterns of brain physiological activity, such as the patterns of brain electrical activity revealed by an EEG recording, and/or patterns of brain magnetic activity as revealed by an MEG recording. These patterns are similar in concept to the microstates as described by Lehman et al. 1987 (&ldquo;EEG alpha map series: brain micro-states by space orientated adaptive segmentation&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol., </italic></highlight>67 271-288.), although the specific implementation may vary. The microstate description is simply the closest current electrophysiological concept to the BWS. In concept, the BWS is assumed to represent a distinct brain state, as vaguely used in cognitive psychology, although the process does not rely on this feature. The brain wave states as used herein are preferably less then one second in is duration although longer states may be useful for particular applications, for example in detecting drowsiness. In practice. the BWS is simply a short-term pattern of brain waves (EEG/MEG) identified by PR techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; and &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; are, for clarity of presentation, used for inputs at different stages of the process. The differences in physical parameters of each input, however, are not critical. The purpose of the stimulus within the process is however critical. A modifying pulse is intended to predictably modify the subsequent brain-wave-state. A response-inducing stimulus is intended to produce a modified electrophysiological feature for further analysis. While the preferred implementation uses TMS as a modifying pulse, and auditory tones as a response-inducing stimulus, alternative implementations are also detailed. While in this embodiment all pulses and stimuli are externally generated, that is not a requirement of the process. The process could use endogenous input as either a modifying pulse or a response-inducing stimulus, provided such an input was reliably identified, and precisely measured in time. Similarly the brain wave state pattern recognition criteria are of two types. Modification criteria, and response criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The terms brain wave state, and ERP as used in this document require special clarification. They each arose from different fields of research as discussed earlier. They are used, for convenience of presentation, in different ways and at different stages of the process. They are likely to have slightly different parameters (e.g. 300 milliseconds for ERP and 1000 millisecond for brain-state), and to have different connotations (e.g. ERP usually averaged, brain-state is usually not in response to stimulus). However, it should be clearly noted that electrophysiologically they are the same. Both represent a brief pattern of electromagnetic radiation from the brain as a result of various physiological processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Prior Art ERP </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The article entitled &ldquo;P300 clinical utility and control of variability&rdquo; (Polich 1998, <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Neurophysiol</italic></highlight>) is an example of the use of the standard ERP process. No modifying pulse is applied, and the response-inducing stimulus is applied at random within set ISI limits. The response-inducing stimulus is again an auditor, target (2000 Hz) or non-target (1000 Hz). Although the response inducing stimulus is similar, and inter stimulus intervals may be similar, the standard process makes no attempt to modify the brain wave state and applies response inducing stimuli without regard to the current brain wave state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Goodin 1990 (&ldquo;Clinical utility of long latency &lsquo;cognitive&rsquo; event related potentials (P3): the pros&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol.</italic></highlight>) analyzed certain patient studies conducted during the 1980s, and found that there were discrepancies amongst the studies regarding the sensitivity of the P3 (or P300). This author observed that this may relate to differences in the method of eliciting the P3 response, variability in the severity of dementia among the patients studied and the fact that some patients do not generate a recognizable or reproducible response. Furthermore inattention can, even in normal subjects, result in either a small or absent P3 response. Goodin concludes that a high rate of absent or non-reproducible P3 responses will detract from its clinical utility and that this rate differs widely between investigators. This work thus identifies several consequences of ERP studies that are based on stimuli that are applied in non-optimal brain wave states. These include lower amplitude, longer latency, and treater variability of single sweep responses. The report makes no suggestions, however, as to how these shortcomings may be overcome. The interactive ERP detailed next was a development that addressed several of the reported problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> EEG/ERP correlates of cognitive function have been studied in neuropsychology (Pritchard, W. S. (1981) Psychophysiology of P300. <highlight><italic>Psychological Bulletin, </italic></highlight>89(3), 506-540. The current state of this art is best shown by Gevins et al.1995 (&ldquo;Mapping cognitive brain function with modem high resolution electroencephalography.&rdquo; <highlight><italic>TINS </italic></highlight>18(10) pp429-436. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Prior Art Interactive ERP (IERP) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In ERP studies the important assumptions are identical stimuli, reproducible responses to a particular randomly applied stimulus and random stationary background EEG activity that is not correlated with the ERP. Several authors have questioned the assumption of independence of the ERP and background EEG, including Basar et al. 1984 (&ldquo;A new approach to endogenous Event Related Potentials in man: Relation between EEG and P300 wave&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Intern. J. Neuroscience, </italic></highlight>24 (Suppl.1) 1-21) and Squires &amp; Donchin 1976 (&ldquo;Beyond averaging: The use of discriminant functions to recognize event related potentials elicited by auditory stimuli&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol., </italic></highlight>41 449-459). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Various models have described the endogenous potentials, for example the P300 wave, as a dynamic change in the EEG activity already present (Stampfer 1988, &ldquo;An analysis of preparation and response activity in P300 experiments in humans&rdquo;, in Basar and Melnechuk (Eds.), <highlight><italic>Dynamics of sensory and cognitive processing by the brain </italic></highlight>(1st Edition). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 276-286. and Wright et al. 1990 &ldquo;Inverse filter computation of the neural impulse giving rise to the auditory evoked potential&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Brain Topography, </italic></highlight>2 293-302). A number of authors have previously described effects of pre-stimulus brain wave state, specifically alpha waves, on the ERP, Jasiukaitis &amp; Hakerem 1988 (&ldquo;The effect of pre-stimulus alpha activity on the P300<highlight><italic>&rdquo;, Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol, </italic></highlight>25 (Suppl. 2) 157-65) found that larger amplitude P300s were obtained in the high alpha ERP. Stampfer 1988 (supra) reports on an increase in alpha phase alignment with the onset of stimulus, but does not correlate this increase with resulting averaged amplitude. Jansen &amp; Brandt, 1991 (&ldquo;The effect of the phase of pre-stimulus alpha activity on the averaged visual evoked potential&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol, </italic></highlight>80 241-250) carry out this correlation of alpha phase with amplitude for a visual evoked response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> These previous studies selected EEG data retrospectively for further analysis, However, the P300 and long latency potentials in general can be affected by a large number of factors other than background EEG, such as the ordering of preceding stimuli, the inter stimulus interval (ISI), refractory periods and habituation effects. Accordingly, such retrospective selection leads to difficulties in obtaining a data set balanced for all factors other than the variable under test. The interactive ERP (&ldquo;The effect of Pre-Stimulus alpha activity on the auditory P300 paradigm: a prospective study&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Brain Topography, </italic></highlight>9(3) 169-176) detailed a way of addressing this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Australian Patent Application No. 39994/97 in the name of Price discloses the &ldquo;interactive ERP&rdquo; (IERP) system for acquiring event related potentials (ERPs) based on the background EEG. This interactive measurement system is essentially a passive probe, with information being derived from the analysis of naturally occurring brain wave patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Conceptually the IERP process is a methodology distinct from both EEGs and ERPS. The process provides new information that is simply not obtainable by the EEG or standard ERP processes. This information, how the ERP interacts with the brain wave state of the EEG, has the potential utility of any new measure in research and clinical practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In practice, however, it may at present be considered as an adaptation of die standard ERP technique. The major advantage of the IERP process (and hence of the disclosed process) over the standard ERP process is that it provides a means of modifying the feature of interest through superior theoretical support. The process has been shown to produce an IERP which is significantly different to the standard ERP for a particular brain wave state (&ldquo;The effect of Pre-stimulus alpha activity on the auditory P300 paradigm&rdquo;, Price G. W., 1997, Brain Topography). In addition, the IERP has increased scientific validity as the background EEG in the typical standard ERP consists of varying length periods of several brain wave states, the resulting standard ERP is the result of an uncontrolled mixture of ERPs to each brain wave state. The IERP process allows the investigation of a pure (based on a single brain wave state) ERP, instead of a mixture. The advantage is obtained by the process allowing the control of a variable (brain wave state) which has been shown to have an effect on the ERP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The article entitled &ldquo;Enhancement of visual evoked potentials by stimulation during low Pre-stimulus EEG stages&rdquo;, Rehn and Basar, 1996) makes an attempt to apply response inducing stimuli based on background EEG characteristics such as spectral content. These general characteristics are not, I believe, the same as the brain wave states used in the disclosed process. The Rehn and Basar process, in any case, makes no attempt to modify the background EEG characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The interactive ERP process has the difficulty of having to wait for a requisite brain wave state to occur by chance. If a brain wave state being investigated, has a particularly low incidence by chance, then the interactive ERP process may not be able to operate effectively. Either a large inter stimulus interval, or a low number of stimuli will prevent a representative ERP from being generated. The present invention, overcomes that problem by artificially modifying the brain wave state, to increase the incidence of the requisite state, either as an end in itself, or prior to interactive ERP recording. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Prior Art TMS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,453 in the name of Cadwell discloses a method for magnetically stimulating neural pathways of a human, and also a method of generating ERPs based on these stimuli. The method disclosed however, delivers stimuli at random, or at a predetermined stimulus rate, and takes no account of the background brain wave state. The present invention takes account of the background EEG state before initiating stimuli. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Prior Art Various </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Other relevant prior art known to use techniques similar to ERP exists in the fields of biofeedback, photic driving, &ldquo;conditioning stimuli&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-generated ERPS&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Biofeedback in the ERP context is a field in which a feedback stimulus is applied after a standard ERP has been generated and analyzed. The process differs from the current process in three ways, The modification is very indirect being via some form of cognitive involvement. The modification is directed at the response, rather than the pre-stimulus brain wave state. The modification is applied, and evaluated, over large time frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Photic driving, or &ldquo;entrainment&rdquo; is an EEG related field in which a regular repetitive stimulus is applied to produce a desired periodic brain wave state, irrespective of the pre-existing brain wave state. This entrained (usually alpha frequency) signal provides general information about the response of a periodic brain waveform to a regular periodic stimulus. The information provided during entrainment is conceptually different to the single brain wave response to a single stimulus form of information provided by an ERP. The information is distributed over many cycles of the response, is limited to characteristics of a given periodic signal, and most importantly the information is limited to brain wave states which have been shown to respond to photic driving, such as alpha waves. A refinement to this method is to use information from an existing periodic waveform to synchronize the stimulating waveform with the brain waves of the subject such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,967 in the names of Yasushi and Saito. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Self-generated ERPs are event-related potentials generated in response to the subjects own stimulus marker typically a button press. No external stimulus is provided, and the subject is required to initiate the stimulus when in a selected mental state. Mental state, however, is not necessarily the same as brain wave state and is dependent on a subjective judgement by the patient. In addition, there is no modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In conditioning stimulus paradigms, a conditioning stimulus (CS) is applied in order to force the subject into a required mental state before the application of the operative imperative stimulus (IT). It differs from the current process in that both stimuli are applied at random. Neither CS nor IS are based on the actual brain wave state. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In one form, although it need not be the only or indeed the broadest form, the invention resides in a process for modifying a particular electrophysiological feature generated in response to a stimulus. While this feature is naturally modified by quasi-random variations in the pre-stimulus brain wave state, the disclosed process artificially induces an identified pre-stimulus brain wave state so as to predictably modify the response feature. Artificial modification of the pre-stimulus brain wave state is carried out by application of a modifying pulse, in this instance a Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulus (TMS) pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The essential feature of the process is the artificial production of an identified brain wave state prior to the application of a response-inducing stimulus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the pre-selected criteria are representative of a brain wave state associated with a particular illness or disability. The process is then used to analyze how such a BWS modifies the resulting response feature.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Preferably the response criteria in this step are different to the modifying criteria in Step1C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the step of applying the response-inducing stimulus may be selected from applying one or more of an auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactual, or somatosensory stimuli analogous to those currently used in ERP studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the response-inducing stimulus may be a final TMS/TES pulse intended to evoke a single response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the step of applying a pre-selected stimulus may include the step of selecting the stimulus, from a range of available stimuli, in accordance with the brain wave activity of the subject recorded in a previous cycle or step. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the final modifying pulse (Step1C) can be considered as the response-inducing stimulus. In this alternative, the final modified brain wave state is considered as the response feature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, several modifying pulses (Step1) may be needed before the predicted brain wave state modification is achieved, and a response-inducing stimulus can be applied. In this alternative, modifying pulses that do not lead to a BWS matching the response criteria are considered as ineffective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a series of modifying pulses may be needed to modify the brain wave state via a predictable sequence of intermediate brain wave states. In this alternative, a modifying pulse that does not lead directly to a response stimulus is still considered effective if a predicted modification of the BWS is achieved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each cycle of the process begins with the same initial values for modifying pulse, modifying criteria response inducing stimulus, and response criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, initial values may be varied for each cycle, based on either brain wave state information (learning), or on independent parameters such as recording time or stimulus count. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, where the putative brain wave state is undetectable, or unidentified, or unidentifiable, the response feature may be characterized by the processing of non-electrophysiological data. Such data may be behavioural (e.g. reaction time), clinical (e.g. rating scales) or subjective (e.g. self-report scales). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Whilst the &ldquo;interactive-modified interactive&rdquo; ERP (IMIERP) method of the invention can be readily applied to many types of electrophysiological investigation of the brain, the particular system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is arranged for the conduct of an investigation into the P300 peak generated in an auditory oddball paradigm (supra). Thick lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are intended to indicate data flow (usually multi channel), while thin lines represent control information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The system includes an array of fourteen electrodes (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) disposed in substantially the standard 10-20 (minus F<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, FP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and OI) arrangement at respective sites on the scalp of a subject (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). All electrode sites are referenced to earlobes (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the subject <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a around lead (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is used. Thus sixteen analogue signal lines feed into the normally closed relays (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The signals from the electrodes feed from the relay unit (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), to the amplification and filtering stage (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) before being passed (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) to the Brain Atlas (BA) (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) where they are sampled and digitized. All signal channels have a nominal gain of 30,000, a lower band pass (&minus;3 dB attenuation) of 1 Hertz (Hz) and an upper band pass (&minus;3 dB attenuation) of 30 Hz, the values set by the BA control lines (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). The digitized EEG data is then displayed as a continuous amplitude-time graph (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The amplified and filtered signals are also passed (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), undigitized, by the BA to the MONITOR computer (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). The MONITOR (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) controls the process by repeatedly executing two loops, the modifying loop, and the response loop. In both loops, DATA is generated and sent (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) to the TEMPMATC computer (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). TEMPMATC converts the EEG data into a string of primitives based on given criteria. These are passed (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) to the PARSING computer (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) to see if syntactic analysis criteria are met. The result (STIM) of the combined pattern recognition stage is passed (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) back to MONITOR (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). If STIM is False, the pattern recognition stage of the loop is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> If Stim is true, and MONITOR is in the modifying loop, a signal is sent (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to disconnect the relay unit (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) so that the amplifiers (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) are not saturated by a TMS pulse. A signal is also sent (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to the Magstim unit (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). This unit delivers a TMS pulse through the coil (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). Relays are reconnected, The process then begins the response loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> If Stim is true and MONITOR is in the response loop. A signal, plus information on the type of stimulus, is then sent (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) to the STIMULUS computer (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). STIMULUS then delivers a Target or Non-target auditory (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) or visual (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) stimulus to the headphones (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) or VDU (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). In the embodiment the selected stimulus comprises an auditory stimulus, although it will be apparent to those with skill in the art that one or more of a visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactual, somatosensory or electromagnetic stimuli may be employed. The stimulus computer may also log responses, such as reaction time (as reflected in an optional button-press provided for the subject). MONITOR also sends a signal (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) to Brain Atlas (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) so that a stimulus marker is added to the recorded EEG. The process then begins the modifying loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> MONITOR also does various ancillary tasks. Selection between modification or response processes, and associated TEMPMATC or PARSING criteria is controlled via process control lines (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). MONITOR first selects the type of stimulus. MONITOR controls the number of stimuli delivered. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The Flow chart <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> represents the steps outlined in the invention disclosure. The modifying and Response process inputs are separated for conceptual clarity, although technically they are carried out in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The final decision point is used to control the length of a recording session or block which in the embodiment is determined in terms of a desired number of ERP sweeps.

<heading lvl="1">REPRESENTATIVE APPLICATION OF THE PROCESS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> This investigation, which is an exemplary application for the method of the embodiment of the IMIERP process, compares the amplitude of the P300 peak of the standard ERP method (which does not take account of pre-stimulus brain electrical activity), with that of the IMIERP method of the embodiment (which initiates the stimulus when brain electrical activity meets pre-selected criteria). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The P300 peak is defined as the largest positive peak occurring at the Pz scalp location in the period from 280 to 500 milliseconds (ms) from the application of the stimulus. See Polich et al. 1985 (&ldquo;Effects of ace on the P300 component of the event related potential from auditory stimuli: Peak definition, variation and measurement&rdquo;. <highlight><italic>Journal of Gerontology, </italic></highlight>40(6) 721-726) and see also Polich 1991 (&ldquo;P300 in clinical applications&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Am. J. EEG Technol. </italic></highlight>31 201-231) in relation to the standard auditory oddball paradigm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A simple auditory oddball paradigm is utilized in the investigation, with frequent stimuli which the subject is asked to ignore and infrequently occurring &ldquo;oddball&rdquo; stimuli for which the subject is asked to keep a mental count The frequent tone was of 500 Hz frequency at 60 dB nHL. The infrequent stimuli was a tone of 2000 Hz at 60 dB nHL. The stimuli were step function tones with 5 millisecond rise time and 40-millisecond duration. The infrequent tone comprised 25% of the stimuli presented in a pseudo random fashion. The random sequence was adjusted to ensure no more than three consecutive target &ldquo;oddball&rdquo; tones would be generated. Both Target and Non-target tones were applied using the IMIERP process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A series of event-related response recordings were obtained using the IMIERP process. At the same session, subsequent to each of these recordings, a series of &ldquo;placebo&rdquo; responses were also obtained using the standard ERP methodology. The stimulus sequence and inter stimulus interval sequence of these placebo recordings was however, identical to the preceding IMIERP recording. This allowed a direct comparison of the IMIERP process with the standard process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The modifying pulse was applied when the brain wave state met modification criteria embodied in syntactic analysis grammar named AKTMSO3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The response-inducing stimulus was applied when the brain wave state met response criteria embodied in a syntactic analysis grammar named AKTERPO3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The target and non-target responses were averaged separately to extract the electrophysiological response. In addition, the non-averaged single sweep responses were identified manually. The sets of responses obtained using the IMIERP process were compared with those obtained using the standard process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The IMERP and Standard responses were compared as groups using a t-Test. The data showed the IMIERP amplitude values were significantly higher than those of the Standard recording (t&equals;2.04, df&equals;1, p&equals;0.046). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> For a non-parametric Sign Test comparison, the responses to Targets from the IMIERP and Mapped recordings were linked. Wherever possible, equivalent stimuli were matched as per the experimental design. In some cases an equivalent stimulus was not available due to artifact elimination in either recording, and a proximal stimulus (within 15 seconds ISI) was used In some cases where no equivalent or proximal stimulus was available, the stimulus was not matched, and was not used in these tests. The Sign test also showed that the amplitudes of the IMIERP recordings were significantly higher than those of the standard recordings (p&equals;0.109). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Since the P300 has use as a diagnostic tool the modification of this feature is seen as improving the diagnostic method. Similarly, as the P300 is linked by a large body of literature to cognitive processing, the modification of this feature is considered to be a modification of cognitive processing. The modification of this cognitive processing is therefore a means of treating or modifying undesired cognitive features. </paragraph>
