<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an ink-jet printer, and a recording method using the same, an ink cartridge used in the same, and ink-jet printer ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, the technical progress of a printer, especially, an ink-jet printer as a data output apparatus is remarkable with the wide use of a personal computer. Various type of ink-jet printers are marketed for various applications such as photograph quality and high-speed print like a laser printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Color ink cartridges and a black ink cartridge are generally prepared for the ink-jet printer. Thus, the print of a color image is possible, in addition to a monochromatic color print. In case of color print, the inks of three colors such as cyan, magenta and yellow are used as the color inks. Moreover, there is a case that ink of a light color is prepared in addition to these color inks. In any case, a plurality of color inks are generally piled up for color expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By the way, the demand of the bidirectional print has been rising recently for the improvement of the print speed. In a conventional ink-jet printer, a unidirectional print is adopted in which an ink-jet head is moved in a unidirection while ejecting ink drops. On the other hand, in the bidirectional print, the ejection of ink drops is carried out in a going way of the ink-jet head in a main scanning direction and a returning way in a direction opposite to the main scanning direction. In this case, almost twice of the print speed in the unidirectional print can be achieved in the bidirectional print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the ink-jet head generally has the structure in which the ejecting nozzles of the cartridges of the colors of black, cyan, magenta and yellow are aligned on a line. Therefore, when the color print should be carried out in a mixture color of two or more colors, there is a case that the coloring difference in the mixture color is caused between the going way and the returning way of the ink-jet head scanning. For example, it is supposed an ink set is comprised of black and three colors of cyan, magenta and yellow. In this case, blue color is formed by adhesion of an ink drop of cyan and an ink drop of magenta. When the ink drops are ejected in order of magenta and cyan in the going way, the ink drop of magenta is adhered to the surface of a paper sheet prior to the ink drop of cyan and stays on the surface of the paper sheet. For this reason, the ink of cyan goes around the ink drop of magenta and then soaks into the paper sheet. On the other hand, in the returning way of the ink-jet head, the order of the ejection nozzles is opposite with respect to the direction of the movement of the ink-jet head. Accordingly, the ink drops are ejected in order of cyan and magenta in the returning way. In this case, the ink drop of cyan is adhered on the surface of the paper sheet prior to the ink drop of magenta and stays on the surface of the paper sheet. For this reason, the ink of magenta goes around the ink drop of magenta and then soaks into the paper sheet. In either case, the ink adhered earlier has the tendency to color strongly. As a result, in the going way, the color of magenta is emphasized, and in the returning way, the color of cyan is emphasized. Thus, the coloring difference is recognized between the going way and returning way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the coloring difference is more conspicuous in a print paper sheet with large quality deviation rather than glossy fine paper sheet in which the ink absorption is uniform and quick. The elimination of the coloring difference in the bidirectional print is demanded in the business use in addition to the high-speed print and the large -amount print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the above-mentioned problem, an ink-jet printer is proposed in which the inks are arranged in order of the colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, yellow, magenta, and cyan to the direction of the movement of the ink-jet head. In this conventional ink-jet printer, the ejection order of the inks is made identical in the going way and the returning way. However, the ink cartridges for the multiple colors have to be arranged symmetrically with respect of the center of a row of ink cartridges, like the described above. Therefore, the ink-jet head becomes large-sized, compared with the conventional ink-jet head that the ink-jet cartridges of cyan, magenta and yellow are arranged, resulting in cost-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, an ink-jet printer is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 4-185452). In this reference, a printing operation is carried out in a going way, an ink-jet head is rotated by 180 degrees, and then the print operation is carried out in a returning way. In this method, the overall print operation time increase and a space has to be prepared in the printer, resulting in the large size of the printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As described above, various proposals were made for elimination of the coloring difference in the bidirectional print. However, because the structure of the printer is changed or the ejection method of inks is changed, it is difficult to incorporate the proposals in the existing printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with the above description, ink and a recording method using it are disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 6-157959). In this reference, the ink is comprised of water, coloring material dispersed or soluble in the water, wetting agent, and 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol. A recording operation is carried out on a paper sheet with Steckigt sizing degree of 3 sec. or more with the ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, ink and a recording method are disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-A-Heisei 8-193177). The ink is comprised of (A) coloring agent, (B) penetrant selected from three of Monohydric alcohol, derivative of Polyhydric alcohol, and interfacial active agent equal to or less than micell concentration, (C) alginate, (D) at least one kind of interfacial active agent selected from fluoric interfacial active agent and silicon interfacial active agent with a value of expanse T shown below, (E) wetting agent and (F) water. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T&equals;D/D</italic></highlight>0&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> where D is the diameter of a liquid drop of 0.05 wt % dropped on a paper sheet after 2 minutes, and D0 is the diameter of an ion exchange water drop dropped on a paper sheet after 2 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also, ink and a recording method are disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent application (JP-A-Heisei 11-207999). In a recording head, a plurality of nozzles to eject inks are arranged to the direction sending a printed medium as a sub scanning direction. Also, a group of the nozzles is arranged in a print direction as a main scanning direction on the printed medium. The sub scanning is carried out between a going way and a returning way. For color mixture print, first color ink is ejected and then second color ink is ejected and a quantity of the second color ink is less than a quantity of the first color ink. However, it is necessary to provide an additional function to control the ejection quantities of the color inks, resulting in cost-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, an ink-jet recording medium is disclosed in of Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-P2000-238414A). The ink-jet recording medium contains cationic resin in a range of cationic strength of 2 to 8 m equivalence/g as cationic residue equal to or more than 3 mmol/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Also, the ink-jet recording medium has a transfer quantity of 30 ml/m2 of distilled water to the recording medium measured by a dynamic scan absorption meter in the contact time of 10 ms. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an ink-jet printer using ink cartridges containing inks of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To solve the above coloring difference in the bidirectional print, the inventor of the present invention carried out an experiment about absorption of ink b when an ink drop b was ejected on a paper sheet which has absorbed an ink a, and absorption of the ink a when the ink drop a was ejected on the paper sheet which has absorbed the ink b. Consequently, it was found that there was a case that the absorption of the ink b is large or same in the paper sheet having absorbed the ink a, compared with the absorption of the ink b in the paper sheet having absorbed no ink. The same thing is true about the absorption of the ink a in the paper sheet having absorbed the ink b and the paper sheet having absorbed no ink. Also, it was found that the variance in the absorption of ink sometimes depended on the adhesion order of inks and sometimes did not depend on it. Moreover, it was found that difference in the absorption strongly depended on the combination of the paper sheet and the inks a and b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As a result, the inventor discovered that the coloring difference was difficult to be caused in the bidirectional print, depending on the combination of a paper sheet and the inks a and b, where there was not large difference in the absorption of the ink b between the paper sheet having absorbed the ink a and the paper sheet having absorbed no ink, and there was not large difference in the absorption of the ink a between the paper sheet having absorbed the ink b and the paper sheet having absorbed no ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As an example, a case that a blue color is produced will be described. The ink of magenta is first adhered to and absorbed in a paper sheet influences to the absorption of the ink of cyan in many cases. Also, the opposition is true. Accordingly, a combination of the ink of cyan and the ink of magenta is essential to prevent the coloring difference in the bidirectional print. In this combination, the ink of magenta is absorbed in the paper sheet as if the ink of cyan is not present even if the ink of cyan is present in the paper sheet, and the ink of cyan is absorbed in the paper sheet as if the ink of magenta is not present even if the ink of magenta is present in the paper sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention will be described more specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The absorption of ink in a paper sheet, which is important in the present invention, is represented in a concept of &ldquo;sizing degree&rdquo; in many cases. Methods such as a Steckigt method and a Bristow method are conventionally known for the evaluation of the sizing degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Of these methods, the Bristow method is a paper standard testing method in Japan. However, it was difficult to apply the Bristow method to the evaluation of the absorption of ink in an ink-jet printer, for the reasons that the method took a long time, and requires a large size of a test paper sheet piece. Especially, the method could not measure the speedy absorption of ink as in the ink-jet printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is possible to measure a correct absorption quantity of water in a short time in a dynamic scanning absorption meter (Japan TAPPI journal, Vol. 48, No. 5, page. 88), in which the above evaluation method is improved. In the absorption meter, a turntable can be turned around an axis and moved along the axis. The absorption meter can measure an ink absorption quantity by pushing a capillary containing an ink as a test object against a test piece of a paper sheet on the turntable while the test piece is spirally scanned, and by optically measuring a consumed ink quantity by a sensor. In the present invention, a dynamic scanning absorption meter (KM350-D1) commercially available from KYOWA SEIKO in Japan. The absorption meter has a first single capillary. In the present invention, a second capillary is added such that an ink from the second capillary overlaps on an ink line spirally drawn on a test piece of a paper sheet by an ink from the first capillary. The ink absorption quantity sensor is connected to the second capillary. Through this addition of the second capillary, it becomes possible to measure the absorption quantity of only the ink a and the absorption quantity of the ink b in the state in which the ink a is applied. Also, if the ink a and the ink b in the first and second capillaries are replaced, it becomes possible to measure the absorption quantity of only the ink b and the absorption quantity of the ink a in the state in which the ink b is applied. Also, by adjusting the distance between the first and second capillaries, the time period from when the ink a or b is ejected on the test piece to when the ink b or a is ejected on the test piece can be freely controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Instead of applying the first ink supplied from the first capillary on the paper sheet, the ink may be coated on the paper sheet with a wire bar, the paper sheet may be sunk in the ink, or the ink may be actually adhered by a printer. Thus, the above ink absorption quantity may be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The method of using two capillaries to apply inks imitates the situation which the ink b (or a) is applied immediately after the ink a (or b) is applied on a test piece. This method corresponds to an ink- jet printer with a short time between the going way and the returning way, i.e., a high-speed ink-jet printer of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that the time period from when the ink a (or b) is ejected from the first capillary to when the ink b (or a) is ejected from the second capillary is within 30 seconds. More preferably, it is within 10 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The following two matters were measured by using the above method: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Difference of the absorption quantity of the ink a when the ink a was applied in the state in which no ink was applied on a test piece, and the absorption quantity of the ink a when the ink a was applied in the state in which the ink b was applied on the test piece; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> difference of the absorption quantity of the ink b when the ink b was applied in the state in which no ink was applied on the test piece, and the absorption quantity of the ink b when the ink b was applied in the state in which the ink a was applied on the test piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, available ink will be described. The present invention can be applied to either of dye based ink and pigment ink. The dye based ink contains at least one kind of direct dye and acid dye as coloring material. The direct dye contains CI. direct yellow, CI. direct blue, CI. direct red and so on. The acid dye contains CI. acid yellow, CI. acid blue, CI. acid red and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As the coloring material of the pigment ink, materials can be used such as inorganic pigment, organic pigment (insoluble Azo pigment, soluble Azo pigment, phthalocyan pigment, Isoindolinon pigment, Quinacridorine pigment and Perylene pigment), for example. Also, processed pigment whose surface is processed with the solvent can be used. The containing quantity of the coloring material in the ink is preferably in a range of 1 to 10 wt % of a solid component, taking the stability of the ink, the depth of the print image, the blockage of the ink from a nozzle, and the spouting property into account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Also, as solvent for ink-jet printer ink, water-soluble organic solvent is exemplified in addition to ion exchange water. For example, the solvent can be used such as Alkyl alcohol ether with 1 to 4 carbons such as Methanol, Ethanol, N-propanol, Isopropanol, N-butanol, Sec-butanol, Tert-butanol, and Isobutanol, amid such as Dimethylholmiamid and Dimethylaccetamid, Ketone or Ketoalcohol such as Acetone and Diacetone alcohol, ether such as Tetrahydrofuran and Dioxane, polyalkylene glycol such as Polyethylene glycol, and Polypropylene glycol, alkylene glycol containing alkylene group with 2 to 6 carbons such as Ethylene glycol, Propylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, Thiodiglycol, and Hexylene glycol, and lower alkyl ether of polyhydric alcohol such as Glycerin, Ethylene glycol methyl ether, Diethylene glycol monomethyl (monoethyl) ether, and Triethylene glycol monomethyl (monoethyl) ether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, agents such as dispersion agent, interfacial active agent, viscosity conditioner, surface tension conditioner, pH conditioner, oxidation inhibitor, mildewproof agent, and chelating agent may be added according to need. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also, in the present invention, the L paper commercially available from Xerox was used as ink absorption paper. The ink absorption characteristic of the print paper was so far described. This is because it can be considered that print paper would be used for the high-speed print in the bidirectional printing system. The present invention can be applied widely in the practical use. The paper to be used is not limited to the print paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The inks a to e having the following compositions were produced from the above-mentioned ink materials. The difference in the above-mentioned absorption quantity between two of these inks, e.g., the inks a and b was measured when the contact time of the dynamic liquid absorption meter was 10 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Moreover, &ldquo;drawing patches&rdquo; were printed in a &ldquo;fine mode&rdquo; of an ink-jet printer (MJ-520) of SEIKO EPSON by exchanging ink cartridges such that the ink a was coated on the ink b and the ink b was coated on the ink a. Then, L*a*b*3 color values were measured in the condition of light source of D65, and the visual field angle of 2&deg;, using Spectrolino of GretagMacbeth Inc., and the coloring difference &Dgr;E between them was determined as a reference value. Here, the coloring differences were grouped into three groups. That is, the symbol &xcirc; indicates &Dgr;E&lt;2, the symbol &Dgr; indicates 2&lE;&Dgr;E&lE;3, and the symbol X indicates 3&lt;&Dgr;E.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Here, the difference in absorption quantity is a value when the contact time of the dynamic liquid absorption meter is 10 mS, and the unit is (ml/m2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Also, the column of &ldquo;&larr; absorption quantity difference&rdquo; indicates an absorption quantity difference relating to the ink written in the left column of the ink set, in other words, the difference between the absorption quantity of the ink when only the ink written in the left column of the ink set is applied, and an absorption quantity of the ink when the ink written in the left column of the ink set is applied in the condition that the ink written in the right column of the ink set is applied on the paper sheet. Also, the column of &ldquo;&rarr; absorption quantity difference&rdquo; is the absorption quantity difference relating to the ink written in the right column of the ink set, in other words, the difference between the absorption quantity of the ink when only the ink written in the right column of the ink set was applied, and an absorption quantity of the ink when the ink written in the right column of the ink set is applied in the condition that the ink written in the left column of the ink set is applied on the paper sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, &ldquo;&larr; absorption quantity difference&rdquo; of 3.4 in the first row of the table indicates a value (an absolute value) obtained by subtracting the absorption quantity of the ink a when the ink a is applied on an original paper sheet from the absorption quantity of the ink a when the ink a is applied on the paper sheet on which the ink b has been previously applied. Also, &ldquo;&rarr; absorption quantity&rdquo; of 12.4 indicates a value (an absolute value) obtained by subtracting the absorption quantity of the ink b when the ink b is applied on an original paper sheet from the absorption quantity of the ink b when the ink b is applied on the paper sheet on which the ink a has been previously applied. At this time, the coloring difference between them is consequently determined to be &Dgr; based on the criterion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> From the above result, it could be understood that the coloring difference in the bidirectional print is small in the ink set that the difference in the absorption quantity is both equal to or less than 10 (ml/m2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, only the ink sets of the limited combination of colors are described in the embodiments of the present invention. However, the present invention is not essentially limited to these colors and the inks. For example, the present invention can apply in a case where the black color is formed by mixing colors of cyan, magenta, and yellow without using independent black ink. Besides, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, the ink-jet printer of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ink-jet printer is comprised of a main control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a sub scan control section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a main scan control section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a print control section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a sub scan drive section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a main scan drive section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a ink-jet head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The ink-jet head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is comprised of a print drive section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and 3-color ink cartridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The main control section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> controls the operation of the ink-jet printer. The sub scan control section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> controls the sub scan drive section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to feed a print paper sheet. The main scan control section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> controls the main scan drive section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to move the ink-jet head in a direction of a going way and a direction of a returning way. The print control section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> controls the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in such a manner that ink drops are ejected from the ink cartridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the print paper sheet. The color inks of the present invention are filled in the ink cartridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this way, the bidirectional color print can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the coloring difference dependent on the difference of the piling order of the colors can be eliminated. Therefore, it becomes unnecessary to consider the piling order of inks in the print. The coloring problem can be solved without adopting a special structure in the printer and control of ejecting operation of the inks. In this way, the bidirectional print can be accomplished with low price, the high-speed operation and the high quality in the present invention. </paragraph>
