<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of ultrasonic imaging and an ultrasonic imaging apparatus for using ultrasonic waves in order to perform diagnosis of internal organs of living bodies or a non-destructive inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of a Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, an ultrasonic imaging apparatus including an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus and industrial flaw detector uses an ultrasonic probe including a plurality of ultrasonic transducers with the functions of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. The ultrasonic imaging apparatus with an ultrasonic probe uses a scanning line formed by combining ultrasonic waves to scan the objects in order to provide image data about an object to be inspected. In such an apparatus, two-dimensional or three-dimensional images of the object can be reproduced on the basis of the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In such an ultrasonic imaging apparatus, as for the method of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic beams using an ultrasonic probe, the following two methods described in (1) and (2) have been known. In addition, the design of ultrasonic beam is described in &ldquo;Digital Ultrasonic Technology&rdquo; by H. Kanda et al., a special issue of the Japanese Journal of Clinical Radiology, Vol. 43, No. 11, pp. 1248-1252, published in 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) Unidirectional ultrasonic beam transmission&mdash;Echo division receiving method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of ultrasonic beam transmitting states according to a conventional method. Likewise, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of ultrasonic beam receiving states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In this method, each of plural ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> included in an ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> transmits ultrasonic pulses intermittently in accordance with drive signals supplied by a plurality of pulsers connected to a transmitting section. This ultrasonic pulse is transmitted from the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the object to propagate through the object and form an ultrasonic beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. The ultrasonic beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> becomes narrower as it travels in the transmission source nearby area and narrowest at the focal point F, and thereafter diverges progressively. The ultrasonic beam is reflected by a reflector in the object to generate an echo. The ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, receives this echo. The detection signals output from the plural ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> included in the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> undergo a predetermined delay through a plurality of phase matching calculating units connected to a receiving section and they are added to each other to provide a detection signal for each received ultrasonic beam. In this example, three received ultrasonic beams <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are illustrated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this method, an ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is supplied with two or more kinds of drive signals, whereby a plurality of ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> included in the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are simultaneously supplied with more than one kind of drive signals by pulser sets. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, two sets of timing pulses composed of A-series pulses and B-series pulses are applied to one set of elements to generate both of an ultrasonic beam A and ultrasonic beam B. When the A-series pulses and the B-series pulses overlap one another, a common pulse is produced. These ultrasonic beams A and B are transmitted toward the object simultaneously in a plurality of directions, e.g. two directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For above-described ultrasonic diagnostic method and ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, it has been required to improve a frame rate and resolution in recent years. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the accompanying drawings, the embodiments of the invention will be described below in detail. In those drawings, the same components are identified by the same reference numeral with no description thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of an ultrasonic imaging apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention. This ultrasonic imaging apparatus is, for example, used as an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for the examination of human bodies or an industrial flaw detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ultrasonic imaging apparatus has an ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is used in contact with an object to be inspected. The ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a so-called two-dimensional array of transducers comprising a plurality, namely N&times;N&equals;N<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, of ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the functions of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves. In the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be arranged, for example, in the form of a two-dimensional matrix of N&times;N. The ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may include a piezoelectric device made out of the material such as PZT (lead zirconate titanate) or PVDF (polyvinyl difluoride). On applying a voltage, a piezoelectric device produces small mechanical vibrations to generate ultrasonic pulses. Contrarily, applying ultrasonic pulses across a piezoelectric device cause it to mechanically vibrate and generate an electrical signal (detection signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constituted by such piezoelectric devices used as ultrasonic transmitting devices and ultrasonic receiving devices such as Fabry-Perot resonators (hereinafter referred to as FPR) or fiber Bragg gratings, each formed at the tips of fine optical fibers. Although a two-dimensional array of transducers is used in this example, arrays other than such array, e.g. one-dimensional or one-and-a-half-dimensional array may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected with N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pulsers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each of the pulsers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is excited according to an output signal of an excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> incorporated in a system control section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which will be described below, and then outputs a drive signal to the corresponding ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each of the ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits an ultrasonic pulse to the object in accordance with a drive signal input from the corresponding pulser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and receives the ultrasonic pulse reflected by the object and outputs a detection signal. These pulsers are high-speed pulsers that can continuously output drive signals at a high repetition period (e.g. 3 MHz to 10 MHz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a preamplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, TGC (time gain compensation) amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The detection signals output from individual ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> undergo analog processing in the preamplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the TGC amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> included in the corresponding receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this analog processing, levels of the detection signals are matched to the input signal levels of respective analog-to-digital converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The analog signals output from the TGC amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are converted to digital signals (data) by the corresponding analog-to-digital converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The system control section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and an excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and controls the entire system of the ultrasonic imaging apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to the individual pulsers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the excitation timing controller outputs the signals for exciting the pulsers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> individually. In this embodiment, the excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is constituted by an electronic circuit but may be constituted otherwise, for example, by a pattern generator. Controlling the excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> enables excitation timing control for transmitting ultrasonic beams in a plurality of directions during the time interval between the emission of ultrasonic beams by the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and coming-back thereof as echoes from the maximum imaging depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected with the individual receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to store detection data output from the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in each receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> temporarily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> performs computations to match the phase of detection data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Although the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown in the form of one block in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of systems are provided corresponding to the number of receiving focal points. In addition, each of the plurality of systems in the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constituted by a shift resistor delay line, a digital micro-delay unit, a software, or the combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Now, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> performs received beam forming as follows. Each of the systems in the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> delays detection data produced in accordance with the detection signals output by the ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a predetermined delay time. As a result, two or more pieces of detection data produced by a series of ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> included in the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are matched in phase. In addition, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adds these pieces of detection data to each other in digital form. Thus, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having the plurality of systems enables simultaneous reception focusing in a plurality of directions within the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> carries out demodulation of detection waveforms, conversion to image data, a predetermined image processing and conversion of scan formats with respect to the data output from the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This makes it possible to convert image data in scanning line data spaces into physical space image data. In addition, the display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> obtains voxel data, which is data for a certain volume, from more than one piece of tomographic data and performs the calculations to display a three-dimensional image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to a monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives image data which have undergone scan format conversion in the display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, converts it to the analog signals through digital-to-analog conversion, and displays an image according to the resultant signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation of the ultrasonic imaging apparatus according to the embodiment is described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates a state in which two ultrasonic beams are transmitted from the ultrasonic imaging apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates a state in which the ultrasonic imaging apparatus receives echoes of ultrasonic beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> First, ultrasonic beams are transmitted in different directions from the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In other words, a plurality of pursers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> output continuous drive signals at a high repetition period, e.g. 3 MHz to 10 MHz, to the ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> included in the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> under control of the excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the system control section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At that time, ultrasonic pulses may be transmitted from all of N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or some of those transducers. In this embodiment, predetermined two sets of ultrasonic transducers belonging to the N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ultrasonic transducers transmit ultrasonic pulses toward a measurement target within the object with their phases shifted each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic pulses thus transmitted by two sets of the ultrasonic transducers form two transmitted ultrasonic beams <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an ultrasonic beam becomes narrower as it travels in the transmission source nearby area and narrowest at the focal point F, and thereafter diverges progressively. Therefore, it is desired that an operator appropriately operates the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the focal point F of an ultrasonic beam is located on the measurement target within the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic beams <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> simultaneously transmitted in two directions from the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are reflected by the measurement target within the object, so that the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives the echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> overlap one another when they are received by the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in the upper portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. A plurality of ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> output detection signals in accordance with the echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> received by the ultrasonic probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> undergo the reception focusing. In other words, the detection signals of echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> output by the ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are entered into their corresponding receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> respectively. In those receivers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the respective detection signals are subjected to the analog processing in the preamplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the TGC amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereof and matched to the input signal levels of the corresponding analog-to-digital converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The output analog signals from the TGC amplifiers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are converted into their digital equivalents in the corresponding analog-to-digital converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, stored in the memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> temporarily, and then entered into the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> performs the received beam forming based on a series of detection data produced on the basis of the echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> imparts a plurality sets of delays corresponding to the number of receiving focal points to a series of detection data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the received echo <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>a corresponding to a transmitted ultrasonic beam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can form a plurality of receiving focal points by using the series of detection data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In addition, the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adds each set of delayed data up in digital form. As a result, three echoes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be obtained from the echo <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to a transmitted ultrasonic beam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also performs the received beam forming so that the received echo <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to a transmitted ultrasonic beam <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can form a plurality of receiving focal points. Thus, three echoes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be obtained form the echo <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the number of image data obtained in one transmit/receive operation of ultrasonic beams is determined as follows. First, two types of detection signals are obtained by receiving the echoes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that correspond to ultrasonic beams <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmitted in two directions. Then, each type of signals is subjected to three different phase matching processes and divided into three varieties of data. Then, the number of image data is represented by the following expression:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(the number of directions of transmitted ultrasonic waves)&times;(the number into which an echo is divided)&equals;2&times;3&equals;6</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is possible to produce six types of image data in one transmit/receive operation of ultrasonic beams, which enables the improvement of frame rates by six times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a focal point cross section (receiving focal plane) of the received ultrasonic beams which has been subjected to the received beams forming as described above. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> plurality of focal points formed by the received beam forming are placed in the focal plane. Now a beam diameter on an ultrasonic beam receiving focal plane F after the receiving beam forming is indicated with D, and a distance between receiving focal point centers of ultrasonic beams is represented with L. To separate focal points in the receiving focal plane F, it is necessary to control the excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the system control section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to satisfy the requirement that L is greater than or equal to D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the excitation timing of excitation timing controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is controlled such that the distributions of two received ultrasonic beams P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> overlap one another in area where their sound pressures are at least 6 dB less than the sound pressure peak values of the received ultrasonic beams P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, preferably 20 dB or more less than the peak values, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. When the diameter of an ultrasonic beam is defined by a diameter at both ends of which an ultrasonic wave sound pressure become 6 dB or 20 dB less than the peak value thereof, a distance L between receiving focal point centers becomes larger than or equal to the sum of cross sectional diameters r of two ultrasonic beams P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. As a result, the ultrasonic beam P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are separated. Therefore, the cross talk is reduced when separating the echoes reflected back from two directions by reception focusing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The detection data, which have undergone the received beam forming in the phase matching calculating section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as described above, are subjected to detection of the detection waveform, conversion into the image data, predetermined image processing, and conversion of image data scan formats in the display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which converts image data in scanning line data spaces into physical space image data. In addition, the display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> produces voxel data, which is data for a certain volume, from a plurality pieces of tomographic data and also calculates to display a three-dimensional image. Results of the calculations in display image calculating section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are converted into corresponding analog signals in the monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> before displayed as images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Although it has been described that, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, ultrasonic beams are simultaneously transmitted in two directions, it is also naturally possible to transmit ultrasonic beams in more directions at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, simultaneously transmitting a plurality of ultrasonic beams in various directions increases the number of ultrasonic beam transmit/receive operations to be performed per unit time, which enables high frame rate imaging. In addition, the excitation timing is controlled such that the ultrasonic beam distributions concerning a plurality of receiving focal points at the time of beam reception overlap one another in an area where their sound pressures are at least 6 dB less than the sound pressure peak values of the received ultrasonic beams, preferably 20 dB or more less than the peak values, therefore, it is possible to reduce cross talk between a plurality of received ultrasonic beams and to provide image data with a high resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the invention it is possible to provide image data with a high frame rate or to improve resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been described, it is to be understood that modification and variation thereof may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
