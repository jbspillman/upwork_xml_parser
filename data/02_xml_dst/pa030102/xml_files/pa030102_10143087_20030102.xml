<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to integrated circuitry, and in particular to a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic family with enhanced speed characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For a number of reasons CMOS is the logic family of choice in today&apos;s VLSI devices. Due to the complementary nature of its operation, CMOS logic consumes zero static power. CMOS also readily scales with technology. These two features are highly desirable given the drastic growth in demand for low power and portable electronic devices. Further, with the computer aided design (CAD) industry&apos;s focus on developing automated design tools for CMOS based technologies, the cost and the development time of CMOS VLSI devices has reduced significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The one drawback of the CMOS logic family, however, remains its limited speed. That is, conventional CMOS logic has not achieved the highest attainable switching speeds made possible by modern sub-micron CMOS technologies. This is due to a number of reasons. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a conventional CMOS inverter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&mdash;the most basic building block of CMOS logic. A p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> switches between the output and the positive power supply Vcc, and an n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> switches between the output and the negative power supply (or ground). The switching speed in CMOS logic is inversely proportional to the average on resistance (Ron) of the MOS transistor, and the load capacitance C<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>on a given node (&tgr;&equals;Ron&times;C<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>). The on resistance Ron is proportional to the transistor channel length L divided by the power supply voltage (i.e., Ron &agr; L/Vcc), while the load capacitance is given by the gate capacitance of the transistor being driven (i.e., W&times;L&times;Cox, where Cox is the gate oxide capacitance), plus the interconnect parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>. Therefore, with reduced transistor channel lengths L, the switching speed is generally increased. However, this relationship no longer holds in sub-micron technologies. As the channel length L in CMOS technology shrinks into the sub-micron range, the power supply voltage must be reduced to prevent potential damage to the transistors caused by effects such as oxide breakdown and hot-electrons. The reduction of the power supply voltage prevents the proportional lowering of Ron with the channel length L. Moreover, the load capacitance which in the past was dominated by the capacitances associated with the MOS device, is dominated by the routing or interconnect capacitance (C<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>) in modern sub 0.5 micron technologies. This means that the load capacitance will not be reduced in proportion with the channel length L. Thus, the RC loading which is the main source of delaying the circuit remains relatively the same as CMOS technology moves in the sub-micron range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As a result of the speed limitations of conventional CMOS logic, integrated circuit applications in the Giga Hertz frequency range have had to look to alternative technologies such as ultra high speed bipolar circuits and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). These alternative technologies, however, have drawbacks of their own that have made them more of a specialized field with limited applications as compared to silicon MOSFET that has had widespread use and support by the industry. In particular, compound semiconductors such as GaAs are more susceptible to defects that degrade device performance, and suffer from increased gate leakage current and reduced noise margins. Furthermore, attempts to reliably fabricate a high quality oxide layer using GaAs have not thus far met with success. This has made it difficult to fabricate GaAs FETs, limiting the GaAs technology to junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) or Schottky barrier metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs). A major drawback of the bipolar technology, among others, is its higher current dissipation even for circuits that operate at lower frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore highly desirable to develop integrated circuit design techniques that are based on conventional silicon CMOS technology, but overcome the speed limitations of CMOS logic. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a new family of CMOS logic that is based on current-controlled mechanism to maximize speed of operation. The current-controlled CMOS (or C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS&trade;) logic family according to the present invention includes all the building blocks of any other logic family. The basic building block of the C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic family uses a pair of conventional MOSFETs that steer current between a pair of load devices in response to a difference between a pair of input signals. Thus, unlike conventional CMOS logic, C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic according to this invention dissipates static current, but operates at much higher speeds. In one embodiment, the present invention combines C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic with CMOS logic within the same integrated circuitry, where C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS is utilized in high speed sections and CMOS is used in the lower speed parts of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a current-controlled metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) circuit fabricated on a silicon substrate, including a clocked latch made up of first and second n-channel MOSFETs having their source terminals connected together, their gate terminals coupled to receive a pair of differential logic signals, respectively, and their drain terminals connected to a true output and a complementary output, respectively; a first clocked n-channel MOSFET having a drain terminal connected to the source terminals of the first and second n-channel MOSFETs, a gate terminal coupled to receive a first clock signal CK, and a source terminal; third and fourth n-channel MOSFETs having their source terminals connected together, their gate terminals and drain terminals respectively cross-coupled to the true output and the complementary output; a second clocked n-channel MOSFET having a drain terminal connected to the source terminals of the third and fourth n-channel MOSFETs, a gate terminal coupled to receive a second clock signal CKB, and a source terminal; first and second resistive elements respectively coupling the true output and the complementary output to a high logic level; and a current-source n-channel MOSFET connected between the source terminals of the first and second clocked n-channel MOSFETs and a logic low level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the circuit further includes a buffer/inverter made up of first and second n-channel MOSFETs having their source terminals connected together, their gate terminals respectively coupled to receive a pair of differential logic signals, and their drain terminals coupled to a high logic level via a respective pair of resistive loads; and a current-source n-channel MOSFET connected between the source terminals of the first and second n-channel MOSFETs and a low logic level, wherein, the drain terminal of the first n-channel MOSFET provides a true output of the buffer/inverter and the drain terminal of the second n-channel MOSFET provides the complementary output of the buffer/inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuitry that combines on the same silicon substrate, current-controlled MOSFET circuitry of the type described above for high speed signal processing, with conventional CMOS logic that does not dissipate static current. Examples of such combined circuitry include serializer/deserializer circuitry used in high speed serial links, high speed phase-locked loop dividers, and the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides ultra high-speed logic circuitry implemented in silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process technology. A distinction is made herein between the terminology &ldquo;CMOS process technology&rdquo; and &ldquo;CMOS logic.&rdquo; CMOS process technology as used herein refers generally to a variety of well established CMOS fabrication processes that form a field-effect transistor over a silicon substrate with a gate terminal typically made of polysilicon material disposed on top of an insulating material such as silicon dioxide. CMOS logic, on the other hand, refers to the use of complementary CMOS transistors (n-channel and p-channel) to form various logic gates and more complex logic circuitry, wherein zero static current is dissipated. The present invention uses current-controlled mechanisms to develop a family of very fast current-controlled CMOS (or C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS&trade;) logic that can be fabricated using a variety of conventional CMOS process technologies, but that unlike conventional CMOS logic does dissipate static current. C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic or current-controlled metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) logic are used herein interchangeably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the basic building block of this logic family is an NMOS differential pair with resistive loads. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown one embodiment for the basic C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a pair of n-channel MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> that receive differential logic signals D and D&num; at their gate terminals, respectively. Resistive loads <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> connect the drain terminals of MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, respectively, to the power supply Vcc. Drain terminals of MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> form the outputs OUT&num; and OUT of the inverter/buffer, respectively. Resistive loads <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be made up of either p-channel MOSFETs operating in their linear region, or resistors made up of, for example, polysilicon material. In a preferred embodiment, polysilicon resistors are used to implement resistive loads <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which maximizes the speed of inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The source terminals of n-channel MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> connect together at node <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A current-source n-channel MOSFET <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> connects node <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to ground (or negative power supply). A bias voltage VB drives the gate terminal of current-source MOSFET <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and sets up the amount of current I that flows through inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In response to the differential signal at D and D&num;, one of the two input n-channel MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> switches on while the other switches off. All of current I, thus flows in one leg of the differential pair pulling the drain terminal (OUT or OUT&num;) of the on transistor down to logic low, while the drain of the other (off) transistor is pulled up by its resistive load toward logic high. At the OUT output this circuit is a buffer, while at the OUT&num; output the circuit acts as an inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Significant speed advantages are obtained by this type of current steering logic. Unlike the conventional CMOS inverter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when either one of the input MOSFETs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is switching on, there is no p-channel pull-up transistor that fights the n-channel. Further, circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> requires a relatively small differential signal to switch its transistors. This circuit also exhibits improved noise performance as compared to the CMOS inverter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, since in the C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS inverter/buffer, transistors do not switch between the power supply and the substrate. Logic circuitry based on current-steering techniques have been known in other technologies such as bipolar, where it is called emitter-coupled logic (ECL), and GaAs where it is called source-coupled FET logic (SCFL). This technique, however, has not been seen in silicon CMOS technology for a number of reasons, among which is the fact that CMOS logic has always been viewed as one that dissipates zero static current. The C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic as proposed by the present invention, on the other hand, does dissipate static current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The design of each C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic cell according to the present invention is optimized based on several considerations including speed, current dissipation, and voltage swing. The speed of the logic gate is determined by the resistive load and the capacitance being driven. As discussed above, the preferred embodiment according to the present invention uses polysilicon resistors to implement the load devices. P-channel MOSFETs can alternatively be used, however, they require special biasing to ensure they remain in linear region. Further, the junction capacitances of the p-channel load MOSFETs introduce undesirable parasitics. Speed requirements place a maximum limit on the value of the resistive loads. On the other hand, the various C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic cells are designed to preferably maintain a constant voltage swing (I&times;R). Accordingly, the values for R and I are adjusted based on the capacitive load being driven to strike the optimum trade-off between switching speed and power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic family, according to the present invention, contains all the building blocks of other logic families. Examples of such building blocks include inverters, buffers, level shift buffers, N-input NOR and NAND gates, exclusive OR (XOR) gates, flip flops and latches, and the like. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exemplary C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS level shift circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Level shift circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes essentially the same circuit elements as inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with an additional resistor Rs <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> inserted between the power supply Vcc and the load resistors. Circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> operates in the same fashion as inverter/buffer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> except that it has its power supply voltage shifted by a value equal to (I&times;Rs). The C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic circuitry according to the present invention employs this type of level shifter to make the necessary adjustments in the signal level depending on the circuit requirements. Examples of C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS circuits utilizing this type of level shifting will be described below in connection with other types of C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show exemplary C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS implementations for an exemplary 2-input AND/NAND gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and an exemplary 2-input OR/NOR gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, respectively. These gates operate based on the same current steering principal as discussed above. A logic low signal at input B of AND/NAND gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> brings OUT to ground via Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while OUT&num; is pulled high by its load resistor. A logic low at the A input also pulls OUT to ground via Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (B&equals;high). OUT is pulled high only when both A and B are high disconnecting any path to ground. OUT&num; provides the inverse of OUT. OR/NOR gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> operates similarly to generate OR/NOR logic at its outputs. When another set of transistors are inserted in each leg of the differential pair as is the case for gates <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the signals driving the inserted transistors (Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) need level shifting to ensure proper switching operation of the circuit. Thus, high speed C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS level shifters such as those presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> can be employed to drive signals B and B&num;. In a preferred embodiment, since node OUT in both gates <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> must drive the additional parasitics associated transistors Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, dummy load transistors DQL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DQL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connect to node OUT&num; to match the loading conditions at both outputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an exemplary C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS implementation for a 2:1 multiplexer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Similar to the other C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic gates, multiplexer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a differential pair for each input, but multiplexer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> further includes select transistors <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> inserted between the common source terminals of the differential pairs and the current source transistor in a cascode structure. By asserting one of the select input signals SELA or SELB, the bias current is steered to the differential pair associated with that select transistor. Thus, signal SELA steers the bias current to the differential pair with A and A&num; inputs, and signal SELB steers the bias current to the differential pair with B and B&num; inputs. Similar to gates <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the signals SELA and SELB driving inserted transistors <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> need level shifting to ensure proper switching operation of the circuit. </paragraph>

Latch <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a first differential pair <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> that receives differential inputs D and D&num; at the gate terminals, and a second differential pair <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> that has its gate and drain terminals cross-coupled to the outputs of OUT and OUT&num; first differential pair <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>.

Similar to the other C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS gates that have additional transistors inserted between the differential pair and the current-source transistor, clock signals CK and CKB are level shifted by level shift circuits such as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS master-slave flip-flop <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can be made by combining two latches <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>.

The differential output signals QI and QI&num; are then applied to the differential inputs of a second latch <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. The differential outputs Q and Q&num; of second latch <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> provide the outputs of flip-flop <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Every one of the logic gates described thus far may be implemented using p-channel transistors. The use of p-channel transistors provides for various alternative embodiments for C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic gates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows one example of an alternative implementation for a C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS clocked latch <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> that uses p-channel transistors. In this embodiment, instead of inserting the n-channel clocked transistors between the common-source nodes of the differential pairs and the current-source transistor, p-channel clocked transistors <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> connect between the common-source nodes and the power supply Vcc. This implementation also requires that each differential pair have a separate current-source transistor as shown. Clocked latch <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> operates essentially the same as latch <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, except the implementation is not as efficient both in terms of size and speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by the various C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic elements described above, all of the building blocks of any logic circuitry can be constructed using the C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS technique of the present invention. More complex logic circuits such as shift registers, counters, frequency dividers, etc., can be constructed in C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS using the basic elements described above. As mentioned above, however, C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic does consume static power. The static current dissipation of C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS may become a limiting factor in certain large scale circuit applications. In one embodiment, the present invention combines C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic with conventional CMOS logic to achieve an optimum balance between speed and power consumption. According to this embodiment of the present invention, an integrated circuit utilizes C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic for the ultra high speed (e.g., GHz) portions of the circuitry, and conventional CMOS logic for the relatively lower speed sections. For example, to enable an integrated circuit to be used in ultra high speed applications, the input and output circuitry that interfaces with and processes the high speed signals is implemented using C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS. The circuit also employs C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS to divide down the frequency of the signals being processed to a low enough frequency where conventional CMOS logic can be used. The core of the circuit, according to this embodiment, is therefore implemented by conventional CMOS logic that consumes zero static current. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a simplified block diagram illustrating this exemplary embodiment of the invention. A C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS input circuit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> receives a high frequency input signal IN and outputs a divided down version of the signal IN/n. The lower frequency signal IN/n is then processes by core circuitry <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> that is implemented in conventional CMOS logic. A C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS output circuit <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> then converts the processed IN/n signal back to the original frequency (or any other desired frequency) before driving it onto the output node OUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An example of a circuit implemented using combined CMOS/C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS input circuitry <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is a deserializer that receives a serial bit stream at a high frequency of, for example, 2 GHz. A 2 GHz input clock signal CLK is divided down to 1 GHz using a C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS flip-flop <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, that is connected in a &divide;2 feedback configuration. The 1 GHz output of flip-flop <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is then supplied to clock inputs of a pair of C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS latches <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Latches <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, which may be of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, receive the 2 GHz input bit stream at their inputs and respectively sample the rising and falling edges of the input bit stream in response to the 1 GHz clock signal CLK/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The signal CLK/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is applied to the B/B&num; inputs of each latch (the level shifted input; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), samples the input data preferably at its center. It is to be noted that the rise and fall times of the signal in CMOS logic is often very dependent on process variations and device matching. C3MOS logic, on the other hand, is differential in nature and therefore provides much improved margins for sampling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus deserializes the input bit stream with its frequency halved to allow for the use of conventional CMOS logic to process the signals. The signals at the outputs of latches <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> are applied to parallel processing circuitry <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> that are implemented in conventional CMOS logic operating at 1 GHz. The reverse is performed at the output where a serializer <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> receives the output signals from processing circuitry <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and serializes them using C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic. The final output signal is a bit stream with the original 2 GHz frequency. Circuit applications wherein this technique can be advantageously be employed include high speed single or multi-channel serial links in communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, this technique doubles the amount of the core signal processing circuitry. However, since this part of the circuit is implemented in conventional CMOS logic, current dissipation is not increased by the doubling of the circuitry. Those skilled in the art appreciate that there can be more than one level of deserializing if further reduction in operating frequency is desired. That is, the frequency of the input signal can be divided down further by 4 or 8 or more if desired. As each resulting bit stream will require its own signal processing circuitry, the amount and size of the overall circuitry increases in direct proportion to the number by which the input signal frequency is divided. For each application, therefore, there is an optimum number depending on the speed, power and area requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention the combined C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS/CMOS circuit technique as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is employed in a transceiver of the type illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The exemplary transceiver of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is typically found along fiber optic channels in high speed telecommunication networks. The transceiver includes at its input a photo detect and driver circuit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> that receives the input signal from the fiber optic channel. Circuit <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> converts fiber-optic signal to packets of data and supplies it to a clock data recovery (CDR) circuit <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. CDR circuit <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> recovers the clock and data signals that may be in the frequency range of about 2.5 GHz, or higher. Established telecommunication standards require the transceiver to perform various functions, including data monitoring and error correction. These functions are performed at a lower frequency. Thus, the transceiver uses a demultiplexer <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> which deserializes the 2.5 GHz data stream into, for example, 16 parallel signals having a frequency of about 155 MHz. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> then performs the monitoring and error correction functions at the lower (155 MHz) frequency. A multiplexer and clock multiplication unit (CMU) <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> converts the parallel signals back into a single bit stream at 2.5 GHz. This signal is then retransmitted back onto the fiber optic channel by a laser drive <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>. The combined C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS/CMOS technique of the present invention allows fabrication of demultiplexer <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, ASIC <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> and multiplexer and CMU <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> on a single silicon die in a similar fashion as described in connection with the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. That is, demultiplexer <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> and multiplexer and CMU <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> are implemented in C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS with ASIC <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> implemented in conventional CMOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the present invention provides various circuit techniques for implementing ultra high speed circuits using current-controlled CMOS (C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS) logic fabricated in conventional CMOS process technology. An entire family of logic elements including inverter/buffers, level shifters, NAND, NOR, XOR gates, latches, flip-flops and the like have been developed using C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS according to the present invention. In one embodiment, the present invention advantageously combines high speed C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS logic with low power conventional CMOS logic. According to this embodiment circuits such as transceivers along fiber optic channels can be fabricated on a single chip where the ultra-high speed portions of the circuit utilize C<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>MOS and the relatively lower speed parts of the circuit use conventional CMOS logic. While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to use various alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Therefore, the scope of the present invention should be determined not with reference to the above description but should, instead, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with their full scope of equivalents. </paragraph>
