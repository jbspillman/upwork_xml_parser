<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The method of the present invention involves a numerical game of chance, which includes a parlay and a bonus playing option. A player selects a series of five (5) numbers from a set of eighty (80) numbers and makes a wager. The player then selects a second series of five numbers from a set of eighty numbers and makes another wager. The player then is given the option to make a combination wager whereby the first series of five numbers and second series of five numbers are combined. The gaming establishment then draws five winning numbers randomly from the set of eighty numbers. A player wins if his first series of five numbers matches the winning numbers, if his second series of five numbers matches the winning numbers or if any combination of the two series of numbers (i.e., ten numbers selected) matches the winning numbers. Additionally, another option allows the player to purchase between one (1) and five (5) bonus numbers, which are also used in combination with the players selected numbers to determine if the player has a winning match. Additionally, another option exists whereby the player is given an option to make a wager (parlay wager) on obtaining one or more winning numbers on each series of five number selected. The invention also includes a linked version of the numerical game of chance were individual gaming establishments are interconnected so that wagers can be pooled and larger jackpots are created for the game. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND-FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of playing games of chance such as Keno or Lottery, which allows a player to potentially win a large sum of money by pre-selecting a series of numbers that may match a series of numbers randomly drawn by the gaming establishment for that game. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One of the most popular and well-recognized numerical games of chance is Keno. Traditionally, these games have been played by having a players select a series of numbers (e.g., five (5)) from a pool of numbers (e.g., one (1) through sixty (60)) along with placing a wager (e.g., $1(one dollar)) on the outcome of the game. The player is betting that the series of numbers he selected matches the series of winning numbers drawn by the gaming establishment (e.g., casino or restaurant). The player wins if his series of numbers matches the series of winning numbers drawn by the gaming establishment. Typically, the player who has an exact match (e.g., five out of five) wins the entire jackpot while he would win a portion of the jackpot or pre-determined amount of money if he selected four out of five, three out of five, two out of five or one out of five. The amount of money won by the player is usually pre-determined by the gaming establishment and are based upon a number of different factors including the mathematical probability of selecting the correct numbers which vary depending upon the pool of numbers selected from (e.g., 1 through 80) and the amount of money wagered on the game and number of people having winning matches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although traditional numerical games of chance such as Keno have been fairly popular and somewhat successful in generating large jackpots, the prior art has failed to recognize that a more exciting method of playing Keno can be created that would increase the number of players who would participate in the game which would result in higher revenue for the gaming establishments and higher payouts to the players. Typically months will go by before anyone hits the jackpot in traditional Keno, while one of the novelties of this invention is that the chances of someone winning the jackpot will increases substantially since the player can purchase two separate tickets and make a third wager to combine the selected numbers on each ticket. Also, by interconnecting different Keno game sites, a larger number of people can play the same games and, therefore, larger jackpots can be created much faster than traditional Keno by taking a percentage of all wagers from each individual Keno gaming sites and pooling them together. By creating larger jackpots this will encourage more players to participate in Keno games. Additionally, a player can increase his chances of winning by purchasing bonus numbers, which can be used in combination to the numbers chosen or selected initially. Also, another added feature allows the player to make a parlay wager whereby the player can bet that he will select one or more winning numbers on each of the two previous purchased ticket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to link a number of individual Keno gaming establishment sites together so that a percentage of wagers from each site can be pooled together to create a separate jackpot associated with a linked game in order to create larger jackpots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to establish a combination wagering game wherein a player can place an additional wager that the combination of numbers contained on two tickets purchased separately will match the winning numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to establish bonus numbers, which can be purchased separately by the player and used in addition to and in substitution for any of the numbers chosen initially by the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to establish a parlay wagering option whereby the player is betting that he will have one or more winning numbers on each purchased ticket.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> represents a diagram of the eighty numbers which are displayed at the gaming site and which encompass the numbers that may be drawn from by the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represents an apparatus for playing the numerical game of chance according to an embodiment of the present invention (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;system&rdquo;). The system consists of numerous data entry points (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) (herein collectively referred to as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) that exist throughout a given gaming site location (e.g., casino). The data entry points consist of a computer monitor with a keyboard. Each data entry point is directly connected to a main computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so as to allow information to flow from <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The data entry point <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed so as to allow a player to select a series of game numbers from a set of acceptable game numbers which are then transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> were they can be received stored and accepted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. shows how the invention is played. The player selects a first series of five (5) numbers from the list of eighty (80) numbers similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The player enters these numbers into the data entry point <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When prompted by the system, the player verifies that his selections are correct <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If acceptable, the player must then place a wager (e.g., $1) on his selection. The player then selects a second series of five numbers from the list of eighty numbers. The player enters these numbers into the data entry point <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When prompted by the system, the player verifies that his selections are correct <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If acceptable, the player must then place a wager (e.g., $1) on his second selection. The player is then offered to wager on a combination game wherein the numbers of the first and second series of five numbers selected by the player will be combined to determine if they match with the five winning game numbers. All selections and bets are stored in the system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a print out <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is generated and provided to the player. The player is given an opportunity to play additional games by repeating steps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At a certain predetermined time, the system will randomly draw a series of five winning game numbers (hereinafter &ldquo;winning numbers&rdquo;) by selecting from the set of eighty numbers using a random number generator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The series of winning numbers will be transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and displayed by remote monitors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> located throughout the gaming establishment. The player can then compare his selections with the winning numbers. The player will be paid a predetermined percentage of money wagered on that game if the player&apos;s selections from the first series of five numbers exactly match the winning numbers or if the player&apos;s selections from the second series of five numbers exactly match the winning numbers. Additionally, if the player purchased a combination game ticket, the player will be considered a winner and be paid a predetermined percentage of money wagered on that game if any combination of the first series of five numbers and the second series of numbers match the series of five (5) winning numbers drawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the player may also, in the alternative to the selecting of the second series of five numbers or in addition to the selecting of the second series of five numbers, purchase one (1) to five (5) bonus numbers at the data entry point <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These bonus numbers which are selected from one of the eighty numbers previously identified will also be used in combination with the first and, if applicable the second series of five numbers, to determine if the player is a winner by obtaining a match of the winning numbers. Additionally, the player is given the option to make a parlay wager on whether he will obtain one or more winning numbers in each of the two series of five numbers selected. If the player makes a parlay wager, he will be determined a winner and be paid a pre-determined percentage of the jackpot if he has at least one winning number on the first series of five numbers and also at least one winning number on the second series of numbers that match the series of five (5) winning numbers drawn. The more winning numbers the player has on each of the two tickets purchased, the larger the payout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represents a method of playing a linked numerical game of chance. The object of this invention is to increase the jackpot by interconnecting several individual Keno games together. The system is configured so that each individual gaming site establishment (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, etc.) (hereinafter collectively referred to as <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) is connected to a linked computer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so as to allow information such as numbers selected and wagers to be transmitted from <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Each time a player makes a wager at one of the individual gaming sites <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a certain predetermined percentage (e.g., 10%) is transmitted to the linked computer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> where it is received, accepted and stored. As the wagers come into the computer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> they are pooled together to form a jackpot. All players at the individual gaming sites have an opportunity to play the linked game, which is played exactly the same way as the game identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
