<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hair conditioning composition comprising a particular fatty alcohol mixture, and to a cosmetic process for treating the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> After-shampoo conditioners are conditioning compositions that are well known in the art. They are generally fatty alcohol emulsions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The fatty alcohols thus used are well known to those skilled in the art as being, especially, conditioners and/or thickeners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Specifically, saturated long-chain primary alcohols containing on average from 25 to 45 carbon atoms are described in documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,213,716 and 5,348,736 from Colgate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Documents WO 99/62467 and WO 99/62492 from Procter &amp; Gamble also describe hair conditioning compositions comprising, inter alia, a mixture of cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and behenyl alcohol, the behenyl alcohol constituting up to 15% of the alcohol mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After applying the after-shampoo conditioners of the prior art, in particular on fine hair, the Applicant found that the hair was charged and lacked lightness, especially after repeated use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has thus sought to obtain a less substantial deposit of fatty alcohols and of conditioning agents on fine hair, while at the same time conserving good conditioning properties such as suppleness and a smooth nature for wet hair, and manageability for dry hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has discovered, surprisingly, that by limiting the length of the carbon chain of the fatty alcohols in the after-shampoo conditioners, to a number of carbon atoms of between 20 and 24, it is possible to reduce the fatty alcohol deposit on the hair and also the deposit of conditioning agents that co-precipitate with the fatty alcohol, such as, for example, silicones and cationic surfactants. These compositions thus make it possible to overcome the drawbacks described above and to obtain wet hair that is more supple and smoother, and also dried hair that is more manageable and more individualized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One subject of the present invention is thus a hair conditioning composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable aqueous medium, at least one cationic surfactant and a fatty alcohol mixture as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another subject of the invention consists of a cosmetic process for treating the hair using the abovementioned composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A subject of the invention is also the use of the said composition as an after-shampoo conditioner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Other subjects, characteristics, aspects and advantages of the invention will emerge even more clearly on reading the description and the various examples that follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the hair conditioning composition comprises, in a cosmetically acceptable aqueous medium, at least one cationic surfactant, a fatty alcohol mixture that essentially comprises C<highlight><subscript>20-24 </subscript></highlight>fatty alcohols, and optionally detergent surfactants in an amount of less than or equal to 4% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;essentially&rdquo; means a fatty alcohol mixture comprising at least 60% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight and more particularly at least 90% by weight, of C<highlight><subscript>20-24 </subscript></highlight>fatty alcohols relative to the total weight of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The C<highlight><subscript>20-24 </subscript></highlight>fatty alcohols that may be used in the alcohol mixture of the present invention comprise a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon-based chain. They are preferably primary fatty alcohols with a saturated linear chain. Examples that may be mentioned especially include behenyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol and lignoceryl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The composition according to the invention can also contain an amount of less than or equal to 40% by weight, preferably less than or equal to 20% by weight and more particularly less than or equal to 10% by weight, relative to the total weight of the mixture, of at least one C<highlight><subscript>14-19 </subscript></highlight>alcohol such as, for example, cetyl alcohol or stearyl alcohol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, the composition according to the invention can contain an amount of less than or equal to 40% by weight, preferably less than or equal to 20% by weight and more particularly less than or equal to 10% by weight, relative to the total weight of the mixture, of at least one C<highlight><subscript>25-40 </subscript></highlight>alcohol such as, for example, ceryl alcohol or montanyl alcohol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As a fatty alcohol mixture that is particularly preferred in the composition according to the invention, it is possible to use, for example, the fatty alcohol mixture consisting of 76% by weight behenyl alcohol, 17% by weight arachidyl alcohol, 1.5% by weight lignoceryl alcohol, 5% by weight stearyl alcohol and 0.5% by weight cetyl alcohol. This mixture is sold under the name Nafol&reg; 1822 C by the company Condea. Other examples that may also be mentioned include the mixture sold under the name Nafol&reg; 2298 by the company Condea, which comprises 98% by weight behenyl alcohol; the mixture sold under the name Nafol&reg; 20-22 by the company Condea, which comprises 30% by weight behenyl alcohol, 58% by weight arachidyl alcohol and 6% by weight lignoceryl alcohol; or the mixture sold under the name Nafol&reg; 20&plus; by the company Condea, which comprises 50% by weight arachidyl alcohol, 29% by weight behenyl alcohol, 14% by weight lignoceryl alcohol and 6% by weight stearyl alcohol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The amount of the fatty alcohol mixture in the composition according to the invention is especially between 0.1% and 20% by weight and preferably between 0.5% and 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The composition according to the invention comprises one or more cationic surfactants that are well known per se, such as salts of optionally polyoxyalkylenated primary, secondary or tertiary fatty amines and quaternary ammonium salts, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Examples of quaternary ammonium salts that may especially be mentioned include: </paragraph>
