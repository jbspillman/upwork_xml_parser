<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to accessories for firearms, more particularly to devices, apparatuses and methods for efficiently mounting accessories to firearms and more specifically to devices, apparatuses and methods for efficiently mounting accessories as well as providing a mechanism for generating a scent. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The general concept of attaching accessories to firearms is known in the art. Early concepts for attaching accessories involved the use of the bayonet mount that is usually on and at the end of the barrel of the firearm alone or in combination with additional structure. Federal laws have been enacted, however, that effectively restricts bayonet mounts to only weapons that are employed by the military or law enforcement authorities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other concepts involved the use of a plurality of bands or ring clamps or other structures that may block or otherwise interfere with the firearm&apos;s aiming sights, thereby preventing the aiming sights from been properly used for aiming the firearm during the daytime. Such bands, clamps or other structures tend to make the firearm unnecessarily heavier and more awkward to use. Consequently, these bands, clamps, devices or other structures are removed from the weapon at times other than when the accessory is to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one particular hunting application, the hunter is located in a tree stand or hunting blind. In order to get into the tree stand, the hunter has to climb the tree using tree branches or a temporary or permanent ladder type arrangement. In some cases, the hunter hands the weapon or firearm up to another person already in the tree stand. There have been cases where the firearm was accidentally discharged as the weapon was being handed to the other person causing injury or death to the person the weapon was being handed to. In other cases, the firearm has slipped out of the hunter&apos;s hand while climbing and fallen to the ground, whereby the firearm is damaged and/or accidentally discharged again creating the risk of grievous injury. In addition, the hunter may place the firearm in their lap while the hunter is in the tree stand for any of a number of reasons including the cold temperature of the air. There have been occasions where the firearm has slipped out of the hunter&apos;s lap and fallen to the ground, resulting in damage or accidentally discharging of the weapon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because the locations where such accidents can occur are typically remote from areas serviced by conventional normal emergency medical personnel, there can be delays in obtaining medical assistance and consequently increasing the severity and consequences of the injury. Thus, there continues to be a need to develop hunting techniques and devices to minimize the risk of injury to hunters and bystanders resulting from the accidental discharging of a falling weapon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It also has become desirous to make recordings or movies of one&apos;s hunting experience. As a practical matter it is extremely difficult for a hunter to target the quarry, be it deer, turkey, flying ducks, flying geese, pheasant, etc. as well as focusing the camera using the camera&apos;s rearview finder so the camera is viewing the target/area including the target (e.g., switching back and forth between the aiming sights and the view finder). Consequently, another person typically operates the camera or recording device to make the recording without, in some cases, the knowledge of what quarry the hunter is actually targeting. It thus would be desirous to improve upon existing techniques so the hunter can target and record at the same time without involving another hunter or bystander. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While hunting, it is a common practice to hide or mask the smell or odor of the hunter with an animal scent or musk such as, for example, deer urine. The conventional technique is to apply the animal scent on the hunter&apos;s boots or hat, wearing a scent button or pad on one&apos;s clothing or hanging the button or pad off of one&apos;s self. Consequently, the hunter&apos;s clothing or shoes retains the odor of the scent, which is not desirable when the hunter returns home. Alternatively, a scent generating device or other mechanism is hung off or tied to the tree proximal the hunter or the tree-stand (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 4,523,177). Such a technique is limited essentially to those cases where the hunter intends to remain at a specific location and not move around as well as requiring the hunter to carry such a device/mechanism to the tree stand, hunting blind, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It thus would be desirable to provide a new device(s) that can be attached to a firearm and that can be used to at least one of generate a masking scent, hang a firearm and/or to record or make movies of the hunting experience as well as methods related thereto. It would be particularly desirable to provide such a device and method that would not interfere with the firearm&apos;s aiming sights when the device is attached to the firearm so the device need not be detached and re-attached from the firearm/weapon particularly when in the field. It also would be desirable to provide such a device that would make the firearm less awkward when it is attached thereto use as compared to prior art devices. Such devices preferably would be simple in construction and less costly than prior art devices and such methods would not require highly skilled users to utilize the device. </paragraph>

The middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is sized and configured to receive therein the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> upon which is mounted in the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Although the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being circular, this shall not be construed as a limitation as the through aperture can have other geometric shape that is otherwise appropriate for the intended use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As provided hereinafter, the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> also can be utilized for receiving therein a portion of the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In addition, the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be dispensed with for those applications in which an accessory is secured to the lower portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The lower portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes an aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that extends from the lower surface to the surface of the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A mechanism is disposed in the low portion aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that extends into the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> so as to provide a mechanism for generally securing the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, the lower portion aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is threaded and a threaded member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (e.g. a hex screw, a set screw) is threadably received therein, where the threaded member is used for generally securing the tubular member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is configured and arranged so that it can be adapted to perform any of the applications or functions described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Although such features are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, they are described hereinafter in connection with one of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It should be recognized, however, that a base member according to the present invention is configurable so as to as exclude such other features so as to yield a base member particularly configured for a specific application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which in the illustrated embodiment is a U-shaped member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> whose terminal ends are threaded ends <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is made up of any of a number of materials known to those skilled in the art, more particularly materials, such as aluminum, titanium or composite materials, that exhibit good structural characteristics while being of light weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a horseshoe shaped member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as this shape generally complements the cylindrical shape of the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as forming a shape whereby the inner surface or diameter of the horseshoe shaped member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> mechanically engages the top surface of the barrel. The particular configuration and arrangement of the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is generally established so as to form a three-dimensional shape that complements the particular portion of the weapon to which the clamp member will come into contact with as well as being removably secured to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, for example, the clamp member can be U-shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Also, while the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a tubular member, the member can be configured and arranged so that all or portions of the clamp member provide a flat surface opposing the weapon and/or are in the shape of flat stock. For example, the arcuate portion <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the horseshoe shaped member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be shaped, formed or arranged so the surface that opposes the surface of the weapon is generally flat thereby increasing the contact area. Alternatively, the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be formed so that the portion in contact with the weapon is a generally flat member and the portions passing through upper portion through apertures <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are generally cylindrically shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in the illustrated embodiment the ends <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are threaded so that the clamp member is removably secured to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> using any of a number of threaded devices such as nuts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, wing nuts, stop nuts or nuts with stop washers as are known to those skilled in the art. This shall not constitute a limitation, however, as the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be secured to the base member using any of a number of techniques known to those skilled in the art so the clamp member and base member mechanically engage the outer surface of the weapon, such as the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a gun. Further, and although in the illustrated embodiment the mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is removably secured to the weapon, it is within the scope of the present invention for techniques to be used whereby the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is more permanently secured to the base member such as by adhesives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, a scent generating mechanism such as the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured and arranged so as to be removable secured to the tubular element <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also is configured and arranged so that it can hold scent material of an animal, which scent material is preferably automatically dispensed or given up to the surrounding environment so as to mask the odor or smell of the human hunter and/or bystander. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> More particularly, by mounting the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the weapon, the hunter can dispense or distribute the animal scent to the environment (e.g., air) by moving the gun back and forth or side to side as well as when the hunter is walking forward and/or backwards. Essentially, the movement of the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> due to the motion of the weapon and/or the hunter assists in making the scent become airborne. Also, because the weapon is generally disposed in a direction that should be between the quarry and the hunter, the scent is dispensed in way that should mask the smell or odor of the hunter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment, the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes an outer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is generally configured and arranged to releasably retain the scent material therein and so the scent generated by the scent material can be released therefrom into the atmosphere. Such an outer member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes any of a number of materials known to those skilled in the art that can take up and/or absorb the scent material and allow the scent to become airborne or released to the environment. Such materials include but are not limited to foam materials or other absorbent materials including but not limited to an oleophillic absorbent fabric. Oleophillic fabrics are particularly suited because the material rapidly and efficiently can picks up or absorbs the scent material that is typically in liquid form and typically absorbs many times its own weight. Such oleophillic material also typically takes on the characteristics of the material being absorbed and exhibits good resistance to tearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The scent material comprises any of a number of materials known to those skilled in the hunting arts for generating scents of animals. In an exemplary embodiment, the scent material comprises animal urine such as deer urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, the scent pad also is configured to include an inner member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, where the outer and inner members <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are formed so they are mechanically engaged with each other so as to form an unified structure. The inner member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes an aperture <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> therein which extends along the length of the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and in which aperture is received the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The inner member aperture <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is sized and configured so the scent pad is removably secured to the exposed end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when the tubular member is secured to the mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. More specifically, the inner member aperture <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is sized and configured so that it should not fall off as the weapon is moved about or be easily removed while hunting, however, the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> should be capable of being removed by the hunter without the need for special tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> There is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A,B</cross-reference> two exemplary illustrative embodiments of a tubular element <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a,b </italic></highlight>to which is secured the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and which tubular element also is secured to the mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In one embodiment, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the tubular element <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is substantially straight or extends along a long axis for its entire length. There is provided a notch <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in at least one side of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the notch may be configured so to extend about a substantial portion or the entire circumference of the tubular member. As described herein, the notch <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is used for securing the tubular element within the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The end of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opposite the notch <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the exposed end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, to which is secured the scent pad is preferably configured with any of a number of mechanisms or surface artifacts known to those skilled in the art, such as knurling, for purposes of increasing mechanical engagement between the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the surface of the inner member aperture <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes an offset <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> so that the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is displaced a distance from the notched end of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this way, for example, the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be positioned further away from or closer to the weapon than would be possible with the essentially straight tubular member of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. Although the illustrated offset <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is generally orthogonal in arrangement this is not a limitation as the offset can be formed so as to form other angles (e.g., 45 degrees) between the long axes of the notched and exposed ends of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It also should be recognized that the member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to which the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is removably secured to need not be cylindrical in form as other geometric shapes are contemplated for use with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The use of this mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be best understood from the following discussion along with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As indicated above, the user takes the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and position them such that the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is located below the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The user would then tighten the nuts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereby clamping the barrel between the clamping member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. When so secured to the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> do not interfere with the aiming sights of the weapon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The user either before or after securing the clamping member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> slides the portion of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including the notch <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> until the notch is positioned opposite the lower portion aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The threaded member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then screwed into the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> thereby securing the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with respect to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at least so that the tubular member is restrained from moving or has limited motion along the long axis of the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In more specific embodiments, the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is secured within the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so as to resist or limit rotational motion of the tubular member as well as resisting or limiting linear motion along the long axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The user also secures the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the exposed end <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Such securing of the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be accomplished either before or after the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is secured to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as described hereinabove. Further, and at an appropriate time, the user imbues the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with scent material, using any of a number of techniques either before or after the scent pad is secured to the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, the user applies deer urine to the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or places the scent pad in a container of deer urine until the scent pad is unable to absorb additional deer urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the scent is dispensed or dispersed to the air by normal movement of the weapon (e.g. gun) and/or the hunter or by deliberate waving or moving of the weapon by the hunter, thereby masking the scent, smell or odor of the hunter as well as those who maybe with him/her. Following or after concluding the hunting activities for the day or some other time period, the hunter removes the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The removed scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is stored for future use or is disposed of in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process or securing a scent pad to the tubular member is repeated as and when needed. Because the mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the present invention yields a structure that is light weight and not bulky, a hunter can leave the mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>attached to the weapon without making the weapon unduly heavy or awkward to use during hunting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Now referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> there is shown a mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is configured so as to be removable attached or secured to a portion of the weapon as well as being configured so that a weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is movable attached thereto. In more particular embodiments, the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also is configured and arranged so that a scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also is removably attached thereto. Reference shall be made to the foregoing discussion regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as well as the figures themselves for common features and functionalities not otherwise discussed or described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in the illustrated embodiment the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is configured so as to generally form a J-hook type of hanger generally having first, second and third segments <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thereof. It should be recognized, however, that the weapon hanger can be arranged so as to have any of a number of shapes and configurations known to those skilled in the art. The weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is made up of any of a number of materials known to those skilled in the art, more particularly materials, such as aluminum, titanium or composite materials, that exhibit good structural characteristics while being of light weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a notched region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that extends about the circumference thereof. As with the notch <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, this notched region <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is positioned within the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so as to oppose the lower portion aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The notch <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is sized and arranged so as to restrain lateral motion along the long axis of the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> as well as to mechanically engage the threaded member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> so as to be capable of handling the loads imposed by the weight of a hanging gun/weapon. It also is within the scope of the present invention for such mechanical engagement to withstand other loads that may be imposed during hunting. In a particular embodiment, the notch <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is sized so that the threaded member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> mechanically engages the circumferential surfaces on the notch so the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> does not rotate loosely within the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> but can be moved by a user from a stored to the hanging position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In a more particular embodiment, the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is configured so a long axis <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the third segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>ultimately intersects a long axis <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>of the first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>where the point of intersection occurs outside the physical boundaries of the weapon hanger. More specifically, the intersection of the third segment long axis and the first segment long axis forms an angle in the range of from about 10 degrees to about 20 degrees, more particularly an angle of about 15 degrees. Such an arrangement yields a weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that can be easily secured about and removed from a tree limb or branch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In addition, and as illustrated, a scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is securable to an exposed end of the first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As with the tubular member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, this exposed end can be configured and arranged with any of a number of surface artifacts or surface treatments known to those skilled in the art (e.g., knurling) that can be used to increase the mechanical engagement between the inner surface of the scent pad inner member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the exposed and of the first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The use of this mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in combination with a weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be best understood from the following discussion along with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As indicated above, the user takes the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and positions them such that the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is located below the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The user then tightens the nuts <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereby clamping the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the clamping member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. When so secured to the barrel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the clamp member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> do not interfere with the aiming sights of the weapon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The user either before or after securing the clamping member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the barrel slides the weapon hanger first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> until the notch <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is positioned opposite the lower portion aperture <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The threaded member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then screwed into the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> thereby securing the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with respect to the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at least so that the weapon hanger is restrained from moving or has limited motion along the long axis of the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In more specific embodiments, the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is secured within the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so as to resist or limit rotational motion of the weapon hanger first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> does not loosely rotate within the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The user also secures a scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the exposed end of the weapon hanger first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Such securing of the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be accomplished either before or after the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is secured within the base member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as described hereinabove. Further, and at an appropriate time, the user imbues the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with scent material (e.g., deer urine), using any of a number of techniques either before or after the scent pad is secured to the weapon hanger first segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. For example, the user applies deer urine to the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or places the scent pad in a container of deer urine until it is unable to absorb additional deer urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the scent is dispensed or dispersed to the air by normal movement of the weapon (e.g., gun) and/or the hunter or by deliberate waving or moving of the weapon by the hunter, thereby masking the scent, smell or odor of the hunter as well as those who maybe with him/her. Following or after concluding the hunting activities for the day or some other time period, the hunter removes the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The removed scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is stored for future use or is disposed of in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> If a hunter wishes to temporarily hang a weapon such as a gun <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the branch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a tree <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or a man-made fixture (e.g., pole or structural member of a hunting blind), the hunter positions the open end of the hook end of the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> about the branch or man-made fixture so that the arcuate or a second segment <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the weapon hanger contacts the branch or man-made fixture (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). In a more particular embodiment, the hunter also rotates the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> within the middle portion through aperture <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> from a stored to an operational or hanging position prior to hanging of the weapon and performing the reverse steps after taking the weapon down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process or securing a scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or hanging the weapon is repeated as and when needed. Because the mounting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and the scent pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the present invention yields a structure that is light weight and not bulky, a hunter can decide to leave the mounting member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and weapon hanger <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> attached to the weapon without making the weapon unduly heavy or awkward to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, there is shown a mounting device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that is configured so as to be removable attached or secured to a portion of a weapon as well as being configured so that a recording device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> also is removably attached thereto.
