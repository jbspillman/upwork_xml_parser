<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for the recovery of perfluorinated sulphonic acid from a hydrocarbon residue. In particular, the invention provides recovery of those acids from spent acid residue by extraction including steps of diluting the spent acid residue with the acid or a mixture of an alkyl ammonium salt of the acid and the acid to obtain a liquid from which the extraction of acid with water is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> EP Patent No. 1,044,963 A describes a process in which spent acid from an alkylation process is processed in a stripping column with the result that fresh, regenerated acid is obtained as a top product along with a hydrocarbon product originating from cracking of the organic part of spent acid. Spent acid residue resulting from the stripping process described in this patent publication is typically a highly viscous liquid containing mainly higher aromatic hydrocarbons and acid. Depending on the severity of the spent acid stripping operation, the spent acid residue can be solid at room temperature and as such, the residual acid is difficult to extract from the residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is known that residue can be dissolved in solvents such as anisol and residual acid can be extracted with water from such a mixture. However, due to density of anisol being close to that of water, phase separation is a troublesome operation. Depending on the acid concentration in the aqueous phase, this phase can be more or less dense than the organic phase thereby causing problems with phase inversion in automated continuous phase separation processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It was previously observed that addition of certain co-solvents to hydrocarbon residue decreases the organic phase density and leaves this phase less dense than the aqueous phase. Solvents such as THF have been found to be efficient co-solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Uses of solvents, which are not directly needed in the acid regeneration process, are undesirable due to the added complexity of the overall process when solvent regeneration is included. From a process standpoint it is desirable to recover residual amounts of acid from spent acid residue without addition of further solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> EP Patent No. 1,065,199 A describes a process by which acid is stripped from a mixture of acid and an alkyl ammonium salt of the acid in a stripping column with the result that fresh, regenerated acid is obtained as a top product. It has now been found that spent acid residue from the stripping column is mixable with alkyl ammonium salts of the acid and that the resulting mixture is liquid at room temperature, which reduces the complexity of handling, storing and further processing of the residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it was observed that sufficient amounts of alkyl ammonium salt added to the residue result in precipitation of a fine powder of hydrocarbon residue when contacting the mixture with water to extract residual amounts of acid. Alkyl ammonium salt of the acid can be mixed with the spent acid prior to introduction into a stripping column, thus reducing plugging of the bottom exit system of the stripping column especially in up-set situations. Thereby, it is possible to combine the stripping process described in EP Patent No. 1,044,963 A with the process described in EP Patent No. 1,065,199 A and performing the two processes in a single stripping column. Spent acid regeneration is in a further embodiment of the invention obtained by mixing spent acid from an alkylation process with a mixture of a corresponding acid and an alkyl ammonium salt of the acid as further explained in more detail in the following description with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the attached drawing.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Spent acid from alkylation reactor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is passed to spent acid stripping column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Prior to introduction into stripping column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the spent acid is admixed with a mixture of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and triethyl ammonium triflate from a down stream acid/salt stripping column <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as further described below. In stripping column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> trifluo&mdash;romethanesulphonic acid contained in the spent acid is stripped off by means of n-pentane and recycled to alkylation reactor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Stripping residue formed in column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a highly viscous hydrocarbon mixture, which by addition of the acid/salt mixture to the spent acid is liquefied as described herein previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The residue contains valuable amounts of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and ammonium trifalte, which are recovered by extraction with water in extraction unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Water is separated for the acid/triflate mixture in stripping column <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by stripping the aqueous mixture with n-pentane. Recovered acid/triflate mixture is then recycled to inlet of stripping column <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A mixture of spent trifluoromethanesulphonic acid from an isobutane alkylation pilot plant containing 67.4 wt % trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, 30.6 wt % higher hydrocarbon by-products and 2.0 wt % water was mixed with 10 wt % trifluoromethanesulphonic acid in triethyl ammonium triflate. The resulting mixture contained 56.0 wt % trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, 24.5 wt % higher hydrocarbon by-products, 18.0 wt % triethyl ammonium triflate and 1.6 wt % water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The mixture was charged at a feed rate of 575 g/h to top of a stripping column at a temperature of 50&deg; C. The stripping column was a 0.6 m of a ID&equals;32.5 mm tube filled with 150 ml 3*3 mm SS rings on top of 230 ml 6*6 mm glass rings and operated at atmospheric pressure. Stripping agent (n-pentane) was added at a feed rate of 855 g/h near bottom of the column at a temperature of 255&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Recovered trifluoromethanesulphonic acid was condensed overhead along with stripping agent and a hydrocarbon fraction substantially boiling in the gasoline range formed by cracking of higher hydrocarbon by-products from the spent acid. Spent acid residue containing triethyl ammonium triflate was removed from the bottom of the column.
