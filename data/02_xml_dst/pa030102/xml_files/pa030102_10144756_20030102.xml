<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a protective, diffusive film and more particularly to a high-quality protective, diffusive film which can suppress curling and deflection, a process for producing the same, and a surface light source device and a liquid crystal display device using said protective, diffusive film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A large number of surface light source devices provided with a protective, diffusive film have hitherto been proposed. An example of a surface light source device using a protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> provided with a surface light source device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is an edge-type flat light source. The surface light source device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises, for example, a light source <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a light guide plate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a reflection film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a light diffusive film <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, a lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and a protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The light guide plate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is surface light projection means, and has a light source <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> on its side end and, on its non-light-outgoing surface remote from a light outgoing surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a dot pattern <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for diffusing light from the light source <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and directing the light to a light outgoing direction. The reflection film <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is provided on the non-light-outgoing surface side of the light guide plate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and functions to block off unnecessary light beams and, at the same time, to reflect and return light beams to a predetermined direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is disposed on the light outgoing surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side of the light guide plate <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> through a light diffusive film (a diffusive plate) <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for diffusing light to conceal the dot pattern <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> on its prism surface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>faces the light outgoing surface side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to impart the function of diffusing light to the light diffusive film (diffusive plate) <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, the light diffusive film (diffusive plate) <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> has hitherto been formed by incorporating, in a dispersed state, organic or inorganic beads as a light diffusing agent into a transparent resin substrate, or by coating an ink containing organic or inorganic beads as a diffusing agent onto a transparent resin substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided on the light outgoing surface side of the lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, for preventing the prism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> from coming into direct contact and being damaged by each other, for example, due to vibration in transit. The protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also has the function of slightly diffusing light for concealing stripes of the prism <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the lens film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a spacer (not shown), and the like. To this end, the protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has hitherto been formed by incorporating, in a dispersed state, organic or inorganic beads as a light diffusing agent into a transparent resin substrate, or by coating an ink containing organic or inorganic beads as a diffusing agent onto a transparent resin substrate. A transmission liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> comprising a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sandwiched between a lower substrate <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and an upper substrate <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is provided on the light outgoing side of the surface light source device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is illuminated from backside by the surface light source device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The conventional protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is generally formed by coating an diffusing ink (an ink prepared by adding a diffusing agent in a resin) on both sides of a transparent substrate. As shown in Table 1, there is a difference in coverage between the coating on the top surface of the transparent substrate and the coating on the under surface of the transparent substrate.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the conventional protective, diffusive film, when the difference in coverage between the coating on the top surface of the transparent resin substrate and the coating on the under surface of the transparent resin substrate is large, curling and/or deflection are likely to occur through the action of heat and/or humidity. This is considered attributable to the difference in stretching, derived from the difference in coverage, between the diffusing ink coating on the top surface of the transparent resin substrate and the diffusing ink coating on the under surface of the transparent resin substrate. In particular, under conditions within backlight for a liquid crystal display device which is brought to a closed space in which the temperature is raised to a high temperature, i.e., up to about 90&deg; C., &ldquo;deflection&rdquo; of the film sometimes occurred. When the coverage of the coating on the light source side (under surface) was made substantially equal to the coverage of the coating on the viewer side (top surface), the following phenomena often occurred. (i) The concaves and convexes on the surface were reduced, and interference fringe appearance defects between the protective, diffusive film and the underlying light guide plate or lens film sometimes occurred. (ii) Increasing the amount of the diffusing agent (fine particles) enhanced diffusive properties (i.e., enhanced the haze value) and consequently lowered the utilization of light and sometimes deteriorated luminance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the conventional protective, diffusive film, the diffusive properties was imparted by adding a diffusing agent to the resin. Therefore, a variation in coverage caused a change in diffusive properties or a change in the shape of surface concaves and convexes. This sometimes affected the optical characteristics and the sticking preventive properties. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present inventor has now found that, when resin layers are provided respectively on the top surface and the under surface of the substrate layer by not using any diffusing agent (for example, finely particulate material) and bringing the difference in coverage between the resin layer provided on the top surface of the substrate layer and the resin layer provided on the under surface of the substrate layer to a value falling within a specific range, curling and deflection can be effectively prevented and, consequently, a high-quality protective, diffusive film can be provided. The present invention has been made based on such finding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the protective, diffusive film according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The protective, diffusive film in this embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) provided respectively on both sides of the substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, any diffusing agent (for example, finely particulate material) is not used in the resin layers constituting the protective, diffusive film. Further, the difference in coverage between the resin layer (protective, diffusive layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A) provided on the top surface of the transparent substrate film and the resin layer (protective, diffusive layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) provided on the under surface of the transparent substrate film is in the range of &minus;20% to &plus;20% in terms of the percentage of the coverage of one of the resin layers to the coverage of the other resin layer. By virtue of the adoption of the above construction, the protective, diffusive film according to the present invention has good concealment properties and optical characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> a) Transparent Substrate Layer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The transparent substrate layer (substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is specifically formed of a stretched or unstretched film of a thermoplastic resin, such as cellulosetriacetate, polyester, polyamide, polyimide, polypropylene, polymethyl pentene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetal, polymethyl methacrylate, polycarbonate, or polyurethane. The thickness of the transparent substrate layer is preferably 50 to 200 &mgr;m from the viewpoint of handleability, such as processability, although the thickness also varies depending upon the rigidity of the film. The transparent substrate layer on its top surface and under surface, where the resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) are provided, is preferably subjected to easy-adhesion treatment, such as corona discharge treatment, from the viewpoint of highly stabilizing the adhesion to the resin layers to be stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> b) Resin Layer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) have, on the surface thereof, fine concaves and convexes and protect members which come into contact with the protective, diffusive film, and have concealment effect by virtue of a suitable level of light diffusion properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) are identical to each other in components constituting the layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) each preferably have a surface roughness index Rz (ten-point mean roughness) in the range of 1 to 6 &mgr;m. When the surface roughness index Rz is in this range, the concealment properties and the optical characteristics are good. For example, the Rz value of the protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B (embodiment of the present invention) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is 1.6 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A haze defined as the ratio of the luminance of an object to the luminance of the object as viewed through a scattering medium is used as a measure of the level of light diffusion. The haze of the protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably in the range of 15 to 50, more preferably in the range of 20 to 40. When the haze is in this range, the concealment properties of the protective, diffusive film and the luminance are good. For example, the haze of the protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (embodiment of the present invention) is 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The count of Pc (profile peaks) in the resin layers (protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) is preferably in the range of 2 to 15. When the count of Pc is in this range, the concealment properties and the optical characteristics are good. The count of Pc (profile peaks) may be measured by a Pc1 method. The Pc1 method will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the Pc1 method, a count level CL is set, and two lines parallel to a center line C of a roughness curve F, an upper peak count level U and a lower peak count level D, are provided. In a portion between two points where the lower peak count level D crosses the roughness curve F, when one or more points, where the upper peak count level U crosses the roughness curve F, exist, this is counted as one profile peak. This count is carried out for a reference length L, and the surface roughness is expressed in terms of the count of the profile peaks. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, since there are four profile peaks, the count of Pc (profile peaks) as measured by the Pc1 method is 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the case of the protective, diffusive layers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B (embodiment of the present invention) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the count of Pc (profile peaks) as measured under conditions specified in Table 2 below is 8.

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A process for producing a protective, diffusive film will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fed through an inlet nip <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to a cylinder plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> having an inverted shape of concaves and convexes provided on the surface of the resin layer to be formed. An ionizing radiation-curable resin <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is fed through a pump <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to a die head <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and is evenly introduced into the cylinder plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. After the substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is brought into intimate contact with the cylinder plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by means of an inlet nip <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> (step of shaping), an ionizing radiation is applied to the assembly by an ionizing radiation exposure system <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> (a D-bulb ultraviolet lamp, manufactured by Fusion) to form an ionizing radiation-cured resin <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> which is adhered to the substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (step of curing). Thereafter, at an outlet nip <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the protective, diffusive layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A formed on the substrate film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is separated from the cylinder plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to form a film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is a form in the course of the formation of a protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A protective, diffusive layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B is further formed by the same step as described above on the film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to produce the protective, diffusive film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
