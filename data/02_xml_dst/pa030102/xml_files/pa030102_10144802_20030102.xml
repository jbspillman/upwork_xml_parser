<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">This invention provides a method for efficiently purifying 5&prime;-protected thymidines which cannot be efficiently purified by the prior art. Impurities can be separated by obtaining crystals including a carbonyl-containing solvent to provide a highly pure 5&prime;-protected thymidine. Thus, this invention allows 5&prime;-protected thymidines, which cannot be purified in an industrial scale by the prior art, to be easily provided with a high purity in a large scale. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for purifying a 5&prime;-protected thymidine and a derivative thereof. This invention also relates to a solvent inclusion compound of a 5&prime;-protected thymidine compound obtained as crystals from the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 5&prime;-protected thymidines are compounds useful as a raw material for an antisense DNA or the like, which has recently been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In recent years, with developments in manufacturing genomic drugs, antisense DNA drugs or the like have rapidly been developed. Therewith, a DNA oligomer used as a raw material, and further, protected deoxynucleosides used as raw materials for the oligomer are increasingly demanded. Regarding the pharmaceutical uses, it is necessary to use an extremely highly purified intermediate product to reduce generation of by-products formed based on impurities to a minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A 5&prime;-protected thymidine has been conventionally isolated and purified by column chromatography, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 6-507883 and 2000-264897, and Methods of Enzymol., 65 (1980). By this method, separation of impurities greatly different in their polarities or structures may be carried out relatively easily, but elimination of impurities having a similar structure is difficult. In particular, there are many cases where it is difficult to eliminate a 3&prime;-substituted isomer that is an especially problematic impurity. In addition, since this method needs a large-scale purification device, in view of mass production and mass supply in the future, it cannot help saying that this method has a large problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts to eliminate impurities without using column chromatography have been made. As an example of a method using a single solvent, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 58-180500 has disclosed a purification method using benzene, but in a practical use, the method gives a gel incorporating impurities rather than crystals and is, therefore, impractical. Furthermore, the method has a disadvantage that benzene, which is toxic, is used as a solvent. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-511480 and PCT Publication No. WO 200075154 have disclosed purification by reprecipitation. Reprecipitation is a method in which, after a crude compound is dissolved in a soluble solvent, the compound is compulsively reprecipitated by addition of an insoluble solvent or dropping into an insoluble solvent. Consequently, its purification ability is basically low. Moreover, it is industrially difficult to appropriately control the amount ratio between the soluble solvent and the insoluble solvent. In addition, where the amount ratio of these solvents is set inappropriately, it easily results in oilification or generates a viscous precipitate so that purification is apt to end in failure. Actually, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 60-152495, in some cases, the purified product is obtained as a viscous syrup, and, from an industrial viewpoint, this is a problem. Although some methods of forming amorphous by reprecipitation has been disclosed till now, no methods for obtaining a crystal by crystallization or recrystallization are known. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been completed in view of the conventional problems. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide an efficient process for producing an extremely pure 5&prime;-protected thymidine compound with no special facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a result of intensive studies by the present inventors directed toward the above object, it has been found that, using a carbonyl compound such as butyl acetate and 4-methyl-2-pentanone, a 5&prime;-protected thymidine compound can be obtained as a solvated complex including the solvent and be purified by a purification method such as crystallization or recrystallization, thereby completing the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An inclusion solvent used in this invention for preparation of the inclusion crystals is preferably a carbonyl compound having carbonyl represented by formula &lsqb;2&rsqb;. Examples of such a solvent include acetone, 2-butanone, 3-pentanone, 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 3-methyl-2-butanone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, t-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, amyl acetate, n-pentyl acetate, n-hexyl acetate, cyclohexyl acetate, n-propyl propionate and isopropyl propionate. These carbonyl compounds are usually used alone in a solvent, but two or more carbonyl compounds may be combined at a mixable ratio. Alternatively, a plurality of carbonyl compounds may be blended in advance to prepare a mixed solvent to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A liquid medium for forming inclusion crystals may be an inclusion solvent alone or a mixture of an inclusion solvent and a solvent not involved in forming inclusion crystals at a mixable ratio. For example, a single carbonyl-compound solvent or a solvent mixture of two or more carbonyl compounds may be combined with another solvent at a mixable ratio. The additional solvent used may be any mixable solvent, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methylethylketone and methylisobutylketone; nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran (THF); aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, cumene, xylenes, mesitylene, diisopropylbenzene and triisopropylbenzene; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ethers; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane and chlorobutane; pyridines such as pyridine, lutidine and quinoline; tertiary amines such as triethylamine and tributylamine; and polar solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl imidazolidinone (DMI) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A proportion of the additional solvent in the mixture is preferably up to 100 wt %, preferably up to 20 wt %, more preferably up to 10 wt % to the total amount of the carbonyl compound(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;inclusion crystal including a solvent&rdquo; means that a solvent plays an auxiliary role to form a crystal structure, such that a crystal is formed in a form wherein a solvent is taken up into a crystal lattice thereof, or a complex is formed by a weak interaction between a crystal and a solvent. The inclusion form and the crystal structure are not particularly limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The amount of a carbonyl-compound solvent in crystallization or recrystallization is not particularly limited, as far as the amount of the compound of formula &lsqb;1&rsqb; in the solvent is below its saturation solubility, but desirably the amount of the solvent is 5 to 150 folds both inclusive by weight, more desirably 8 to 50 folds both inclusive by weight of the amount of the compound of the formula &lsqb;1&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A temperature for crystallization and recrystallization are not particularly limited, but a temperature within a range from &minus;10&deg; C. to the boiling point of a solvent or a liquid medium is desired. Generally, purification can be performed more sufficiently by a single time of recrystallization, but purification at higher purity can also be realized by performing recrystallization repeatedly. A preferable liquid medium for recrystallization is that consisting of a inclusion solvent alone and it is more preferable to used the same single inclusion solvent in both of crystallization and recrystallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A preferable aspect of an inclusion compound obtained by the purification method according to this invention may be the above compound represented by formula &lsqb;6&rsqb;, where n and m represent an arbitrary integer, preferably an integer selected from the range of 1 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the present invention allows 5&prime;-protected thymidines to be effectively purified.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Preparation of a Complex of 5&prime;-O-(4,4&prime;-dimethoxytrityl)thymidine-(4-methyl-2-pentanone)(2:1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To a stirred solution of 40.0 g of thymidine (0.165 mol) in 500 mL of pyridine was added 56.0 g of dimethoxytrityl chloride (0.165 mol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. To the mixture, 16.7 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and evaporated under a reduced pressure. To the residue was added 500 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). To the stirred mixture was added 500 mL of water and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Then, the organic layer was separated and washed with 500 mL of water. The organic layer was evaporated under a reduced pressure. The residue was recrystallized from 900 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone to give a crystalline product, which was then collected by filtration. The crystalline product was dried in vacuo at 50&deg; C. to a constant weight to give 67.3 g of the product. NMR spectroscopy indicated that the crystalline product included 0.5 molecules of 4-methyl-2-pentanone per one molecule of the desired product. DSC analysis showed a sharp endothermic peak (66.8 J/G) at 137&deg; C., indicating that the product was crystals. TG-DTA analysis showed that crystals including 0.5 molecules of 4-methyl-2-pentanone after drying to its constant weight lost no weight until a temperature at which an endothermic reaction occurred (122 to 132&deg; C.), indicating that the solvent was not attached to the crystals. The product was analyzed by high performance chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse-phase octadecyl silica gel column using a mixture of acetonitrile/water (75/25) as an eluent and using a UV detector (254 nm), indicating a purity of 99.5%. A major impurity was 3&prime;,5&prime;-O-bis(4,4&prime;-dimethoxytrityl)thymidine with an HPLC peak area of 0.3%. An yield was 67%. </paragraph>
