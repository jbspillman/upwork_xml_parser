<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a method for the determination of reduction parameters for the subsequent adjustment of a reduction device in order to reduce the fragments of a fractured bone. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the field of osteosynthesis, bone fragments of a patient&apos;s fractured bone must often be correctly relocated. Only after such a correct relocation (reduction) of the bone fragments may a fixing device, such as an external or internal fixation, be applied in order to fix the bone fragments in a rigid position. In other applications, wherein the patient has a bone malformation for example, the bone or bones must be treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At present, the dislocation of fragments of fractured bones must be determined by means of X-ray imaging. When using or installing an external fixation, the corrections to be made through adjustment of the respective clamps and pins or screws is based upon on these X-ray images. The verification of the reduction of the fractured bone by means of the external fixation must be effected with subsequent X-ray imaging. This procedure may be cumbersome, especially in case of multiple steps of adjustment of the fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this regard, remedial measures are desired. A need exists for a method and a device based upon the comparison of the bone contour of the fractured bone with the corresponding healthy bone on the patient&apos;s healthy side of the body without using X-ray imaging. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention is related to a method for the determination of reduction parameters for the subsequent adjustment of a reduction device to reduce the fragments of a fractured bone, comprising the steps of: (A) comparing the contour of a first bone on a first side of a patient&apos;s body with respect to a corresponding second bone on the opposite side of the patient&apos;s body, wherein the first bone is a non-fractured bone and the second bone is a fractured bone; (B) determining the positions of a first set of points on the first bone, and establishing a three-dimensional coordinate system with respect to the body of the patient; (C) determining the positions of a second set of on the second bone within the coordinate system, wherein the second set of points corresponds to the first set of points; (D) establishing a plane of symmetry by dividing vectors between each point of the first set and its corresponding point of the second set in two parts, and defining central points of the vectors which define the plane of symmetry within the coordinate system; (E) generating a mirror image of the first bone symmetrically to the plane of symmetry by determining the positions of a third set of points on the first bone at each section corresponding to a fragment of the second bone and by forming the mirror image of the first bone by determining the positions of a fourth set of points that are symmetrical to the third set of points with respect to the plane of symmetry; (F) determining the positions of a fifth set of points on the second bone at each fragment section, wherein the fifth set of points corresponds to the third set of points on the first bone; and (G) determining the reduction parameters by comparing the different positions of the fifth set of points on the second bone with the positions of the fourth set of points within the mirror image. In one preferred embodiment, the second set of points includes at least three points situated on a proximal fragment of the bone. In one embodiment, a plane of symmetry containing an anterior-posterior axis and a proximal-distal axis is established by means of dividing the connecting vectors between each point and its corresponding point in two equal parts therewith defining central points of the vectors which determine three points of the plane of symmetry within the coordinate system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The coordinates are preferably measured within the coordinate system defined under step (B). The determination of the reduction parameters is then preferably executed by means of calculating the differences between the coordinates of the points at the fractured bone and the coordinates of the points within the mirror image in the medial-lateral direction, the anterior-posterior direction and the proximal-distal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the determination of the position of the points on the surface of the fractured and the non-fractured bone is performed by means of touching these points with the tip of a pointer which is provided with at least three markers whose position is determinable within an on-site three-dimensional coordinate system by means of an optical position measurement device and respective data management via a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The position measurement device may be an optical position measurement device, an acoustic position measurement device or an electromagnetic position measurement device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Corresponding to the mode of operation of the position measurement device, the markers attached to the pointer may be energy emitting, receiving or reflecting means.

Also, suitable energy receiving means that may be installed include: photodiodes; microphones; or hall-effect components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment according to the invention, the method comprises: (A) the determination of the position of the at least three points at the surface of one of the bones by means of fastening one reference bar through two screws or pins to the bone and determining a third point with an adjustable pin fastenable to the reference bar; (B) the determination of the position of the identical points at the surface of the other bone by means of fastening a second reference bar through two screws or pins to the other bone and determining the third point with an adjustable pin fastenable to the reference bar; and (C) the coordinates of the tips of the adjustable pins relative to particularly defined points on the reference bars are compared in order to estimate the reduction parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The method may also include: (A) the measurement of the reduction parameters relative to the medial-lateral plane by means of attaching one reference bar at the non-fractured bone in the medial-lateral plane and one reference bar at the fractured bone in the medial-lateral plane; (B) the measurement of the reduction parameters relative to the anterior-posterior plane by means of attaching one reference bar at the non-fractured bone, in the anterior-posterior plane and one reference bar at the fractured bone in the anterior-posterior plane; or (C) the measurement of the reduction parameters relative to the medial-lateral plane and relative to the anterior-posterior plane by means of attaching one reference bar each at the non-fractured bone in the medial-lateral plane and in the anterior-posterior plane and one reference bar each at the fractured bone in the medial lateral plane and in the anterior-posterior plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention is preferably performed by the surgeon as an additional step during planning and preparation of the surgical treatment of the fractured bone as for example the selection of an adequate reduction apparatus and method as well as adequate internal or external fixators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also disclosed is a device according to the invention comprising: a cylindric or prismatic reference bar having a longitudinal axis; clamps displaceable on the reference bar in the direction of the longitudinal axis and fastenable to the reference bar; screws or pins loosenable and fixable transversely to the reference bar within the clamps whereby the screws are screwable into the bone therewith attaching the reference bar to the bone; and one or more adjustable clamps to loosenably fasten one or more pins capable of being set with their tips to desired points on the surface of the bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention, the adjustable clamp is designed such that the tip of the pin is displaceable with three degrees of freedom therewith allowing to estimate the coordinates of the tip with respect to a three-dimensional coordinate system affixed to the reference bar. To realize this displaceability with three degrees of freedom the adjustable clamp comprises a socket, a post and a support whereby the support is slidable in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the post and the socket is slidable on the reference bar in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the reference bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably the post is arranged perpendicularly to the reference bar and the support is provided with a bore hole for acceptance of the pin and with an axis extending perpendicular to the post and the reference bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the device according to the invention, articulated pins may be provided to attach the reference bar to the bone. Preferably each articulated pin is provided with a thread at its end being introduced into the bone. At the joint of the articulated pin, a turning knuckle having one degree of freedom or a ball joint may be provided. The articulation is preferably loosenably fastenable. Advantageously, the invention preferably permits the reduction parameters of a fractured bone to be determined without the need of X-rays of the bone of interest.</paragraph>

The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises two adjustable clamps <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> each with one pin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Both devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are attached to the bones <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the lateral-medial plane of the patient and symmetrical to a plane defined as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The coordinates of the points of the tips <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the pins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be measured relative to the reference bar <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and compared. Furthermore, the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is provided with at least one articulated pin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Once the reduction parameters are determined, particularly the correction measurements of bone length and angulation of the bone fragments of the fractured bone, the correction may be performed by means of a reduction device. The correction of the position of the bone fragments preferably begins with the correction of the bone length (ordinary distraction) followed by the correction of the angulation of the bone fragments in both the horizontal and the distal planes. These corrections are performed until the same parameters, particularly the corresponding coordinates within the reference coordinate system are received. During this correction, the parameter data received from the non-fractured bone and transformed via the plane of symmetry (mirror) are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Finally, the clamps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are moved into the fracture level, one in the horizontal plane and one in the vertical plane. The tips of the pins assess the exact position of the fracture area in the horizontal and vertical planes. Particularly the assessment of any overdistraction is performed which is followed by fine corrections of small dislocations of the bone fragments. If a comminuted fracture is under procedure, the final reduction via the above pin is not performed. Subsequently, the measuring device is removed and the fixation of the bone can be performed. If an external fixation is intended to be applied, the frame of a high mobile external fixation is fixed to the end remote of the bone of these pins that were already used when performing the reduction with a reduction device. If internal fixation is performed, minimally invasive methods of osteosynthesis are recommended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> If the reduction device is computer controlled, a particular software program may be used to receive the reduction parameter data from the non-fractured bone of the patient and transform these data via the plane of symmetry (mirror) into the reduction measures and control the motors of the already attached reduction device. By means of the motors, the necessary corrections of the bone fragments is performed. Again the correction of the bone length (distraction) is performed first. Sensors at the reference bar, clamps, and pins transmit digital signals to the computer until the correction is completed. One pin can be introduced into each bone fragment and introduced in a clamp. Preferably, the pin should be mounted at a right angle to the surface of the bone to provide an easier or an automatic reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The automatic reduction device is preferably provided with a control system which comprises sensors for measuring a probable over strength between the bone and reduction device connections. When this strength exceeds the allowed level the computer can switch the motors off or return the reduction device to a previous position, thereby protecting bone and soft tissues from damage. After receiving this information, the computer analyzes again the position of the bone fragments, and the motors may be controlled in order to perform more distraction or prevent collision of the bone fragments. </paragraph>
