<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a garment adapted to support the breasts of an individual while wearing the garment. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a brassiere capable of being secured to an individual by a variety of straps formed in multiple configurations. The present invention is also directed to a method of securing the garment to the individual such that the garment may be worn in a supporting relationship with respect to the individual&apos;s breasts. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">THE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Brassieres, or bras as they are commonly referred to today, have evolved over the years along with styles of clothing and the perception of female attractiveness with respect to certain cultures. For example during the Renaissance Period, it was fashionable in the European culture to have a very exposed bustline. Thus, in response to this trend, dresses were made to expose a woman&apos;s bustline that was further accentuated by undergarments such as corsets that pushed the breasts up and together and pulled in the waistline. Some time after the Renaissance Period, small breasts were in style making the corset the fashionable item to wear. By contrast, in America during the early 1900s, the perception of female attractiveness was one that favored smaller, unexposed breasts, prompting the development and manufacture of corsets designed to flatten the breasts rather than enhance them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since the early 1900s, the perception of female attractiveness has essentially reversed itself in many cultures. In America, for example, many view large breasts and clothing that exposes the female bustline to be fashionable and equate this type of appearance with sexual attractiveness. Accordingly, the fashion industry has developed bras that enhance the female breasts and clothing to expose the bustline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, since the early 1900s, the fashion industry has also designed clothing that reveals more of the female body. One trendy or fashionable design that has been and remains popular among many women are articles of clothing that reveal the their backs, such as low-cut or backless clothing. For example, evening gowns, prom dresses, cocktail dresses, and the like that are low-cut in the back or backless are considered to be elegant by many men and women. The low-cut and backless look is also permeating into other types of clothing such as the backless halter-top which is considered among some of the trendy fashion items for the upcoming 2002 summer season. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The traditional or basic bra typically has two cups, a left cup for the left breast, and a right cup for the right breast, and four straps&mdash;two back straps and two shoulder straps. The two back straps are typically affixed to the bra cups to extend around the individual&apos;s torso with free ends that fasten at the back. The two shoulder straps are also usually affixed to the bra cups and extend over each shoulder and are affixed to a respective back strap. When worn with low-cut or backless articles of clothing, these four straps are usually exposed, which oftentimes detracts from the article of clothing. Accordingly, given the desire of many women to wear low-cut or backless articles of clothing, this basic bra design has had to evolve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One way in which the basic bra design has evolved is to eliminate the need for shoulder straps. Thus, the entire support for the female&apos;s breasts must be achieved through both the cup design and the back straps. This type of bra is commonly referred to as the strapless bra, which can be worn with clothing that exposes the female&apos;s shoulders. However, the back straps of the strapless bra are still exposed if worn with low-cut or backless clothing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Various efforts to design a bra that is both backless and strapless have been made. For example, Brazabar Corporation sells a bra having two disconnected breast cups without shoulder straps or back straps. The interior of each breast cup has an adhesive liner that allows the breast cups to be adhered to the breasts. Brazabar Corporation also makes a somewhat different backless, strapless bra in the form of two separate pieces of a tape-like adhesive material that sticks to the breasts. Unlike the first design described above, this second design lacks a structural breast cup framework, and is adapted to mold to the shape of the user. The wearer simply places the adhesive tape over the breasts to create a supported look. Finally, Brazabra Corporation also makes strap attachment accessories with hook and eye fasteners. These strap attachment accessories are designed to lengthen and pull down the back straps of the basic bra so as to conceal them from view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The strapless and backless bras described above have several drawbacks. First, the two types of adhesive cups do not offer the same amount of support that the traditional bra offers which places larger breasted women at somewhat of a disadvantage. Secondly, with respect to the back strap accessories item described, the straps do not always eliminate the appearance of the bra&apos;s back strap. Accordingly, there is a long felt need for a brassiere that is able to be worn with low-cut or backless articles of clothing that provides support for the individual&apos;s breasts in the same or similar way as a traditional or basic bra. The present invention is directed to meeting those needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and useful garment that supports an individual&apos;s breasts when worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a fashionable, versatile garment to support the wearer&apos;s breasts and that may be worn alone or as an accessory to a backless article of clothing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a garment to support an individual&apos;s breasts with adjustable components so that it may be either tightened or loosened as desired for its comfort or appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a comfortable brassiere with releasable shoulder straps and back straps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a support for an individual&apos;s breasts that permits the individual to secure the support on her body by means of any desired configuration of straps, cords, strands of beads, scarves or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to prove a support for an individual&apos;s breasts that is attractive and that accessorizes her outfit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, then, a garment is provided that is adapted to support an individual&apos;s breasts when worn. The garment may be in the form of a brassiere, a halter-top, a bathing suit, or the like. Broadly, the garment comprises a garment structure adapted to be placed in a supporting relationship with respect to the individual&apos;s breasts, and a garment support component with means for engaging the breast support piece so that it may be secured into a supporting relationship on the individual. To accomplish these means, the garment of the present invention broadly provides a garment structure in the form of a breast support piece that includes connectors, and a garment support component adapted to engage these connectors. The present invention contemplates a wide variety of designs for the breast support piece, connectors, and the garment support component, as well as a variety of ways in which they interact to create a new and useful garment as versatile as that which is the subject of this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The breast support piece generally includes a left section that is adapted to support the left breast and a right section adapted to support the right breast. When the breast support piece is placed in a supporting relationship to the individual&apos;s breasts, a left side edge extends laterally of the left breast, a right side edge extends laterally of the right breast, and a bottom edge extends below both breasts between the left and right side edges. In some embodiments, the breast support piece may also include a top edge that is spaced upwardly of the bottom edge and between the left and right side edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The breast support piece may be formed as an integral one-piece construction of fabric. Alternatively, the breast support piece may be in the form of breast cups having a respective interior concavity for receiving a respective breast and may optionally include an underwire structure. The breast support pieces may also be in the form of a framework that partially encircles the breasts and allows them to be exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The connectors that are engaged by the garment support component are disposed on the breast support piece. The breast support piece may simply include a set of first connectors chosen from a group consisting of hooks, eyes, buttons, openings, snaps, and rings. Members of this first set of connectors may each be of a different type of connector or, in the alternative, each member may be of the same type connector. In addition to the first connectors, the breast support piece may also include a set of second connectors. The members of the second set of connectors may be hooks, eyes, buttons, openings, snaps, and rings. Here again, the members of this second set of connectors are not confined to be just one type of connector, but they can each be a different type of connector. Further, the members of the first connectors and the members of the second connectors can either be the same type of connector or be a different type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first connectors and, if included, the second connectors, are spaced apart from one another on the breast support piece and are generally disposed proximately to the edges of the breast support piece. Thus, for example, on the left section of the breast support piece there may be a first connector disposed proximately to the bottom edge and a first connector located upwardly thereof that is disposed proximately to either the top or side edge of the left section. Likewise, with respect to the right section of the breast support piece, a first connector may be disposed on the bottom edge with another connector located upwardly thereof that is disposed proximately to either the top or side edge. The second connectors, if include, could be similarly situated on the breast support piece and located proximately to a respective member of the first connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The garment support component includes a means for engaging at least one connector and may be in the form of a strap, a strand of beads, and a scarf. The breast support piece may either be worn by one garment support component, or by a plurality of garment support components. The garment support component may also include a fastening element thereon to cooperate either with another garment support component or to enable it to fasten to itself to keep the breast piece in a supporting relationship on the individual. Further, the garment support component may also include a means by which its length may be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates that a wide variety of configurations may be formed by the garment support components that may be arranged in numerous ways to form shoulder straps and back straps. In some configurations, each garment support component may be entirely releasable from the breast support piece. Alternatively, one end of the garment support component may be affixed to the breast support piece while the other end remains free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention further contemplates a garment system adapted to support an individual&apos;s breasts when worn. The garment system is comprised of a backless article of clothing that includes two lateral side edges and a front panel extending therebetween. Each lateral side edge has an opening disposed in a margin proximate to each respective lateral side edge. The garment system also includes a breast support piece with connectors disposed thereon and at least one garment support component. The garment support component of this garment system is adapted to engage at least one of the breast support piece connectors and further adapted to extend through the openings of the article of clothing to secure both it and the breast support piece onto the individual. In one form, the backless article of clothing can be a dickey. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Finally, the present invention also includes a method for securing a garment to an individual&apos;s body that is adapted to support the breasts of the individual when worn. The steps include placing a breast support piece with connectors disposed thereon over the breasts, and using at least one garment support component to secure the breast support piece in a supporting relationship with respect to the individual&apos;s breasts. The method further includes the step of using a plurality of garment support members to engage to secure the breast support piece by forming multiple configurations of the garment support components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily appreciated and understood from the consideration of the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments when taken together with the accompany drawings, in which:</paragraph>
