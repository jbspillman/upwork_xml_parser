<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rubber composition for tire tread and a pneumatic tire using the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to a rubber composition for tire tread having remarkably improved grip performance on wet road while maintaining processability and fuel efficiency, and a pneumatic tire using the rubber composition for the tread rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a wide variety of properties such as steering stability, abrasion resistance, riding comfort characteristics as well as fuel efficiency have been required for automobile tires and various ideas are suggested in order to improve these performances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, it is tried to improve grip performance on road for the purpose of improving controllability and steering stability on wet road at high-speed running, or to improve cornering properties by increasing block stiffness of tire tread pattern and then preventing block deformation in case of cornering. It is also devised to inhibit deformation of groove so that excellent drainage is achieved to prevent hydroplaining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, grip performance on wet road is increased by compounding silica to a high styrene-content styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) in order to meet the demand for such properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, it is said that the above rubber composition for tire tread cannot exhibit sufficient grip performance on wet road or semi-wet road in high temperature range of over 15&deg; C., though the grip performance can be increased in low temperature range of at most 15&deg; C. Furthermore, it has been found that when running is carried on, the rubber composition containing silica shows decrease of rubber rigidity, resulting in remarkable decrease of grip performance. In addition, when dispersion of silica particles into rubber is insufficient, Mooney viscosity of the rubber composition is increased, causing problems that processability such as extrusion is poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to solve these problems, various suggestions have been made so far. For example, there are a rubber composition obtained by compounding sintered clay to a diene rubber; a rubber composition obtained by compounding vulcanized rubber powder comprising a diene rubber and kaolinite to a particular diene rubber; a rubber composition obtained by compounding an inorganic filler of a particular composition and carbon black to SBR containing a particular amount of styrene; and a rubber composition obtained by compounding clay comprising kaolinite as a main component to a diene rubber whose 1,2-bond content in butadiene part is in a particular range. It is now known that these rubber compositions have an effect on improvement of grip performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, at present, no rubber composition has yet been produced, which has excellent wet grip performance while maintaining low heat build-up characteristics without lowering of processability and abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, both grip performance and rolling resistance (fuel efficiency) are properties related to hysteresis loss of a rubber. Generally, the larger the hysteresis loss is, the higher the grip performance is and the more improved the controllability is, but rolling resistance is increased at the same time, resulting in increase of fuel consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this way, grip performance and rolling resistance are incompatible, and therefore various rubber compositions for tire are suggested in order to achieve both properties simultaneously. For example, since polymers and carbon black have particular influence on both properties in the rubber composition for tire, it is tried to improve both the rolling resistance and the grip performance by suitably selecting the rate of combined styrene and the 1,2-bond content of butadiene part when a styrene-butadiene copolymer is used as a polymer. And in case of carbon black, the amount of carbon black is reduced or the particle diameter of carbon black is enlarged. In these methods, however, it is difficult to achieve compatibility between low heat build-up characteristics and reinforcing property, and abrasion resistance. Accordingly, carbon black whose activity degree of particle surface is optimized is used at present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there are many reports on the method of using silica and a silane coupling agent in order to achieve low heat build-up characteristics. However, it has been found that, when running is carried on, the rubber composition containing silica shows decrease of rubber rigidity, resulting in remarkable decrease of grip performance. In addition, when dispersion of silica particles into rubber is insufficient, the rubber composition containing silica has increased Mooney viscosity, causing a problem that processability such as extrusion is poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For solving these problems, various suggestions have been made so far. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 133375/1995 and 311245/1996 disclose a rubber composition obtained by compounding sintered clay to a diene rubber, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3373/1996 discloses a rubber composition obtained by compounding a vulcanized rubber powder comprising a diene rubber and kaolinite to a particular diene rubber, describing effect on improvement of grip performance and the like. Moreover, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 59893/1996 and 59894/1996 disclose a rubber composition obtained by compounding an inorganic filler of a particular composition and carbon black to SBR containing a particular amount of styrene, while Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 149954/1995 and 31250/1997 disclose a rubber composition obtained by compounding clay comprising kaolinite as a main component to a diene rubber whose 1,2-bond content in butadiene part is in a particular range, and similar effect is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In spite of these efforts, surface properties of inorganic fillers such as silica have a significant influence on rubber composition and often prevent the intended performance from being achieved to a remarkable degree. For example, since a silanol group, i.e., the surface functional group of silica forms a hydrogen bond, silica particles tend to coagulate with each other, causing problems such as lowering of mechanical strength and weakening of materials as well as remarkable decrease of workability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to solve these problems, it has been tried to use various coupling agents, dispersion agents or surface modifiers. For example, it is considered that a sliane coupling agent combines to silanol group on the silica surface to prevent silica particles from coagulating with each other, resulting in improvement of processability. However, silane coupling agents are expensive, and can combine to some limited kinds of inorganic compounds such as silica, glass fiber and alumina owing to the characteristics of its functional group, and there has been a problem that the silane coupling agent is not effective for poorly reactive compounds such as titanium oxide, calcium carbonate, carbon black and graphite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other inexpensive dispersion agents or surfactants for inorganic compounds include an anionic, cationic or nonionic low molecular weight surfactant and fatty acid, but they have a problem that covering ability for inorganic compound is poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the fact is that there is no rubber composition at present, which has excellent wet grip performance and improved dispersability of inorganic fillers while maintaining abrasion resistance and low heat build-up characteristics without lowering of workability and processability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention is explained in detail below. </paragraph>

More preferably, the upper limit of the amount of styrene units is 40% by weight and the lower limit is 25% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The inorganic filler used in the present invention is represented by the formula (I): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>kM<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>.xSiO<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>.zH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&emsp;&emsp;(I) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> in which M<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>is at least one metal, an oxide thereof or a hydroxide thereof, said metal being selected from the group consisting of Al, Mg, Ti and Ca, k is an integer of 1 to 5, x is an integer of 0 to 10, y is an integer of 2 to 5 and z is an integer of 0 to 10. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Sample rubber compositions were obtained by kneading and compounding based on the compounding recipe described in Table 1. The compounds were press-vulcanized at 170&deg; C. for 20 minutes to obtain vulcanized materials. Each of the obtained materials was subjected to the following property tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> (Abrasion Test) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Using a Lambourne abrasion tester, the Lambourne abrasion amount was measured under the condition of 20&deg; C., a slip ratio of 20% and testing time of 5 minutes. The volume loss of each compound was calculated and indexed to the loss of Comparative Example 1 as 100 according to the following equation (abrasion index). The larger the index is, the more excellent the abrasion resistance is. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(abrasion index)&equals;(loss of Comparative Example 1) &divide;(loss of each compound)&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> (Rolling Resistance Index) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The loss tangent (tan &dgr;) of each compound was measured by using a viscoelasticity spectrometer VES (made by Iwamoto Corporation) under the condition of 70&deg; C., initial strain of 10% and dynamic strain of 2%. The loss tangent was indexed to tan &dgr; of Comparative Example 1 as 100 according to the following equation (rolling resistance index). The larger the index is, the more excellent the rolling resistance is. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(rolling resistance index)&equals;(tan &dgr; of Comparative Example 1)&divide;(tan &dgr; of each compound)&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> (Wet Skid Test) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The wet skid resistance was measured according to the method of ASTM E303-83 using a portable skid tester made by Stanley Inc. The wet skid resistance was indexed to the measured value of Comparative Example 1 as 100 based on the following equation (wet skid index). The larger the index is, the more excellent the wet skid performance is. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(wet skid index)&equals;(wet skid resistance of each compound)&divide;(wet skid resistance of Comparative Example 1)&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (Mooney Viscosity) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The Mooney viscosity was measured at 130&deg; C. in accordance with the measuring method of JIS K6300. The Mooney viscosity was indexed to the Mooney viscosity of Comparative Example 1 (ML<highlight><subscript>1&plus;4</subscript></highlight>) as 100 based on the following equation (Mooney viscosity index). The larger the value is, the lower the Mooney viscosity is and the more excellent the processability is. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(Mooney viscosity index)&equals;(ML<highlight><subscript>1&plus;4 </subscript></highlight>of Comparative Example 1)&divide;(ML<highlight><subscript>1&plus;4 </subscript></highlight>of each compound) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> (Appearance of Rubber Surface) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The sheet condition of each compound was visually observed immediately after the knead-extrusion and evaluated based on the following criteria. The worse the sheet condition is, the lower the workability is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> &xcirc;: Sheet condition is excellent </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> &Dgr;: Uneveness is observed </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Table 3 shows that the rubber composition of Comparative Example 6 obtained by compounding silica instead of part of carbon black together with a silane coupling agent has inferior reinforcing property and decreased abrasion resistance though low heat build-up characteristics and grip performance thereof are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> It is found that the rubber composition of Comparative Example 7 obtained by compounding aluminum oxide instead of part of carbon black, and the rubber composition of Comparative Example 8 obtained by aluminum oxide instead of part of carbon black together with a polyether compound have inferior reinforcing property and decreased abrasion resistance as well, though low heat build-up characteristics and grip performance thereof are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as to the rubber compositions of Examples 11 to 14 obtained by compounding silica and aluminum oxide instead of part of carbon black together with a silane coupling agent and a polyether compound, improvement of low heat build-up characteristics and grip performance was achieved without lowering abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Table 4 shows that the rubber composition of Comparative Example 9 obtained by compounding clay instead of part of carbon black, the rubber compositions of Comparative Examples 10 to 12 obtained by compounding clay instead of part of carbon black together with a silane coupling agent, a polyether compound, or silica and a silane coupling agent, respectively, have inferior reinforcing property and decreased abrasion resistance though low heat build-up characteristics and grip performance thereof are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as to the rubber compositions of Examples 17 to 20 obtained by compounding silica and clay instead of part of carbon black together with a silane coupling agent and a polyether compound, improvement of low heat build-up characteristics and grip performance was achieved without lowering abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to produce a rubber composition having excellent processability, abrasion resistance, low heat build-up characteristics, rolling resistance and wet skid performance, and a pneumatic tire using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In addition, since a silane coupling agent having less sulfur atoms in the sulfide part is compounded to the rubber composition of the present invention, there is no problem that the Mooney viscosity is increased to decrease processability even at high temperature kneading. </paragraph>
