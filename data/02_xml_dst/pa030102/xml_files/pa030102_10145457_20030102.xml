<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to scheduling systems, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a multi-facility reservation scheduling system whose implementation and manipulation are handled over global, wide-area, or local-area communications networks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many service-related industries, there exists a need to accommodate the schedules of clients who wish to utilize a plurality of services possibly at a multitude of facilities. Hotel clients often choose a hotel based on the amenities that are provided on site or in the vicinity of the hotel. A client may for example desire a suite or that the hotel have a pool. Similarly in the convention industry, different facilities can provide a vast array of services. For example, a client may wish to schedule a convention site based upon the amount of space it has available or its location or possibly on the convention site&apos;s ability to accommodate audiovisual presentations. Current methods of scheduling this procedure require a phone conversation with a scheduler at the facility that will provide the service. Since the service could potentially be performed at a variety of sites, the current method could require numerous attempts to contact a variety of facilities before scheduling a reservation at a facility which has the resources (i.e., room or conference room availability) necessary to provide the service at a time which accommodates the client&apos;s scheduling needs. Given the jumbling of locations, services offered at each location, and variables such as room availability or client preferences, scheduling each location&apos;s resources for maximum effectiveness can prove to be burdensome, particularly given the vast amount of data associated with each client&apos;s reservation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Previous attempts have been made to provide systems through which the scheduling of remote locations may be achieved. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,403 to Gabriner et al (the &apos;<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> patent) describes a genetic algorithm scheduling system which includes a system of encoding and testing hard constraint information. The general scheduling system has information about the scheduling problem, in the form of the resources available for performing tasks, a description of the tasks to be performed, and information about the problem domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,842,173 to Strum et al. (the &apos;<highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> patent) describes a computer-based surgical services management system for communicating between sites of a surgical services facility. The system includes repeaters, remote access via modems, data archives, reactive and predictive scheduling, analysis, data maintenance, telephone communications. U.S. Pat. No. 5,748,907 to Crane (the &apos;<highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> patent) describes a real-time medical facility management system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,353 to Pinsky et al. (the &apos;<highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> patent) describes a network for providing medical interpretations of radiological images on a national or regional basis. U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,605 to Chapman et al. (the &apos;<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> patent) describes a system for managing process flow information related to a multiplicity of interrelated organizational tasks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,289,531 to Levine (the &apos;<highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> patent) describes an electronic rescheduler for promptly and efficiently rescheduling appointments in a two-part procedure. The first step includes the selection of one or more time periods during which a new appointment would be desired, and in the second step a new appointment is chosen from the selected time periods. The system is telephonically-driven. U.S. Pat. No. 5,301,105 to Cummings, Jr. (the &apos;<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> patent) describes a health care management system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,380 to Levine (the &apos;<highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> patent) describes an electronic rescheduler. U.S. Pat. No. 5,065,315 to Garcia (the &apos;<highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> patent) describes a hospital computerized system for entering information pertinent to a patient&apos;s stay in the hospital. U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,743 to Rassman et al (the &apos;<highlight><bold>743</bold></highlight> patent) describes a method and system for the prospective scheduling, monitoring and management of resources using a computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> None of the foregoing systems, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, provides a system which utilizes technology offering access to each of the remote locations via a global communications network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> None of the foregoing systems provides an efficient system for making a reservation from multiple facilities, each of which facilities includes multiple resources for providing a variety of client services, such as convention space availability, room availability, spa facilities and a pool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there is a need in the art for a computer implemented multi-facility scheduling system which enables a remote scheduler to arrange client reservations for a variety of services to be provided at a variety of facilities in an efficient, cost-effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is a further need in the art for a multi-facility scheduling system to permit a client, or a person acting on the client&apos;s behalf, to obtain a variety of scheduling options in order to effectively and efficiently schedule reservations available at a variety of locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a further need in the art for a multi-facility scheduling system which can also be manipulated on a facility-by-facility basis, with interaction among the various facilities via an electronic communications mechanism such as, for example, the global communications network known as the Internet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like elements throughout the several views, in a preferred embodiment the scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention allows a client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to contact, via computer implementation, any one of an organization&apos;s <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> multiple facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to schedule a reservation. A facility is a physical site, such as a hotel, motel, or convention center. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may either be the client <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or the client&apos;s representative <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as in the case of a booking agent seeking a specific type of facility for a customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An organization <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the service provider whose multiple facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are accessible using the computer-implemented scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Each organization <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may group its facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, using remote scheduling servers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, so as to permit access to each facility&apos;s <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> schedules. For instance, facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is independently connected to a scheduling server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are collectively connected to a scheduling server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The distinction between these types of groupings is that the server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can only access scheduling information for facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while the server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>can access all three of these facilities&apos;scheduling information. The scheduling information maintained on the various servers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is accessible via an electronic communications link <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> between the servers and, for example, a global communications network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Access to each organization&apos;s <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> collective scheduling information begins at the scheduling system&apos;s <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> central schedule servers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. When the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wishes to schedule a reservation, the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connects to the scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by connecting to one of the central schedule servers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via the electronic transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which network may take the form of the Internet, a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) or even a telephone call. The client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, by entering a predetermined access code, is able to access an organization&apos;s facilities. Once the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> accesses a specific organization, the scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prompts the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide client information for the purpose of scheduling a reservation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Client information includes personal data about the client, such as the client&apos;s name, address, telephone number, and the like; service data, such as the space requirements, room requirements and facility capability stipulations; payment data, such as the client&apos;s credit card information; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> and client reservation preference data, such as the preferred date, time, and specific location where the client would like to schedule a reservation. The scheduling system confirms the information received from the client with the client and verifies certain of the information, such as for instance the client&apos;s payment information, (as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> at reference number <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>), by communicating, via means familiar to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art, with sources of such information, such as the credit card company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once the scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives the packet of client information from the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it compares the service data to an existing set of service constraints in order to determine any constraints on the scheduling of a reservation for the client. For instance, if a client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wishes to schedule a conference that requires an auditorium, facilities without an auditorium will be excluded or segregated from the candidate list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Once the central scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> generates the reservation scheduling limitations, the limitations and the client reservation preferences are utilized in order to generate a predetermined number of reservation candidates. The central scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> communicates the requests to the remote schedule servers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which actually generate the candidates and pass them back to the central server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Each remote schedule server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> generates reservation candidate using data from the particular facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to which each remote server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has access. Thus, the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> generates the reservation candidates by communicating with the organization&apos;s remote schedule servers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which in turn communicate with the organization&apos;s facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, to determine which of the facilities are available to provide the requisite services at the preferred date and time. The availability and downtime of the facility and resources is considered during the scheduling process. The operating hours of the facility, rooms and equipment, and the working hours of the staff contribute to the determination of availability. A scheduling restriction at a particular date and time, such as preventive maintenance or a staff meeting, is defined as downtime. Availability masks are specified to define when an entity is available. An availability mask consists of the start time, frequency, day of week, and duration. For example, for a facility with operating hours of 9 am to 7 pm Monday through Friday, and 9 am to 12 pm on Saturday, a mask is created for each weekday beginning at 9 am for 10 hours, and one for Saturday beginning at 9 am for 3 hours. A duration is defined for each reservation. Therefore, the scheduling process considers the following issues when attempting to schedule a reservation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Resources required by the client </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Availability masks defined for the facility </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Availability masks defined for the resources required by procedures in the schedule group </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Existing reservations for the resources required by the client </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Client&apos;s preferred reservation time and place </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> communicate their availability back to the central scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via their respective remote schedule servers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> then communicates the various reservation candidates directly to the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wishes to select one of the reservation candidates, the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so notifies the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. If the client does not want to select any of the reservation candidates, an alternative set of reservation candidates is generated in the same manner as the initial set of candidates. Upon receipt of the client&apos;s notification as to which reservation candidate the client wishes to select, the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> communicates the notification to the selected facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, via the facility&apos;s remote schedule server. The schedule server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then generates information related to the selected reservation, including the client information, the service constraints, the reservation date and time, the facility at which the reservation will occur, and the specific resources to be utilized at the facility during the reservation. Resources include the specific room to be utilized for the reservation, along with the staff and equipment required to fulfill the reservation. Staff denotes the technical, professional, or administrative staff whom are represented within the facility. Equipment denotes the types of machinery or apparatus located within the facility. The scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then reports all of the reservation information to the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at which the service will be performed, and a portion of this information&mdash;the client information, the reservation date and time, and the facility&apos;s identity&mdash;to the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and confirms the reservation with the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at which the reservation is scheduled to occur. In connection with the scheduling of the reservation, a unique reservation number is transmitted to both the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at which the reservation is scheduled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention also includes the capability of handling the rescheduling or canceling of previously-scheduled reservations. A client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may connect to the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via the method discussed above and, once connected, may notify the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of his reservation number, at which time the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will locate the reservation information generated when the reservation was scheduled. Once the reservation information is retrieved, the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will provide the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with options regarding the reservation, including without limitation confirmation, cancellation, and modification. If the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wishes to cancel the reservation, the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will notify the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at which the reservation is scheduled to occur, in order that the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can remove whatever restrictions were placed upon it, in terms of resources, by the scheduling of the reservation, thus freeing up those resources for a different client&apos;s use. Should the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> wish to reschedule the reservation, the scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will obtain from the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a new set of client reservation preference data and will, in the same manner described above, generate a new set of reservation candidates from which the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may select in order to reschedule his reservation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the scheduling system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is also capable of allocating facilities and resources to clients who seek and/or receive services without a reservation, i.e., walk-in clients <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and of reallocating facilities and resources in situations where clients with scheduled reservations to not appear for their reservations without canceling their reservations. When such situations occur, personnel at the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> affected by the walk-in or no-show enter into the facility&apos;s remote schedule server <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> appropriate information pertaining to the resources encumbered (in the case of a walk-in) or available (in the case of a no-show), and this information is in turn transmitted via the electronics communications network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the central scheduling server <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Looking at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, once the reservation is generated and confirmed with the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the reservation information can also be made available for export to an external system <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, such as a billing program. For example, once the reservation is generated, the client information, including payment information, can be integrated into an organization&apos;s billing program so that the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is appropriately billed for the services rendered at the facility <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at the time of the reservation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating a typical operation of the scheduling system of the present invention. In steps <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, the reservation candidates are generated. Once steps <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> occur, and the system generates a set of reservation candidates, steps <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> repeatedly determine if the client has selected a reservation candidate. In step <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, once the client selects a reservation candidate, the reservation information is generated, and in step <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the reservation information is transmitted, as discussed above, to the client and facility. In step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the reservation information is transmitted to the external system <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for integration into another application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the scheduling system of the present invention, the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can access multiple organizations <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the purpose of scheduling reservations at any of the multiple organizations&apos;multiple facilities <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. For example, one organization <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may consist of <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> facilities and a second organization <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may consist of <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> different facilities. Under the alternative embodiment of the present invention, the client <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, either directly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or through his representative <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, may access scheduling information from both organizations and therefore schedule a reservation based upon the availability of up to ten (10) different facilities. Under such a scenario, the various organizations&apos; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> scheduling information is compiled in a consolidation server <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> are a flow chart illustrating the steps required by a user to book a hotel reservation using the method of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, interaction between the user and the system implementing the method is accomplished via the Internet, a local area network, or a wide area network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the user inputs preliminary search criteria such as the city and state where the hotel reservation is needed, and the arrival and departure dates to the hotel. Next, in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, the user inputs the search method the user is interested in. Different search methods available can include, without limitation, searching for a hotel near an address, a hotel near an airport or a hotel near a point of interest such as a local tourist attraction. Search options relevant to the selected search method can then be selected in step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to further refine the search query. Once the query has been fully specified, it is tested for ambiguities in step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to ensure that an accurate search is performed. A typical ambiguity which can be discovered during this check includes, for example, multiple cities that match the name entered by the user. If an ambiguity is identified, in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> the user is presented with a list of the possible choices which can resolve the ambiguity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once the search query has been finalized and tested, in step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> the user is presented with a list of hotels which match the search criteria. The user may optionally request additional information on one or more of the displayed facilities (<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>). If the choices displayed to the user are unacceptable, or if no choices are shown because there are no hotels matching the search criteria, the user may elect to run a new search (<highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, the user may select one of the hotels in the displayed list (<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once a user has selected a hotel matching the search criteria, the user is presented with a second list containing the available room types at the selected facility meeting the search criteria (<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). If none of the room choices are acceptable, the user may elect, in step <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to return to the hotel list and possibly select a new hotel or run a new search. If the user finds the room choices acceptable, the user can then select one of the room choices shown (<highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>) and will then be shown the booking policies for the particular room. The policies include such information as, advance reservation requirements, cancellation deadlines, and cancellation charges. If these policies are acceptable to the user she can proceed with the booking of the room (<highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, if the booking policy does not meet the user&apos;s approval, the user can elect to be returned to the hotel list and possibly select a new hotel or run a new search. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the user elects to proceed with the reservation, the user will be requested to log into the system by providing a user ID and password (<highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>). It is envisioned in this example that the user will have registered previously and will have provided log in information during registration. Once logged in, the user can select a payment method, such as a credit card, which has been previously provided during registration, or can enter new payment instructions (<highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>). Once the payment information has been entered, the user is presented with a display (<highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>) of the reservation which is about to be booked and is asked to confirm that all, of the information displayed is correct (<highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>). If the reservation information is confirmed by the user, the reservation is booked (<highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>) and a final display is shown with reservation confirmation information (<highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>). If no confirmation is received from the user, the process is terminated without booking a reservation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the user inputs preliminary search criteria such as the city and state where the convention is to be held, and the start and end dates of the convention. Next, in step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the user inputs the search method the user is interested in. Different search methods available can include, without limitation, searching for a venue near an address, a venue near an airport or a venue near a point of interest such as an attraction relevant to attendees of the convention. Search options relevant to the selected search method can then be selected in step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> to further refine the search query. Options of particular relevance to a user booking a convention include, without limitation, minimum and maximum size of rooms available at the venue, availability of hotel rooms in the vicinity of the venue, price range, services available to convention organizers, and the like. Once the query has been fully specified, it is tested for ambiguities in step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to ensure that an accurate search is performed. A typical ambiguity which can be discovered during this check includes, for example, multiple cities that match the name entered by the user.
