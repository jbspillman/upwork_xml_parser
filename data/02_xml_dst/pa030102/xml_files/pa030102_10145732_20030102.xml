<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No.2001-145801, which was filed on May 16, 2001, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to latent curing agents for epoxy resin, and to a curable epoxy resin compositions which contain such an agent. More precisely, the present invention relates to latent, epoxy resin-curing agents that exhibit good storage stability and low-temperature rapid curability of epoxy resin compositions containing it, and relates to curable epoxy resin compositions which contain such an agent and exhibit good storage stability and low-temperature rapid curability. The present invention further relates to methods for preparing articles by curing such an epoxy resin composition and the articles thereby obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recent remarkable developments in electronics have made it possible to greatly increase the degree of integration of semiconductor IC chips and have enabled mass-scale production of IC devices. With that, small-sized, thin and high-quality electronic appliances now enjoy great popularity. With the recent popularization of such electronic appliances, one important problem is how to increase the mass-scale productivity of the products and to lower the production costs thereof. Epoxy resin compositions are used as the adhesive for electronic appliances, and they require a latent, epoxy resin-curing agent. However, it is much desired to further improve the quality of the curing agent. Needless-to-say, however, the applications of epoxy resins are not limited to the electronic industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Epoxy resin compositions are grouped into two types. One type is a two-package composition in which the main component epoxy resin and a curing agent are mixed just before use, and the other type is a one-package composition in which the main component epoxy resin is previously mixed with a curing agent. The latter one-package composition is preferred for the reason that it is free from the problems associated with incorrect mixing of the constituent components and it is applicable to automation lines driven by machine. One-package epoxy resin compositions require a curing agent which does not react with an epoxy resin compound at room temperature but, when heated, starts to react with the epoxy compound to cure it. This type of curing agent is referred to as a latent curing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some latent curing agents for epoxy resin have been proposed. Typical examples are dicyandiamides, dibasic acid dihydrazides, boron trifluoride amine complexes, guanamines, melamines, and imidazoles. Epoxy resin compositions prepared by mixing any of dicyandiamides, melamines, or guanamines with an epoxy compound have good storage stability, however they require long term curing at a high temperature not lower than 150&deg; C. Combining the composition with a cure accelerator to shorten the curing time is one general technique in the art. The cure accelerator is effective for shortening the curing time of epoxy resin compositions containing it, however its addition significantly reduces the storage stability of the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Epoxy resin compositions containing a latent curing agent selected from a group consisting of dibasic acid dihydrazides and imidazoles can cure at relatively low temperatures, however their storage stability is not good. Boron trifluoride amine complexes are corrosive and have some negative influences on the properties of the cured products of epoxy resin compositions containing them. Under these circumstances, a latent curing agent for epoxy resin that produces epoxy resin compositions having good storage stability and low-temperature rapid curability is highly desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve the problems mentioned above, a curing agent of a dialkylamine adduct with an epoxy compound is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 155222/1981 and 100127/1982; and a curing agent of an aminoalcohol or an aminophenol adduct with an epoxy resin is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 53526/1984. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,066,625 and 4,268,656 disclose a curing agent of an imidazole compound or an N-methylpiperazine with an epoxy compound added to its secondary amino group. However, the curing agents produced according to the methods disclosed are problematic in that, when they are added to epoxy resin compositions to improve the low-temperature curability of the compositions, they reduce the storage stability of the compositions and therefore shorten the shelf life or the pot life of adhesives and coating materials that contain the epoxy resin composition. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 296525/1991 discloses a one-package epoxy resin composition that contains a curing agent prepared through thermal reaction of an epoxide having more than one epoxy group on average in the molecule, an N,N-dialkylaminoalkylamine, a cyclic amine with an active hydrogen-containing nitrogen atom in the molecule, and a diisocyanate. However, the epoxy resin composition proposed in this publication is still unsatisfactory in view of its low-temperature curability and storage stability. Moreover, nothing is disclosed in these prior art references about to the curability of the composition at a temperature of 70&deg; C. or lower. Thus, there remains a need for improved latent curing agents for epoxy resin compositions which afford epoxy resin compositions which exhibit improved shelf or pot life and may be cured at low temperatures. There also remains a need for epoxy resin compositions which contain such a latent curing agent and for methods for preparing article by curing such an epoxy resin composition. </paragraph>

More preferred are tertiary amino group-containing, aliphatic primary amine compounds, and polyphenol compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When an epoxy resin is reacted with such an active hydrogen compound, a monofunctional glycidyl ether compound such as butyl glycidyl ether or phenyl glycidyl ether, a monofunctional glycidyl ester compound such as glycidyl benzoate, or a monoepoxy compound such as styrene oxide may be added thereto, if desired. </paragraph>

If the softening point of the polymer of the component (B) is higher than 150&deg; C., the low-temperature curability of the epoxy resin composition will be extremely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The latent curing agent for epoxy resin of the present invention comprises a solid solution containing the two components (A) and (B). Even though the components have a low softening point and are therefore difficult to grind individually, their solid solution can be readily ground into fine powder and can be uniformly dispersed in an epoxy resin composition. Even if the component (A) alone can be ground and added to an epoxy resin composition, the resulting mixture could not be uniformly cured since the component (A) is poorly miscible with the epoxy resin composition. When the component (A) is combined with the component (B) and forms a solid solution, the solid solution is well miscible with an epoxy resin composition and the epoxy resin composition containing the solid solution can be uniformly cured. On the other hand, the component (B), if added alone to an epoxy resin composition, could not improve both the low-temperature curability and the storage stability of the epoxy resin composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In producing the components (A) and (B), a solvent may be used or not, depending on the properties of the starting compounds to be reacted. The solvent is not specifically defined and may be any conventional one. However, if too much solvent remains in the solid solution of components (A) and (B), the properties of the cured product of the epoxy resin composition will be lowered. Therefore, solvents with high-boiling-point are unfavorable. For example, the solvent may be water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone; esters such as ethyl acetate; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene. For producing the solid solution of the components (A) and (B), various methods are applicable. For example, the components (A) and (B) may be separately prepared, and may be dissolved in a solvent that dissolves the two, and the solvent may be removed from the resulting solution; or the two components may be heated up to a temperature at which they melt, and then kneaded in melt; or any one of the two components may be first prepared, and the other component may be produced in the presence of the previously-prepared component. Depending on the properties of the respective components, suitable methods are selected for producing the solid solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The ratio of the component (A) to the component (B), i.e. (A)/(B), can be between 1/20 and 3/1 by weight. If the ratio of the component (A) is smaller than 1/20, the low-temperature curability of the epoxy resin composition containing the curing agent will be poor, and the composition will fail to attain the advantages of the present invention. On the other hand, if the ratio of the component (A) is larger than 3/1, the storage stability of the epoxy resin composition will be poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The solid solution of the invention may be solid at 25&deg; C. If not solid at 25&deg; C., the solid solution will be extremely difficult to be ground, and even if ground, it might not be stored and handled at room temperature and can not be mixed to an epoxy resin composition. Preferably, the softening point of the solid solution falls between 40&deg; C. and 150&deg; C. If the softening point thereof is lower than 40&deg; C., the storage stability of the epoxy resin composition containing the curing agent will be poor; but if higher than 150&deg; C., the low-temperature curability of the resin composition will be poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The solid solution of the present invention may contain any other component(s) not adversely affecting the advantages of the present invention. For example, conventional compounds known as a curing agent or a cure accelerator for epoxy resin, such as imidazole compounds including 2-methylimidazole, 1,2-dimethylimidazole, 1-benzyl-2-phenylimidazole, 1-(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)-2-methylimidazole; tertiary amine compounds including 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol; phosphine compounds including triphenyl phosphine, may be added in the solid solution, so far as not adversely affecting the advantages of the present invention. The solvent and the catalyst used in producing the components (A) and (B) as well as the non-reacted compounds remaining in the produced components may also exist in the solid solution, so far as not adversely affecting the advantages of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The solid solution comprised in the curing agent of the present invention is generally ground into particles having a desired particle size for use. The particle size thereof may be from 0.03 &mgr;m to 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When put on the market, the latent curing agent for epoxy resin of the present invention may further contain, if desired, any known curing agent of, for example, dicyandiamides, hydrazide compounds, guanamine compounds or phenol-novolak resins, as well as other additives such as surface-treating agents, inorganic fillers and pigments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention provides curable epoxy resin compositions, which comprises an epoxy compound having at least two epoxy groups in the molecule and the latent curing agent for epoxy resin of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The epoxy resin may be a compound having at least two epoxy groups in the molecule. It includes all known epoxy resins, for example, glycidyl ethers obtained through reaction of polyphenols, such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, hexahydrobisphenol A, tetramethylbisphenol A, diallylbisphenol A, hydroquinone, catechol, resorcinol, cresol, tetrabromo bisphenol A, trihydroxybiphenyl, benzophenone, bisresorcinol, bisphenol-hexafluoroacetone, tetramethylbisphenol A, tetramethylbisphenol F, tris(hydroxyphenyl)methane, bixylenol, phenol-novolak or cresol-novolak, with epichlorohydrin; polyglycidyl ethers obtained through reaction of aliphatic polyhydric alcohols, such as glycerin, neopentyl glycol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, with epichlorohydrin; glycidyl ether esters obtained through reaction of hydroxycarboxylic acids such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid or &bgr;-hydroxynaphthoic acid, with epichlorohydrin; polyglycidyl esters obtained from polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, methylphthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, endomethylene-tetrahydrophthalic acid, endomethylene- hexahydrophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, poly fatty acid; glycidylaminoglycidyl ethers obtained from aminophenols or aminoalkylphenols; glycidylaminoglycidyl esters obtained from aminobenzoic acid; glycidylamines obtained from aniline, toluidine, tribromoaniline, xylylenediamine, diamino cyclohexane, bisaminomethylcyclohexane, 4,4&prime;-diaminodiphenyl methane or 4,4&prime;-diaminodiphenyl sulfone; alicyclic epoxy resins such as 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate; and polyolefin epoxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The amount of the latent curing agent for epoxy resin of the present invention to be used in the epoxy resin composition of the present invention may be from 0.3 to 50 parts by weight relating to 100 parts by weight of the epoxy compound in the composition. If the amount of the curing agent therein is smaller than 0.3 parts by weight, the resin composition could not cure sufficiently; on the other hand, if larger than 50 parts by weight, it will adversely affect the properties of the cured product of the resin composition. However, in case where the latent curing agent for epoxy resin of the present invention is used as a cure accelerator for known curing agents, the amount thereof should not be limited to that range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If desired, the epoxy resin composition of the present invention may contain any other known curing agent(s) of, for example, phenolic compounds, acid anhydrides, dicyandiamides, hydrazide compounds, thiol compounds, guanamines or melamines, as well as a cure accelerator(s) of, for example, imidazole compounds or tertiary amines, in addition to the latent curing agent of the invention. Also if desired, the epoxy resin composition may contain any other additives. Examples of such additives are inorganic fillers such as alumina, silica, calcium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, talc, bentonite, barium carbonate, and Aerosil; viscosity adjusters such as acrylic oligomers, silicones; coupling agents such as silane-coupling agents; flame retardants such as phosphates, phosphorus-containing epoxy compounds, and nitrogen-containing phenolic resins; fillers such as nylon particles, polystyrene particles, crosslinked rubber particles, acrylic core/shell particles, rubber-type core/shell particles, silicone particles, and ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer particles; resin modifiers such as carboxyl-terminated, liquid acrylic oligomers; and pigments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preparing an article, said method comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> (1) applying an epoxy resin composition to at least one surface of a substrate; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (2) curing said epoxy resin composition, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> wherein said epoxy resin composition comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (a) an epoxy compound with at least two epoxy groups in the molecule: and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (b) a latent curing agent, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> wherein said latent curing agent comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (A) a radically polymerized polymer of a monomer having at least one polymerizable double bond, which polymer has at least one tertiary amino group in the molecule; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (B) a polymer having at least one hydroxyl group in the molecule, and wherein said latent curing agent is a solid solution that is solid at 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the present method for forming an article, the latent curing agent and the epoxy resin composition are as described above. The substrate may be of any material conventionally bonded or coated with epoxy resin compositions, including metals, such as steel, copper, bronze, gold, silver, platinum, etc., or a plastic, such as polystyrene, polyamide, polyimide, etc. The article may be any article of manufacture which is conventionally prepared by curing an epoxy resin composition, including electronic devices, such as telephone, computers, electronic games, televisions, audio components, etc. The present epoxy resin composition may be applied to the surface of the substrate manually or by machine in an automated process. The optimum amount of epoxy resin applied will, of course depend on the exact nature of the substrate and article. However, the present epoxy resin compositions are generally used in amounts similar to those used for conventional one-part epoxy resin compositions. After application, the epoxy resin composition may be cured by the application of heat. The optimum temperature and time of the curing step will vary with the exact composition of the epoxy resin composition but may be easily determined on a case-by-case basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention is described in more detail with reference to the following Examples, which, however, are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As shown in Table 1, the epoxy resin composition of the present invention has improved low-temperature curability and storage stability than conventional ones. Therefore, when used for adhesives, coating materials, sealants, molding materials and composites, its workability is excellent. In addition, since the resin composition rapidly cures even at such low temperatures of 60&deg; C. to 70&deg; C., it is favorable for bonding structures of low heat resistant materials like plastics to which conventional one-package epoxy resin adhesives are not applicable. Further, the resin composition is applicable even in bonding parts of minute instruments that require high dimensional accuracy and in bonding parts of electronic devices sensitive to heat, to which conventional one-package epoxy resin adhesives are not applicable. Still further, since the resin composition rapidly cures even at low temperatures, the energy for curing such adhesives may be reduced. As stated in the above, the epoxy resin composition that contains the curing agent of the present invention has remarkable industrial advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
