<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Not Applicable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a disposable menstrual undergarment. More specifically, the present invention relates to a disposable menstrual undergarment for wear by young females, or for wear by adults needing special assistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The prior devices for protecting young females who begin menstruation typically include a disposable panty containing thick absorbent materials lining the central portion of the panty along an inner crotch area of the panty. Alternatively, a typical panty for menstrual wear may have an elongated depression along an inner crotch area of the panty for placement of a feminine napkin that is removable by the wearer. Additionally, prior absorbent pants include a menstrual short having a catamenial pad assembly connectable to the crotch area of the menstrual short, with elastic leg openings having a plurality of crimps and/or elastic ridges around each leg opening. For the prior panties, the user must remember to periodically replace the catamenial pad assembly in the crotch area, when the catamenial pad becomes soiled, for continued protection from leakage by the menstrual short. The prior diapers and panties must be properly positioned on the wearer, and must be changed periodically, to provide adequate absorption of menstrual fluid or other excreted fluids. Further, the prior diapers and panties must be periodically inspected by the wearer or a person associated with the wearer, to check for the need of replacement of the absorbent pads or liners. Teachers and/or day-care staff are naturally hesitant to take on the responsibility of reminding young girls of a pre-teen age to periodically check undergarments and/or panties for menstrual releases. Further, pre-teen girls may be shy and hesitant to request permission to visit a rest-room during class sessions in school. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For young females of the ages of 8 to 14 years and who are beginning menstruation, the young females do not normally know in advance when menstrual releases will occur. It is also typical that the young females may not remember to change absorbing pads or feminine napkins at periodic intervals for continuous protection throughout a day in school. Further, young females typically do not prefer wearing a bulky panty under their garments that may be interpreted to be a diaper undergarment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a pull-on panty that is light-weight, stretchable, disposable, and includes at least one removable interior layer. Further, there is a need for a pull-on panty including removable absorbent layers on the crotch interior, and absorbent materials along each leg opening interior, for absorption of fluids to prevent leakage from the panty without the need for periodic replacement of absorbent pads. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a disposable menstrual undergarment for absorption of body fluids including a front portion, a rear portion, and a crotch portion. The undergarment includes an exterior layer of breathable non-porous material, a waistband of generally continuous material, and two leg openings adjacent the crotch portion. Each of the leg openings includes an interior faced absorbent border. The undergarment includes a middle layer of absorbent materials and an interior faced, removable layer of absorbent materials along the interior surfaces of the front portion, rear portion, and the crotch portion of the undergarment. The interior faced, removable layer of absorbent material and the interior faced absorbent border along each interior faced surface of each leg opening provide for absorption of fluids excreted by the wearer of the undergarment. The interior layer of absorbent materials is removable by the wearer from the middle layer when the interior layer is soiled, with the middle layer remaining fixed against the crotch portion and the border of absorbent materials remaining positioned along the interior faced surfaces of each leg opening. The disposable menstrual undergarment provides protection for young females and adults needing special assistance during a day of school or during day-long adult outings, while providing an undergarment that is not bulky, is easily replaceable, and is inexpensive while being fully absorbent of any fluids excreted by the wearer of the undergarment.</paragraph>
