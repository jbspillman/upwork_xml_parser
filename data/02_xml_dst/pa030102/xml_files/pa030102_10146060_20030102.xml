On the front portion of the electric equipment installation chamber is installed the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which comprises buttons <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> used for selecting various functions of the microwave oven and a display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> used for displaying various information signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used for performing sequential display of the selected menus, display of current cooking status, and the like. Further, a control circuit board (not shown), which is used for inputting signals selected through the buttons <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and outputting signals to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is installed at a rear side of the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an operation of controlling the menu display in the conventional microwave oven will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a control section of the conventional microwave oven used for controlling the menu display of the microwave oven. The control section is installed in the control circuit board. As shown in the figure, the control section of the conventional microwave oven comprises a microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for performing various kinds of controls for and operations of the microwave oven, a power circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for supplying power to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and an oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for supplying reference clock pulses used when the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> executes various programs installed in the microcomputer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are stored cooking algorithms for performing the cooking corresponding to various menus of the microwave oven, display algorithms for displaying sequences of the menus of the microwave oven, and various data required for controlling the microwave oven. In particular, display control data used for displaying various menus onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to a sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are stored in the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the conventional microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, the control section of the microwave oven further comprises a key input circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which includes the buttons <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and allows signals to be inputted when a user has selected the buttons <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provided on the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the microwave oven, and the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for notifying the user to confirm contents inputted through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and an operating state of the microwave oven. The display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is the same one as is provided in the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a relay control unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> controls various driven devices (for example, the magnetron, the cooling fan, the heater, an oven lamp, and the like) provided in the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The menu display in the conventional microwave oven constructed as such is carried out through the following operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an operating procedure according to the menu display of the conventional microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> First, when the electric power is supplied to the microwave oven, a predetermined initial screen is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> under the control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, the user selects a predetermined button through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that a main screen, which is used for selecting the menus of the microwave oven and corresponds to a first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When the user has selected a button through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a predetermined signal is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> according to the selected button. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> decodes the inputted signal, and accordingly, causes the predetermined main screen to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. By performing the above processes, the state shown in the first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Next, the user selects a desired cooking menu on the main screen. A &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu selected by the user is highlighted darkly as compared with the other cooking menus so as to inform the user that the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu has been selected in the first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu is selected, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> retrieves submenus of the selected &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu from data stored therein and causes the submenus to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after recognizing that the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu has been selected. A display state at this stage is shown at a second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Then, the user selects another desired cooking menu again on a screen displayed at the second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu selected by the user is highlighted darkly as compared with the other cooking menus so as to inform the user that the &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu has been selected in the second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu is selected, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> retrieves submenus of the selected &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu from data stored therein and causes the submenus to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after recognizing that the &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu has been selected. A display state at this stage is shown at a third stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, if a timer setting screen is displayed as the next stage, the user sets a cooking period of time. If the period setting process has been completed, all the processes related to the menu selection are finished and an information corresponding to the current cooking state is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in a fourth stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the method of controlling the menu display in the conventional microwave oven, when selecting and setting the submenus of the cooking menus of the microwave oven, a previous display screen disappears from the display unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and only a screen corresponding to a currently selected menu is displayed thereon. That is, whenever the user sequentially selects submenus of any arbitrary cooking menus in the microwave oven, a screen for previous selection disappears and only a screen corresponding to a currently selected stage of the menu is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the method of controlling the menu display in the conventional microwave oven, since only a newly and currently selected function or menu is displayed onto the display unit whenever the new function or menu has been selected, the user cannot confirm a previously selected function or menu. Therefore, if the user forgets the previously selected function or menu, there is a problem in that he/she should select the menu again from the beginning, which is cumbersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, if all the buttons for performing the various menus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> should be provided in the control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, there is another problem in that the size and production costs of the control panel are increased and are burdens on the manufactures and consumers since the numerous buttons should be provided therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A process shown in a first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a state of a main screen in the display unit of the microwave oven. The main screen is a first screen for various menus provided in the microwave oven. Thus, the menus corresponding to the highest level are displayed onto the main screen. For example, a &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu, an &ldquo;automatic cooking&rdquo; menu, a &ldquo;defrost&rdquo; menu, and the like are displayed onto the main screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The main screen is predetermined so that it is displayed by selecting any arbitrary buttons in an initial screen displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while the power is supplied to the microwave oven. Thus, when the user has selected any buttons provided on the key input circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so as to select a desired cooking menu, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> recognizes that the state displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is an initial screen state, and allows the predetermined main screen to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, a process shown in a second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a state where the lower menus included in the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu are displayed together with the other menus of the main screen when the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu has been selected in the main screen state. The &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu includes a &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu, a &ldquo;weak operation&rdquo; menu, a &ldquo;grill&rdquo; menu, a &ldquo;deodorization&rdquo; menu and the like as lower functions thereof The menu display is controlled such that when the user wishes to view menus in the main screen which are not displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in such a display state, the menus can be displayed by turning the dial key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further, a process shown in a third stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a state where the &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu has been selected among the lower functions of the &ldquo;manual cooking&rdquo; menu. The &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu is one of the menus corresponding to the lowest functions among all the menus. That is, if the &ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu has been selected, there are no further menu selection processes. Thus, a process of setting a cooking period of time which should be performed subsequently from this state is also displayed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, after the process of setting the cooking period has been completed in the third stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> process of notifying the user to confirm the set period (five minutes and thirty seconds) and the selected cooking menu (&ldquo;strong operation&rdquo; menu) by displaying the period and the cooking menu onto the one screen is then displayed onto the display unit. This process is a state displayed in a fourth stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Finally, a last stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> corresponds to a state where a process of counting down the cooking period is performed as the cooking is actually carried out in the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the processes of displaying the selected menus in the microwave oven according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be explained together with the manipulating processes performed by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating the operating procedure according to the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> First, data are created and stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that a plurality of the menus can be displayed onto the one screen in the form of small display windows whenever the various menus provided in the microwave oven are selected (step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). This process should be performed in advance before shipping the products of the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Then, when the power is supplied to the microwave oven, the predetermined initial screen is retrieved from the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> under the control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the main screen, which is for example shown in the first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and used for selecting the menus of the microwave oven, is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the user has selected a predetermined button. The selection of the button is made through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the button through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a signal corresponding to the selected button is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> decodes the inputted signal, and accordingly, it retrieves the predetermined main screen from the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and allows the main screen to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Through the above process, the state shown in the first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Then, if the user selects a desired menu on the screen displayed in step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the lower functions included in the selected menu are displayed in the form of the tree structure, and the other higher menus are also displayed onto the same screen. That is, it is displayed in the same state as the second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> At this time, it is difficult to display all the menus onto the one screen. The reason is that there is a limitation on a screen size and the number of menus to be displayed is large. Thus, there may be some menus which cannot be displayed onto the current display screen. However, the predetermined dial key can be used so that these menus are displayed onto the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Of course, the signal selected by the user during the process is transmitted to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> decodes the received signal and allows the menu corresponding to the signal to be displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the form of the tree structure. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the menu display in the following manner. That is, if the lower functions are included in the selected menus, they are displayed in the form of the tree structure together with the selected higher menus. Further, in case of unselected menus, only the highest menus or functions thereof are included in the tree structure displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Until a menu the user finally wishes has been selected according to the above process, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> causes the menu selection processes to be sequentially displayed based on the data which are used to control the menu display in the form of the tree structure and stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If the menu selection has been completed according to the processes up to step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a screen used for setting the cooking period of time is displayed onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> together with the finally selected menu, as shown in the third stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). That is, when it has been confirmed that the desired menu has been finally selected during the menu selection process in the form of the tree structure, the screen used for setting the cooking period is displayed together with the selected menu under the control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Further, when the user has inputted the cooking period through the screen provided in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the finally selected menu and the inputted cooking period are displayed onto the same screen so that the user can confirm these matters (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the user confirms the cooking period and the selected menu through step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and selects a button for allowing the microwave oven to be operated (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). An operating signal selected by the user in step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is transmitted to-the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> outputs the operating signal to the relay control unit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the cooking corresponding to the signal inputted by the user can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the cooking to be made in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be started. The cooking to be made in step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is sequentially performed under the control of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during the determined period of time and according to the cooking algorithm corresponding to the selected menu. Further, in order to notify the user that the selected cooking is being performed, the cooking period is displayed while counted down, as shown in the last stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment of the present invention described above, the cooking menus the user has selected and additional lower functions thereof are displayed onto the single display screen of the microwave oven so that the user can easily recognize them at one time. In particular, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the menus of the microwave oven are displayed in the form of the tree structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> That is, only all the higher functions are displayed onto the initial screen of the microwave oven. If any one of the higher functions is selected, all the lower functions included in the selected higher function are displayed. In such a case, the lower functions of the unselected higher functions are not displayed. However, all the higher functions and the lower functions included in the selected higher function are displayed on the one screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At this time, in order to assist the user with his/her easy discrimination of the higher menus, the selected and unselected higher functions are displayed in a state where signs of function indicators thereof are different from one another. For example, the higher function having lower functions is displayed such that a &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; sign is included in its function indicator (rectangular box symbol). Thus, if the higher function with the &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; sign marked in its function indicator is selected, the function indicator of the higher function is displayed as including a &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; sign therein in order to notify the user that the lower functions of the selected higher function are displayed. Further, the higher function which does not include the lower functions may have any empty function indicator (rectangular box symbol) so as to notify the user that the higher function does not include any lower functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Next, processes of controlling the menu display in the microwave oven according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The processes of controlling the menu display in the microwave oven according to a second embodiment of the present invention are to control the display of the selected menus by allowing a plurality of display windows to be displayed onto the same screen. Thus, data stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are controlled such that the various cooking menus provided in the microwave oven can be displayed through a window function. That is, the data stored in the storage device are controlled in such a manner that one of the cooking menus is displayed onto a single screen as one display window on which another cooking menu can be in turn displayed as another display window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a view showing the sequential display states of the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> made when another menu has been selected while the cooking corresponding to any arbitrary menu is in progress, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating the operating procedure relevant thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> If the user selects any menu keys provided for displaying the cooking menus of the microwave oven through the key input circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while the power is being supplied (step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), the signal corresponding to the selected menu is inputted into the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives and recognizes a signal for the cooking selection of the user, and outputs the control signal to the relay control unit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> such that the selected cooking can be performed according to the relevant cooking algorithm stored in the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The relay control unit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> turns on a main relay for operating the magnetron and/or the heater of the microwave oven and a fan motor relay for operating the fan motor according to the control signal of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the cooking menu selected by the user will be performed in the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the display of a notification signal for notifying the user of the currently performed cooking onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). The display at this time is made by using only one display window. Further, information displayed in the display window (a first display state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is stored in a recordable region of the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If any other cooking menus are not selected until the cooking according to the menu selected in step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is completed after the procedure has proceeded up to step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the display state of step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is maintained onto the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> However, if other additional functions are selected before the selected cooking is completed after the procedure has proceeded up to step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (steps <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>), the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> causes the display window of a first stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to be displayed as a background screen (step <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>). Then, another display window corresponding to the selected additional function is also displayed onto the background screen. The display state at this time is shown in a second stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The menu corresponding to the additional function selected in step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is limited to a menu which does not interfere with the currently performed cooking selected in step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. For example, the additional function includes hood fan operation, lamp operation, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If another display window for the additional function is displayed onto the background screen in step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and an operation setting needed for performing the additional function is completed, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stores the display window for the additional function set in step <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> into the storage device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the user confirms the screen in which the additional function setting is completed, as shown in a third stage of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). If the additional function setting is completed, the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is returned to the initial background screen (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). Of course, information that the operation according to the additional function is in progress is also displayed onto the background screen returned in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the present invention described above, the background screen for displaying the main functions of the microwave oven is created onto the display screen and then is stored. Further, the small display windows for displaying the additional functions of the microwave oven are created and displayed onto the background screen used for showing the main functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> That is, when operating auxiliary parts such as fan, lamp and timer in a state where the main function of the microwave oven, i.e. cooking function, is being performed, the window function is implemented into the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the user can easily set, confirm and recognize the additional functions even during the operation of the main function. Thus, the user can confirm the operating state of the microwave oven on one screen at one time and recognize that he/she has selected the additional functions such as the operations of the timer and fan of the microwave oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Although the display state of the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been described as an operating relationship between the main and additional functions, the present invention is not limited thereto. The feature of the present invention is that the display state of the display unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be expressed through a plurality of display windows. Further, the present invention is characterized in that the plurality of display windows are controlled to be displayed onto only one screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the device and method for controlling the menu display of the microwave oven of the present invention, the additional display windows used for setting the other additional functions can be formed in a state where the display window for the arbitrary menu appears on the display unit. Thus, numerous menus can be displayed onto only one screen. Accordingly, since the main display window and the additional display windows can be displayed onto the background screen, there is an advantage in that the user can certainly recognize that the additional functions are being set during the process of the main function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the other embodiment of the present invention, the cooking menus selected by the user and the other various menus are displayed on the same display screen in the form of the tree structure, so that the user can recognize a plurality of the menus of the microwave oven at one time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention having the above menu display control, since the user can confirm the various functions of the microwave oven on the same screen at one time, there is another advantage in that trials and errors made when using the microwave oven can be minimized. In addition, since all the functions can be confirmed simultaneously, there are further advantages in that the time required for learning how to use the microwave oven is reduced and function selection can be conveniently made. </paragraph>
