<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention is in the art of synthetic lubricants based on esters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is a concern over the biodegradability and other eco-toxicity properties of lubricants used in environmentally sensitive applications such as forestry, mining, and agriculture. Equipment manufacturers who use these lubricants have observed that product performance declines when so-called &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo; based fluids are used. In addition to the environmentally friendly qualities such as biodegradability, recent regulatory initiatives are directed to using fluids derived from renewable resources (e.g., from agricultural products). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> TMP oleate (trimethylolpropane trioleate) is considered the industry standard in formulating biodegradable hydraulic fluids. It has the appropriate viscosity (circa 46 cst at 40&deg; C.) and biodegradability. However, TMP oleate has poor oxidative and thermal stability, and poor low temperature fluidity (e.g., pour point). An effective replacement for TMP oleate has heretofore been unavailable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,863; 5,681,800; 5,728,658; 5,767,047; and 5,817,607 are directed to biodegradable lubricants comprising, inter alia, esters derived from branched acids. These acids are based on propylene oligomers, which are not considered renewable natural products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently French Patent Application 2,763,597 (A1) described a lubricating oil composition for using industrial materials used in the preparation of products intended for living biological organisms, e.g., food preparation. The reference does not address lubricating oils having the appropriate properties to replace TMP oleate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a fluid having the appropriate technical properties required by a lubricant while at the same time having environmentally friendly properties and being derived from renewable resources. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present inventor has found that esters prepared by esterifying linear acids with alcohols, wherein both the acids and alcohols are derived from natural products, provide lubricants having good biodegradability and eco-toxicity requirements, as well as technical requirements that are similar to or even superior to lubricants currently used by equipment manufacturers. In particular, an ester made by reacting sorbitol with 3-6 molar equivalents of a mixture of at least two different fatty acids provides a lubricant equal to or superior to TMP oleate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Sorbitol can be derived from natural products such as corn oil (hydrogenation of glucose) and certain linear fatty acids are derived from natural products such as coconut oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as reference is made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, specific examples, and the attached claims. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A polyol derived from natural sources, preferably sorbitol, is partially or fully esterified with at least two different linear acids derived from natural sources (e.g., renewable), preferably two or more different fatty acids, each independently having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, still more preferably two different linear fatty acids selected from C6, C8, C10, and C12 fatty acids. It is preferred that sorbitol is esterified with 3-6 molar equivalents of the mixed fatty acids. As used herein the term &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; means at least two fatty acids having different carbon number. Three or more different fatty acids may also be used. Examples of suitable acids include, but are not limited to, caprylic acid, capric acid, and lauric acid.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A sorbitol ester fluid was made by refluxing 1.25 moles of sorbitol with 5.5 moles of a commercially available 60:40 wt % mixture of caprylic acid/capric acid (C8 and C10, respectively) at 240&deg; C. The reaction proceeded until the hydroxyl number was less than 3. The hydroxyl number can be determined by one of skill in the art. Unreacted acids were removed by vacuum distillation. A further reduction in acidity was obtained by neutralizing the free acid with Ca(OH)2 until the total acid number (TAN), as determined by ASTM D974, was less than 0.1. The properties of this ester fluid are compared with TMP oleate in Table 1, below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in the table above, the stability of the oil based on the sorbitol ester fluid is superior to the oil based on the oleate ester. This is shown in the dry TOST test (Modified ASTM D943) and the oxidation and corrosion test. The TOST test is modified from the published method D943 in that no water is included in the test. The oxidation and corrosion test is according to FTM 5308, modified in that only copper, aluminum, and steel are used as metal specimens. The TOST life is reported in hours to achieve a TAN of greater than 2. The oil based on TMP oleate lasted 332 hours while the oil based on the sorbitol ester lasted more than 1000 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the oxidation and corrosion test, an oil sample is held for 72 hours at 175&deg; C. in the presence of copper, steel, and aluminum specimen. Air is sparged through the sample at a rate of 5 liter/hr. The change in TAN and viscosity are reported at the completion of the test. The viscosity increase of the oleate ester was about 35 time higher than the sorbitol ester, and the TAN increase was about 4 times higher. These performance features are useful to prolong the service life of ester based hydraulic fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The demulsibility test is run according to ASTM D1401. 40 mls of oil and 40 mls of water are mixed in a graduated cylinder and held at 180&deg; F. The amount of time for the oil and water to separate is recorded. The sorbitol ester separated water faster than the TMP oleate, which is beneficial in wet hydraulic systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Foaming is measured by ASTM D892. Air is blown through a porous stone into a cylinder of oil. The volume of foam produced and the time required for the foam to collapse is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an hydraulic oil formulated using an ester lubricant based on polyols and fatty acids derived from natural products, preferably an ester derived by esterifying sorbitol with a mixture of at least two linear fatty acids, even more preferably wherein the at least two linear acids are independently selected from acids having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and most preferably wherein the acids mixture comprises caprylic acid &lsqb;CH3(CH2)6COOH&rsqb; and capric acid &lsqb;CH3(CH2)8COOH&rsqb;. The polyol, most preferably sorbitol, can be esterified using at least 3 molar equivalents of total acids in the linear fatty acid mixture, preferably at least 4 molar equivalents of total acids in the linear fatty acid mixture, and more preferably at least 5 molar equivalents of total acids in the linear fatty acid mixture (equivalents based on the number of hydroxyl groups in the polyol). It can be esterified using less than 4 molar equivalents of mixed linear fatty acids (i.e., less than four alcohol groups esterified) or more than 4 molar equivalents, up to fully esterified. The hydraulic oil according to the present invention is preferably used in environmentally sensitive applications such as forestry, mining, and agriculture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described above with particular attention to the most preferred embodiments, but it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure that many variations and modifications of the aforementioned may be practiced within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Those particular preferred embodiments include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A lubricant formulation having an ester as the base material, the improvement comprising making said ester by reacting sorbitol with 3 to 6 molar equivalents of mixed linear fatty acids; or more preferably wherein said mixed linear fatty acids are selected from C6 to C12 acids; or even more preferably wherein said mixed linear fatty acids are selected from C6, C8, C10, and C12 acids; or still more preferably wherein said mixed linear fatty acids are caprylic and capric acids; yet still more preferably wherein said base material is made by reacting sorbitol with a 60:40 wt % mixture of caprylic and capric acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An hydraulic fluid for equipment used in forestry, mining, or agricultural operations comprising a base stock consisting essentially of an ester derived from natural products; more preferably wherein said ester is made esterifying at least one linear acid derived from corn with linear alcohols derived from coconut oil. </paragraph>
