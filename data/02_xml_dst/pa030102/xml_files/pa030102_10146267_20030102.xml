<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of semiconductor fabrication, and more particularly to semiconductor device separation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Sapphire wafers are an important semiconductor substrate. They are especially important for the development of gallium nitride based materials technology, which is used in blue spectrum light emitting diodes (LEDs). The production of high brightness LEDs in the blue spectrum is a relatively recent optoelectronics technology. The demand for nitride based LEDs, such as bright blue, bright green and other color LEDs, currently exceeds the industry&apos;s capability to supply them. Sapphire based device separation, however, remains a significant obstacle to efficient fabrication. Current separation techniques waste valuable wafer surface area, involve costly consumables, and have long process times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor fabrication processes involve fabricating several thousand individual devices, or die, on one wafer. After processing and testing, the wafer may be thinned and the die must be separated from the wafer. Separation has been traditionally accomplished using either a dicing saw or a scribe-and-break process, both of which rely on diamond chips to cut the material. These two processes have been very effective on silicon and III-V substrates, because the material is much softer than diamond. However, sapphire&apos;s crystal structure, crystal orientation, inherent hardness, and material strength inhibit these methods from working well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the diamond&apos;s edge dulls quickly when applied to sapphire. To compensate, dicing saw blades designed to cut sapphire contain diamonds in a resin matrix. The dicing blades wear quickly to constantly expose new, sharp diamonds. Although processing times and the number of blades is dependent on die size, studies have shown that completely dicing a 17 mil thick sapphire substrate into 16 mil&times;<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mil die would require up to four blades and over 2 hours of process time and the maximum yield would be 25%. A 4 mil thick sapphire substrate completely shatters during dicing. These low yields make it difficult to meet commercial demand. The yields are low because the minimum blade thickness is 8 mil. This results in a kerf width of &gt;0.010&Prime;. Thinner blades, however, produce poor quality cuts. A significant amount of available device surface area is therefore wasted during wafer sawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The scribe-and-break separation process also relies on a sharp diamond edge or facet. The scribe tip has a diamond head which is quickly dulled by the sapphire. This requires frequent and costly tip replacement. Due to these factors, a sapphire dicing process will produce too low a yield. Moreover, both the sawing and diamond scribing process become very complex due to diamond wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another method for device separation is discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,151,389 and 5,214,261, both of which are issued to Zapella. These references discuss a method for dicing semiconductor substrates using an excimer laser beam. This method uses a laser beam that is oriented out of normal with respect to the substrate to ensure non-tapered cuts. A drawback of this method is that the substrate and the laser beams must be maintained within the critical out of normal ranges. A further drawback is that a polyimide coating is used to prevent &ldquo;dust&rdquo; from settling onto the surface. The removal of this coating via chemical peeling introduces the possibility of contamination. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method for efficient and inexpensive separation of semiconductor wafers by laser ablation. The method uses a laser to ablate material from the substrate, resulting in a separated wafer. Laser separation is advantageous because it permits processing of any sapphire based product, such as blue LEDs, inexpensively and quickly. Importantly, the separation methods are applicable to gallium arsenide (GaAs) and to other semiconductors with the same potential benefits of high throughputs, narrow kerfs and no cutting tips to wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment, the method of the present invention separates semiconductor wafers into a plurality of devices via laser ablation. A laser light emission is generated and sent through optical elements and masks to obtain a patterned laser projection. The patterned laser projection is then directed toward a given surface of a semiconductor wafer such that the patterned laser projection is substantially perpendicular to the given surface. The patterned laser projection is applied for a specified time at a specified power to obtain at least a partial cut through the semiconductor wafer. If the wafers are not fully cut using the laser, a mechanical method is then applied to complete the separation and create the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the pattern of the laser projection can be selected in view of the type of semiconductor wafer. For example, the patterned laser projection of the present invention can be one long, narrow line that cuts several millimeters with one pulse or several smaller lines that cut several rows simultaneously with one pulse. Moreover, a protective layer is applied to the cutting surface to prevent cutting process effluent from contaminating the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention results in a kerf in the order of 10 &mgr;m wide if cut from a front surface and less than 10 &mgr;m if cut from a back or substrate surface. Consequently, the present invention reduces wastage of wafer space and permits more devices to be placed on the wafer. The above factors make the present invention an efficient, low maintenance and high production method for separating semiconductor wafers. Such a method is a significant step toward meeting the demand for sapphire based devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, a cleaning system is used during ablation to draw up particles and smoke to improve the ablation process and reduce post ablation cleaning of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a reflector is applied to a wafer surface opposite the laser emission to reflect laser light back onto the wafer thereby making more efficient use of the laser emission.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The following description is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For purposes of clarity, a top-level functional overview of the present invention is presented, followed by an exemplary embodiment of a laser-based semiconductor separation system incorporating the methodology of the present invention. A more detailed explanation of the methodology is then presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In general, the method of the present invention separates a semiconductor wafer into several thousand devices or die by laser ablation. Semiconductor wafers are initially pre-processed to create multiple devices, such as blue LEDs, on the wafers. The wafers are then mounted with tape coated with a generally high level adhesive. The mounted wafer is then placed on a vacuum chuck (which is itself positioned on a computer controlled positioning table) to hold it in place during the cutting process. The cutting surface is then covered with a protective layer to prevent contamination from the effluent resulting from the actual cutting process. A laser light emission is generated and passed through optical elements and masks to create a pattern, such as a line or multiple lines. The patterned laser projection is directed at the wafer at a substantially normal angle and applied to the wafer until at least a partial cut is achieved through it. A mechanical separation process completes the separation when only a partial cut is achieved by the patterned laser projection. The die are then transferred to a grip ring for further processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an exemplary embodiment of a laser-based separation system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that can be used in conjunction with the method of the present invention to separate a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a laser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> coupled to a computer control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a projection delivery system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is any laser that has the necessary parameters, for example, power, wavelength and frequency, to cut semiconductor wafers, such as but not limited to KrF lasers, Nd:YAG lasers, and other lasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, projection delivery system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> uses optical elements and masks to shape the laser light emission into a pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that will optimize the cutting process on semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The optimal pattern may be either one long, narrow line that will cut several millimeters of the surface up to 100 &mgr;m deep with each pulse, or several smaller lines that will cut several rows simultaneously with each pulse. Other patterns, such as a grid pattern can also be used. The optimal configuration depends on the type of semiconductor wafer being separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is situated on a vacuum chuck <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to hold semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in place during the cutting process. Moreover, as explained below, vacuum chuck <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> flattens the shape of semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> during the cutting process. Vacuum chuck <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is situated on a xyz theta positioning table <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Computer control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> controls the movement of xyz theta positioning table <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with respect to patterned light projection <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> so as to place the cuts in the correct areas. As the name of the table implies, computer control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> moves semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the x, y and z axes and rotates it a given &thgr;. This, along with video monitor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> provides accurate control and placement of where patterned light projection <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> will cut semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Given the above laser-based semiconductor separation system, a more detailed explanation of the method of the present invention is presented. This explanation is given with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which shows a cross-sectional view of a processed semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which illustrates graphically some of the steps in the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the following description primarily refers to cutting gallium nitride (GaN) on C-plane sapphire, these are only illustrative materials. The epitaxial growth material can be, for example, any semiconductor material such as any of the III-V materials listed in the periodic chart of elements. The substrate material can be, for example, any of the III-V materials, refractory ceramics and any orientations of any of the listed substrate materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a front surface <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, which is also referred to as the epi or epitaxial surface, and a back surface <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which is also referred to as the substrate surface. Prior to cutting, GaN layer <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> will have been etched and coated with three metal patterns <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and a dielectric <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Sapphire substrate <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may be thinned from 0.017&Prime; to 0.004&Prime;. The processing creates approximately 11000 devices on a 2&Prime; diameter wafer. Due to lattice mismatch in the GaN/sapphire structure, the resulting stress in the structure causes the wafer to &ldquo;bow&rdquo;, such that it resembles a potato chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The bow in the wafer is flattened by a process termed wafer mounting. The wafer mounting process is also required to keep the 11000 individual devices in order. In an exemplary embodiment, wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is mounted on 0.003&Prime; to 0.005&Prime; thick tape <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> coated with a generally high tack adhesive. The mounting process is outlined below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 1. Place wafer on mounting station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 2. Center dicing ring (which is a 9&Prime; outer diameter, 8&Prime; inner diameter and 0.10&Prime; thick metal ring) around wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 3. Place a sheet of tape over wafer and ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 4. Press tape onto ring and wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 5. Place a sheet of wax paper over the mounting structure (the adhesive side of the tape, wafer, and ring). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 6. Cut out the center of the wax paper so the wafer is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> 7. Place mounting structure, wafer side up, on a vacuum chuck, which holds the structure in place and removes the wafer&apos;s bow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Note that the vacuum chuck can either be porous ceramic or contain concentric metal rings. The latter may require a backing so the ring pattern is not pressed into the tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Because mounting tape <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is used, the parameters of the patterned laser projection are set in one embodiment of the method to achieve only a partial cut through the device. A mechanical breaking process is used to complete the separation. If a full or total cut through the wafer is desired, another layer must adhered on to the bottom of the mounting tape. This layer, for example, could be an epoxy or double sided tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Prior to the wafer mounting process, however, the user must decide which surface of the wafer to cut on. Whether to cut on the front surface or the back may depend upon the cut width or kerf that is produced for the particular type of wafer being cut. To minimize wafer wastage, the kerf value should be on the order of 10 &mgr;m wide. For example, front and back surface cuts should have kerf values of less than 100 &mgr;m. For the illustrative GaN/sapphire structure, the kerf value is about 20 &mgr;m when cutting from the front surface and less than 10 &mgr;m when cutting from the back surface. However, there are additional considerations that must be accounted for before deciding on which surface to cut on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to Table 1, although cutting from the back surface results in a low kerf value, the resulting device edges are rough. This may decrease the performance of the device. With regard to blue LEDs, this means that the light output may be decreased. In contrast, the device edges are cleaner when cutting from the front surface. Consequently, this can increase the light output for the blue LEDs.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once the cutting surface has been selected, a protective layer must be placed on it. Studies have shown that the cutting process coats the wafer&apos;s surface with effluent, which is unacceptable. Generally, the wafer&apos;s surface is protected with either photoresist or polyimide during a laser separation process, and the coating is removed with a solvent after the process. This is not possible in the present case because the solvent may damage mounting tape <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The contamination problem is overcome by covering the cutting surface with a generally lower tack mounting tape <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. This provides excellent protection from effluent. Two pieces of tape were used for each wafer-one for X direction cutting and one for Y direction cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Once the wafer is mounted and taped, it is placed on positioning table <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, for example, a KrF laser operating at 248 nm or a Nd:YAG operating at 1064 nm, is activated to generate laser light emission operable to cut the semiconductor wafer. The laser light emissions are fed through projection delivery system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to produce a pattern. The patterned light projection is then directed toward a selected cutting surface of the wafer so that it is substantially normal to the cutting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The parameters of the laser, such as cutting speed, laser power, laser pulse rate, number of cuts, cut depth, etc., are set to achieve the required cut without inducing cracking and chipping. Studies using several types of laser sources have indicated that multiple shallow cuts, for example, cut depths of one mil to three mils for a 13 mil thick wafer, are required to separate sapphire based substrates without cracking. In contrast, deep cuts, for example, a 6 mil deep cut, caused cracks in the wafer. Studies have also shown that cut depths of 45 &mgr;m leave very little effluent on the surface. As stated above, this is a very important consideration in terms of contamination of the separated devices. In addition, the parameters are also set to achieve the desired partial or full cut through the wafer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, cuts <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are made through oxide layers <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> graphical representation <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of how a wafer is cut is shown. Starting with a mounted uncut wafer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), tape <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is placed on the cutting surface of wafer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Taped wafer <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is cut in the X direction (step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the excess tape is removed (step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). X cut wafer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is again covered with tape <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and is now cut in the Y direction (step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The excess tape is removed, leaving at least a partially cut wafer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the above method separates the entire wafer into square die. In an exemplary cut, the cuts are on 400 &mgr;m centers, in the X and Y directions. The cut depths are roughly 85 &mgr;m. The remaining 15 &mgr;m is mechanically broken using conventional techniques. A single laser cut die <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and a plurality of die <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As indicated, the actual die size is 372 &mgr;m with a kerf width of 28 &mgr;m. Moreover, these photos show that the edges resulting from the laser cuts are sharp. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an example of a laser cut in GaN that has a kerf width of 20 &mgr;m and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a scanning electron microscope photo of characteristic features of a laser cut surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After cutting, the wax paper is removed and the cut quality is inspected. The next steps depend on the wafer&apos;s orientation during cutting. If the wafer was mounted with the GaN surface on the mounting tape and cut from the back surface, the individual die must be remounted on tape with the GaN surface facing up. That is done using the following process: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> 1. Cover the mounting tape with clean wax paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 2. Cut a hole in the wax paper to expose the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> 3. Cover the wafer, wax paper, and the ring with a tape that has higher adhesion than the tape on which the wafer was cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> 4. Wait until the adhesive strength of the new tape maximizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> 5. Peel off the tape on which the wafer was cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> 6. Transfer the wafer to a grip ring using commercial equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If the wafer was cut from the GaN surface and the mounting tape was not damaged, then the wafer and the tape on which it was cut is transferred to a grip ring. If the mounting tape was damaged, then two tape transfers are necessary. The first would place the die, GaN surface down, on a medium tack tape, and the second would place the die, GaN surface up, on a high tack tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there has been described a method for separating a semiconductor wafer using a patterned laser projection. The patterned laser is incident substantially normal to a cutting surface of the wafer. The parameters of the laser system are set to maximize throughput without inducing damage to the wafer. The wafer itself is protected from cutting process effluent by the placement of a generally low tack adhesive tape on the cutting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment as shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> projection delivery system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> uses optical element and masks to shape the laser emission into a linear pattern <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. A gas jet nozzle <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and vacuum hose <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> are arranged in alignment with the linear pattern from the projection delivery system. The jet nozzle projects an inert gas, identified by lines <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, across the length of the path of the linear pattern. The gas is maintained at a level of 2 psi, which is of sufficient force to move particles into the mouth of the vacuum hose. Presently, nitrogen gas is preferred as it is relatively inexpensive, poses no health risks, and does not interfere with the ablation process. However, it will be appreciated that any inert gas may be used including, but limited to, helium, argon, krypton, and neon. The jets help to remove particles and smoke encountered during the laser ablation process, thereby reducing the cleaning conducted after separation. Additionally, the laser ablation process is improved due to removal of particles that would otherwise interfere and reduce the efficiency of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of the semiconductor wafer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is illustrated where like reference numerals refer to like structures. The wafer includes a layer of reflective metal <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> applied to the substrate side of the wafer. Any reflective metal may be chosen; however, the metal selected preferably has reflection properties that are greatest for the wavelength of the light that is generated in the LED. A metal of the type suitable for this purpose is aluminum. The layer thickness is preferably within the range of 0-0.5 &mgr;m with a workable range of 0-1 &mgr;m. The tape <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is applied to the reflective metal. The laser is applied from the side opposite the metal layer and as the laser is directed into the wafer laser light is reflected back from the reflective layer allowing for enhanced laser cutting efficiency on the epitaxial. Ablation occurs at the point where the energy density of the laser exceeds the energy density threshold for the material being ablated. The relatively transparent nature of the sapphire at the wavelength of the laser allows for laser energy to be reflected off of the metal layer and back towards the ablation point thereby increasing the energy density and improving the efficiency of the cutting process. The reflective metal is useful not only for wafer separation, but the material provides a reflective backing to the LED to direct more of the light out of the LED, thereby improving its output efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention. Details of the structure may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention and the exclusive use of all modifications which come within the scope of the appended claims are reserved. </paragraph>
