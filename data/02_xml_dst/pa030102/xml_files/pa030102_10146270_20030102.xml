<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to confectionery compositions such as breath mints, low boiled candy, hard boiled candy, coated candy, lozenges, oral pasta, pressed mints, throat drops and the like, that comprise polyphosphate with an average anion chain length of greater than or equal to 4 and wherein the confectionery composition comprises less than 10%, by weight of the composition, water and less than 2%, by weight of the composition, elastomer. Preferably this invention relates to non-cariogenic or so called &ldquo;sugar free&rdquo; confectionery compositions. More particularly this invention relates to compositions that have anti-calculus and surface conditioning effects in the oral cavity. Compositions of the present invention are suitable for use by humans or animals. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Dental plaque is the name given to a deposit of material that accumulates on the teeth and adjacent surfaces of the oral cavity. It is the product of microbial growth in the oral cavity, primarily derived from the food/sugar residues in the mouth. Mucoproteins, minerals and food deposits present in the saliva, and dead cells in the mouth, also contribute to the formation of plaque. The build up of plaque enhances the formation of calculus, a hard mineral material that deposits on teeth. Calculus is formed when calcium phosphate crystals, which become entangled in the plaque film, become sufficiently closely packed together to aggregate and become resistant to deformation. The build up of both plaque and calculus on the teeth leads to a general decline in oral health resulting in an increase in the rate of formation of dental caries, an increase in the prevalence of gum disease and can also contribute to the staining of teeth and the presence of malodour. If left untreated these conditions can lead to severe oral disease and deterioration of the gums and teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Several anti-plaque and anti-calculus agents are known in the art. One such material is linear or cyclic dehydrated polyphosphate, which is known to be an effective calcium/magnesium ion suppressor, a sequestrant and/or chelating agent and an effective inhibitor of calculus formation. Well-known examples are the water soluble hexametaphosphates, tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphates and the like. These materials have been widely disclosed in oral care compositions such as dentifrice. Examples of such disclosures include U.S. Pat. No. 5,094,844 which discloses oral compositions comprising tripolyphosphate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,460,565 which discloses oral compositions comprising two or more fluoride compounds and an agent capable of supplying calcium ions to the teeth optionally in conjunction with a cyclic phosphate; WO 99/12517 which discloses oral compositions comprising tripolyphosphate, pyrophosphate and PVP; JP 10-182388 which discloses compositions comprising cyclic and linear condensed phosphoric acid and curry extract and JP 9-295942 which discloses an agent for preventing tooth decay comprising at least 1 meta phosphate. Such polyphosphates are also known to provide a buffering effect within oral compositions comprising zinc (U.S. Pat. No. 4,170,632 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,170,633 both to Wagenknecht). In addition, the pending patent application PCT/US00/30808 reports that long chain linear polyphosphates with an average anion chain length of greater than or equal to 4 provide novel surface conditioning benefits to the teeth and mucosa. This leads to an improved cleaning impression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, one of the commonly known issues with polyphosphates, especially long chain polyphosphates, is that they are rapidly hydrolysed and therefore their efficacy is reduced over time. Furthermore, when the polyphosphate is introduced into the oral cavity, salivary enzymes quickly hydrolyse the material, again leading to a reduction in desired efficacy. The prior art suggests that this can be prevented by use of the polyphosphate in combination with fluoride and polyvarboxylate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,977 and EP 333,301). However, this provides several formulation limitations, both regarding the type of polyphosphate that can be used and in controlling the relative ratio of the polyphosphate to other ingredients. As such there are several opportunities to further optimise the formulation of oral care products comprising polyphosphate to overcome these hydrolysis issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is currently a movement in the oral care industry to encourage consumers to use dental hygiene products throughout the day and to brush their teeth more often. However, this is at best inconvenient and is often not possible. As such significant developmental effort has been focused towards developing oral care products in forms which are portable, which can be used several times a day, particularly after eating and which provide anti-plaque and anti-calculus benefits comparable to those obtained by regular brushing with dentifrice. It is hoped that such a product will improve the oral hygiene of consumers. In addition, such a product would make it easier to provide good oral hygiene to children and pets where it is not always easy to regularly brush the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Confectionery compositions which are popular with both children and adults alike and which are retained in the oral cavity for substantial periods of time during consumption, would seem to make an ideal product form for a portable oral care product. The art of the development and manufacture of a wide range of confectionery compositions is well known. However, the high sugar content of such confectionery compositions has been recognised as a contributory factor in poor dental health. Developments have been made to produce &ldquo;sugar free&rdquo;, or non-cariogenic, confectionery which retain their organoleptic properties but which do not contribute to the formation of dental plaque. More recently research has turned to developing confectionery compositions, particularly &ldquo;sugar free&rdquo; confectionery compositions, particularly chewing gum compositions, which comprise one or more oral care agents. One such example is WO 99/44436, which discloses coated chewing gum compositions which comprise materials with known oral care benefits. However, although chewing gum products have several advantages, they also have several disadvantages in that the chewing of gum is considered unsightly by some consumers and is not acceptable in certain societies. In addition, the chewing gum product format is not ideal for administering to pets and children. As such there is a need for a confectionery oral care product form, or range of forms, which are acceptable in a wide range of societies but which maintain high degrees of oral care efficacy, particularly anti-plaque and anti-calculus efficacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of polyphosphate in confectionery compositions has been reported in the art. Examples include EP 309,414 which discloses chewing gum compositions comprising gum base and an anti-calculus active selected from polyphosphate, citrates and malates; U.S. Pat. No. 4,908,211 which discloses chewing gum comprising a sanguinarine and optionally a polypyrophosphate; U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,687 which discloses chewing gum compositions optionally comprising pyrophosphate or polyphosphate compositions; pending patent application PCT/US00/17177 which discloses chewing gum compositions comprising polyphosphate and U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,270 which discloses chewing gum compositions optionally comprising tripolyphosphate. Whilst the teaching of the prior art provide useful teachings as to the development of chewing gum compositions comprising short chain polyphosphates they do not teach how to develop a wide range of non chewing gum confectionery compositions comprising polyphosphate. Nor do they teach how to formulate such compositions with excellent anti-calculus benefits. Finally the prior art does not teach how to stabilise long chain polyphosphates in the formulation such that the anti-calculus benefits are retained over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Low levels of polyphosphates are also known in the confectionery art for their ability to stabilise whippable emulsion systems. Examples include U.S. Pat. No. 4,120,987 which discloses aerated confectionery comprising water soluble protein hydrosylates, starches and phosphate salts; EP 7504 which discloses a whippable composition comprising whey protein, wheat protein, gelatine and polyphosphates; JP 8-242771 which discloses confectionery compositions comprising whey protein and optionally sodium polyphosphate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,777 which discloses oil in water emulsions comprising oil, fat, proteins, emulsifier, amino acid, sugars and optionally sodium hexametaphosphate; U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,519 which discloses a flavoured syrup comprising a sweetener, water and a sequestrant which is optionally polyphosphate; WO 00/13521 which discloses chewable protein based pet toys comprising protein, water, flavour, plasticiser, nutrients and which optionally comprise polyphosphates; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5618,518 which discloses pet chews soaked in sodium hexametaphosphate solution; and JP 9-4069342 which discloses Japanese style sweets comprising soybean beta amylase, emulsifier and polymerised phosphate. Although the prior art provides useful teachings as to how to use low levels of polyphosphate salts to stabilise emulsion systems it does not teach how to prepare a wide range of stable confectionery compositions with anti-calculus efficacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, it has now been found that, when a confectionery composition is prepared comprising greater than 1% of a polyphosphate material with an average anion chain length of greater than or equal to 4, less than 10% water and a carrier material which comprises less than 2% elastomer, a stable, portable oral care composition is obtained with beneficial anti-calculus efficacy comparable to frequent brushing. In addition it has been found that such confectionery compositions provide surface conditioning effects resulting in a remarkable cleaning impression and positive mouth feel characteristics both during and following use. This reinforces the anti-calculus consumer benefit. Furthermore, by formulating the product in a wide range of confectionery forms, consumer acceptable portable oral care, which is easily administered to adults, children and pets, has been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that when a confectionery composition is formulated comprising greater than 1% polyphosphate material with an average anion chain length of greater than or equal to four, the composition has an enhanced anti-calculus benefit vs that of shorter chain length polyphosphates. Furthermore, by ensuring that the confectionery composition comprises less than 10% water the polyphosphate remains stably formulated during storage thus retaining its anti-calculus efficacy. Adding the polyphosphate as a dry material further enhances this effect. This is because, due to the low level of water in the composition, the dry material does not become solubilised and thus cannot hydrolyse. Furthermore it is believed that the longer chain polyphosphate is hydrolysed more slowly in the oral cavity. This also results in enhanced anti-calculus benefit. In addition the long chain polyphosphates modify the surface hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the mucosal and tooth surfaces, which result in the surface conditioning effect experienced by the user. It has also been surprisingly found that the polyphosphate can help to reduce the astringency of a metallic ion. Additionally, this reduction in astringency can occur without significantly reducing the efficacy of the polyphosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide portable oral care product, suitable for use by adults, children and pets, with excellent anti-calculus efficacy. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a confectionery composition that provides improved intra-oral cleaning impression and smooth tooth surface impression to reinforce the oral care benefit. It is another object of the present invention to provide confectionery compositions comprising polyphosphate material with an average anion chain length of greater than or equal to four, and/or orally active metallic ions with reduced astringency. These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent from the detailed description that follows. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the specification concludes with claims, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> All documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Herein, &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms &ldquo;consisting of&rdquo; and &ldquo;consisting essentially of&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight of the total composition and all measurements made are at 25&deg; C., unless otherwise designated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;safe and effective amount&rdquo; as used herein means an amount of a compound, component, or composition sufficient to significantly induce a positive benefit, but low enough to avoid serious side effects, i.e. to provide a reasonable benefit to risk ratio, within the scope of sound medical judgement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;orally active&rdquo; as used herein means a material that provides either a cosmetic, prophylactic or therapeutic benefit within the oral cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;confectionery&rdquo; as defined herein means a solid, gum-like, or glassy composition optionally having a liquid centre filling and/or optionally coated which comprises greater than about 25% sugar or sugar alcohol. Such compositions usually have a sweet taste. Examples of confectionery products include, but are not limited to, breath mints, low boiled candy, hard boiled candy, coated candy, lozenges, oral pasta, pressed mints, throat drops and the like. As defined herein the term confectionery does not comprise chewing gum. </paragraph>

It is preferred that the compositions have a texture of granulated sugar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;surface conditioning&rdquo; as defined herein means creating a hydrophilic tooth surface immediately after treatment; and maintaining these effects for extended periods of time after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Active and other ingredients useful herein may be categorised or described herein by their cosmetic and/or therapeutic benefit or their postulated mode of action. However, it is to be understood that the active and other ingredients useful herein can in some instances provide more than one therapeutic and/or cosmetic benefit or operate via more than one mode of action. Therefore, classifications herein are made for the sake of convenience and are not intended to limit an ingredient to the particularly stated application or applications listed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The elements of the compositions and methods of the present invention are described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Polyphosphate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention comprise greater than about 1%, preferably from about 1.5% to about 50%, more preferably from about 2% to about 15%, even more preferably from about 3% to about 12%, and most preferably from about 5% to about 10%, by weight, of polyphosphate salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Polyphosphate is a widely used term, which relates to phosphate anions which have been polymerised by dehydration to form a polymer of the phosphate anion. The polyphosphates can exist as linear or cyclic materials or mixtures thereof. It is preferred that the polyphosphates are linear materials comprising only low levels of cyclic materials. Polyphosphates are also characterised by the average anion chain length of the polymer anion. For the purposes of this invention the polyphosphates referred to are those with an average anion chain length of 4 or greater. It is preferred that the polyphosphates have an average anion chain length of from about 6 to about 40, preferably of from about 10 to about 30; more preferably of from about 14 to about 25 and even more preferably of from about 18 to about 25, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore polyphosphates exist as salts. It is preferred that the polyphosphate is an alkali metal salt, ammonium salt or mixtures thereof, preferably a sodium or potassium salt or mixtures thereof and more preferably a sodium salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Polyphosphates with an average anion chain length of greater than four usually occur as glassy materials. As defined herein a &ldquo;glassy&rdquo; material is one which is amorphous. Preferred in this invention are the linear &ldquo;glassy&rdquo; polyphosphates having the formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>XO(XPO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>X </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> wherein X is sodium, potassium, or hydrogen and n averages greater than or equal to 6 or mixtures thereof. Such polyphosphates are manufactured by FMC Corporation and are commercially known as Sodaphos (n&ap;6), Hexaphos (n&ap;113), and Glass H (n&ap;21). Hexaphos and Glass H are preferred with Glass H being the most preferred polyphosphate. These polyphosphates may be used alone or in combination. A broad range of phosphates and their sources are described in Kirk &amp; Othmer, <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology</italic></highlight>, Fourth Edition, Volume 18, Wiley-Interscience Publishers (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferred that at least 25%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60% and most preferably at least 75%, by weight of the polyphosphates, of the polyphosphate has a particulate form. If desired 100% of the polyphosphate material can be formed from particulates. It is preferred that the particulate polyphosphate form has a minimum particle size such that the particles are retained by a 0.1 mm mesh, preferably a 0.112 mm mesh, more preferably a 0.16 mm mesh, even more preferably a 0.18 mm mesh and most preferably a 0.2 mm mesh wherein the meshes are selected from the DIN 4188 mesh series. Furthermore the particulate polyphosphate preferably has a maximum particle size such that it passes through a 2 mm mesh, preferably a 1 mm mesh, more preferably an 0.8 mm mesh, even more preferably a 0.5 mm mesh and most preferably a 0.4 mm mesh, again wherein the meshes are selected from the DIN 4188 mesh series. The solubility of the particulate polyphosphate is preferably at least 1 g per 100 ml at 25&deg; C., more preferably at least 5 g, even more preferably at least 8 g, further more preferably at least 10 g, and most preferably at least 15 g per 100 ml at 25&deg; C. Thus the solid particulate should be &ldquo;sparingly soluble&rdquo;, or preferably more soluble, as the term is defined as in the British Pharmacopoeia, 1999, Volume 1. Whilst there is no limit on the upper solubility of the polyphosphate it is preferred that it is not &ldquo;very soluble&rdquo; in water. Finally it is preferred that the polyphosphate particles have a hardness greater than 1, preferably greater than 2 on the Mohs hardness scale. The particle size, solubility and hardness properties confer a crunchy texture to the polyphosphate, and thus to the confectionery itself. These properties have been designed such that they provide a crunchy texture during the first few minutes of mastication but that the particles dissolves over time leaving a product with a non-gritty residue. This crunchy texture can be used to reinforce the oral care benefits to the consumer and also have limited mechanical cleaning benefits thus helping to reduce plaque levels. Different crunchy textures can be obtained by milling the polyphosphate to the desired particle size or by blending different commercial grades of polyphosphate to achieve the desired crunch. It is preferred the that crunchy sensation remains consumer noticeable for at least 1 minute 30 seconds, preferably for at least 2 minutes and more preferably for at least 2 minutes 30 seconds. However it is also preferred that the crunchy texture has disappeared by 5 minutes, preferably by 4 minutes so that the material does not abrade the dentin or so that the product does not have a gritty residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to have a sustained release of the polyphosphate agent from the confectionery composition. This may be accomplished by incorporating into the composition a further polyphosphate material, particularly a divalent cationic salt such as a calcium salt, which has a lower aqueous solubility than the major polyphosphate material. This can be used to tailor the release rate of polyphosphate to a required profile. By weight percent, the polyphosphate of lower solubility is generally present in no more than half, preferably no more than a quarter of the level of the more soluble material. For example, the cationic material lower solubility polyphosphate is typically present in an amount of up to about 10%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.1% to about 3%, by weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Polyphosphates such as those described not only have an anti-calculus benefit but they also provide surface conditioning effects to the teeth and other surfaces of the oral cavity. The surface conditioning effects include the effective desorption of portions of undesirable pellicle proteins; creating a hydrophilic tooth surface immediately after treatment; and maintaining these effects for extended periods of time after use. These effects result in a clean feeling, which lasts beyond consumption of the confectionery product itself and further contributes to the consumer experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The surface conditioning effects on a subject&apos;s teeth and oral mucosa can be measured in vivo. These measurements include consumer responses on questions concerning clean teeth and smooth teeth. The effect of creating a hydrophilic surface can be measured in terms of a relative decrease in water contact angles on air dried tooth and mucosal surfaces according to a method disclosed by Baeir et al &ldquo;Biophysical Modeling of Acquired Pellicle Formation on Substrata of Varying Surface Energies&mdash;an in vivo study&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Caries Research, </italic></highlight>1984, 18:408-415. The overall surface conditioning effect can also be measured by quantitative consumer studies. The surface measurements are recorded in triplicate on two separate teeth and on two separate positions on the gingival surfaces. </paragraph>

The low levels of water are required in order to ensure that the long chain polyphosphates are not hydrolysed in the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Water used in the preparation of commercially suitable compositions should preferably be of low ion content and free of organic impurities. The amount of water in a composition should be considered to be not only that added as free water, but also water, which is introduced with other materials, such as with sorbitol, silica, surfactant solutions and /or colour solutions. Furthermore, the amount of water should be considered by weight of the final composition as a whole including coat and/or filling, where appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Confectionery Carrier Material </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention are confectionery compositions wherein the carrier material comprises less than about 2%, by weight of the composition, elastomer. The exact ingredients for each product form will vary from product to product and the specific techniques will be known by one skilled in the art. However there are some general ingredients which are common to all product forms and these are discussed in more detail below. Preferred product forms are pressed tablets, low boiled candy, hard boiled candy which are readily formulated with less than about 10%, by weight of the composition, water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Confectionery compositions of the present invention comprise a carrier material. The carrier materials vary depending on the type of confectionery used and would be well known to one skilled in the art.

It is possible that centre filled confectionery composition can comprise an oral care active in the edible shell and or a different oral care active, or mixture of actives, in the edible filling. In addition the composition can comprise different flavouring agents in the shell and the filling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The confectionery products of the present invention may also comprise a crunchy particle dispersed throughout the carrier material. This crunchy particle should have the properties of the particulate polyphosphate disclosed earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the confectionery compositions of the present invention can also be coated. The outer coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer coating will essentially consist of sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, isomalt, and other crystallisable polyols. Furthermore the coating will typically consist of several opaque layers, such that the confectionery core is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be covered with a further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective purposes. The outer coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. A polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The coating is applied in a conventional manner by successive applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat, as described in WO99/44436. As the coating dries it usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants may be added. A polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The coating can further comprise coloured flakes or speckles. If the composition comprises a coat it is possible that one or more of the oral care actives can be dispersed throughout the coat. This is especially preferred if one or more oral care active is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Balance of the Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention preferably comprise safe and effective levels of one or more additional components.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from about 0.01% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 20%, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 10%, by weight, of a further oral care active selected from anti-calculus agents, anti-plaque agents, fluoride ion sources, anti-microbial agents, oral malodour control agents, desensitising agents, H-2 antagonists, antioxidants, teeth colour modifying substances nutrients, and mixtures thereof. The oral care actives preferably contain an active at a level where upon directed use, the benefit sought by the wearer is promoted without detriment to the oral surface to which it is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Oral care compositions or substances of the present invention may include many of the actives previously discussed in the art. The following is a non-limiting list of oral care actives that may be used in the present invention. It is not intended that the actives listed in these groups are mutually exclusive and a single active may be included in compositions of the present invention to have several effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Orally Active Metal Cation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention optionally comprise an orally active metal cation. The metal cation can be any monovalent or divalent cation selected from the group consisting of zinc, manganese, copper, iron, cobalt, silver, selenium, tin and vanadium; preferably from the group consisting of zinc, manganese, copper, iron, silver, and tin; more preferably from the group consisting of zinc, copper, silver and tin and most preferably from the group consisting of zinc and tin. </paragraph>

These include so called &ldquo;water-insoluble salts&rdquo; which have a solubility of less than about 0.5 g per 100 ml at 25&deg; C. and &ldquo;water soluble salts&rdquo; which have a solubility of greater than or equal to about 0.5 g per 100 ml at 25&deg; C. It is also possible to use mixtures of these salts. Such mixtures can have several advantages in the compositions of the present invention since they are likely to have different complexing properties with the polyphosphate anions. In addition they have different release rates in the saliva and can therefore act to provide controlled release profiles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Sweeteners </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Two main types of sweeteners exist; bulk sweeteners and high intensity sweeteners. In general, the amount of sweetener used will vary depending on the sweetener and the overall desired aesthetics but levels used should be high enough such that the desired level of sweetness is achieved independent from the flavour. When bulk sweeteners are used they can also assume the role of the bulking agent or filler within the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Bulk Cariogenic Sweetener: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention may comprise sweetener materials. Such materials include monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides and mixtures thereof. Examples include xylose, ribose, glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, dextrose, sucrose, sugar maltose, fructo oligo saccharide syrups, partially hydrolysed starch, or corn syrup solids and mixtures thereof. However, such materials can often lead to the formation of cavities since they are readily metabolised by bacteria and other micro-organisms in the oral cavity. It is preferred that compositions of the present invention comprise less than about 10%, preferably less than about 5%, more preferably less than about 2%, even more preferably less than about 1%, and most preferably less than about 0.5%, by weight of the composition, of cariogenic sweetener. The composition can comprise 0% cariogenic sweetener if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Bulk Non Cariogenic Sweeteners: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Compositions of the present invention preferably comprise a non- cariogenic sweetener. As used herein the term &ldquo;non-cariogenic&rdquo; refers to sweeteners which are not able to be metabolised by oral microbes and therefore do not contribute to the formation of dental caries. It is preferred that compositions of the present invention comprise greater than about 10%, preferably greater than about 20%, more preferably greater than about 30% and most preferably greater than about 40%, by weight of the composition, of non cariogenic sweetener. The composition can comprise up to 99% non-cariogenic sweetener if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Preferred bulk non cariogenic sweetening agents are sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, hydrogenated starch hydrolisate, insulin, and other non-carigenic edible polyols such as glycerin and erythritol and mixtures thereof. Most preferred are non cariogenic sweeteners selected from the group consisting of maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, sucralose, aspartame and its salts, and mixtures thereof. In general compositions comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more preferably from about 30% to about 70%, by weight, of bulk sweetener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> High Intensity Sweeteners: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> High intensity sweeteners are preferred over bulk sweeteners for use in compositions of the present invention because, for among other reasons, high intensity sweeteners may prolong the flavour of the finished gum composition during chewing. Suitable high intensity sweeteners include: dipeptide based sweeteners such as L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (Aspartame) and equivalents (described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,492,131), L-&agr;-aspartyl-N-(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-thietanyl)-D-alaninamide hydrate (Alitame) and the like; saccharin and its soluble salts eg sodium or calcium saccharin salts; cyclamate salts for example acesulfame-K and the like; chlorinated derivatives of sucrose such as chlorodeoxysucrose and the like; and protein based sweeteners, such as Thaumatin (talin). Compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from about 0.01% to about 2.0%, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.5%, by weight, of high intensity sweetener. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Preparation of Compositions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention are prepared by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In order to prevent hydrolysis of the polyphosphate material it is preferred that the polyphosphate is not pre-dispersed is in water prior to addition to the composition. It is therefore preferred that the polyphosphate be added as a solution. If the composition comprises more than one phase, in general the different phases will be prepared separately, with materials of similar phase partitioning being added in any order. The two phases will then be combined with vigorous stirring to form the multiphase system eg an emulsion or dispersion. Any ingredients in the formulation with high volatility, or which are susceptible to hydrolysis at high temperatures, will usually be added post mixing of the different phases with gentle stirring. Typical confectionery methods are highly suitable for manufacturing of compositions of the present invention. Finally if the products are coated the coating step is conducted as a final step. The coating can be applied by panning or spray dried techniques commonly known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Sugar is dissolved in water and heated under stirring to 110-112&deg; C. Glucose syrup is then added and the mix heated to 141-142&deg; C. to boil off water. Batch is drawn down under vacuum and polyphosphate/flavours added at approx 90&deg; C. in low humidity environment. Batch is folded on a hot table and subsequently cooled on cold table (20&deg; C.) prior to transfer to the batch forming and die cutting apparatus. Final product has a Glass like translucent appearance. Centre-filled candies are prepared by co-extruding liquid centre at same temperature as hard candy such that a liquid filled tube is formed which is passed through the die cutter to form sealed candies. Sugarfree candy making process is similar to above except the Isomalt is dissolved in water up to 110&deg; C. and then cooked to 141-145&deg; C. Rest of process is similar to sugarbased drops.
