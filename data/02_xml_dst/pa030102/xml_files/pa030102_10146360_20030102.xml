<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device known as a stream adjuster. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the printing industry, shingling of streams of paper is one of the basic processes utilized in web printing. Shingling originally started out as a means to handle increased production speeds. A single file stream spaced by copies width typically travels at a surface speed which can be six times higher than shingled copies with a 2&Prime; shingle pitch. As the years have passed, many additional pieces of equipment such as folders, trimmers, and stackers have assumed that the incoming stream of copies to be processed would be shingled. One of the well known methods of shingling is know as the fly shingling apparatus which is relying on precise mechanical timing such that it contributes to lower products which can be as low as 50% of the design speed of the web press which it serves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One of the problems associated with high speed operation of many of these devices is that if the incoming stream of product is not precisely aligned, and spaced, problems will occur. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a steam adjuster which can handle misaligned product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for adjusting paper copies comprising an input conveyor, a singulating device having a vertically moving gate member, a first abutting surface formed on the movable gate member, a second fixed abutting surface formed rearwardly of the movable gate member, means for moving the gate member vertically in a reciprocal manner; and an output conveyor to receive copies from the singulating device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The stream adjuster of the present invention permits the straightening and shingling of misaligned copies and can be used as a portion of an integrator machine wherein two sets of stream adjusters can process two incoming streams of copies from two individual conveyors in order to integrate them into one stream. The stream adjusters can be perfectly timed to work together so that both streams of books which meet together at one point accurately overlap one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The stream adjuster of the present invention can also be incorporated in other copy handling apparatuses and such machines are well known in the art.</paragraph>

A motor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) has a motor shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a pulley <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Extending between housing side walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and through plates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> suitably mounted within bearings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are a plurality of pulleys; a first relatively large diameter pulley <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent side wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while mounted inwardly therefrom is a smaller diameter pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Three pulleys <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are mounted intermediate plates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for reasons which will become evident hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A cross member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends between housing side walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and includes flanges or ears <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extending outwardly therefrom.

Mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A drive belt <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends between pulley <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> mounted on motor shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to thereby rotatably drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A second drive belt <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends between pulley <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and pulley <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to thereby rotatably drive shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A plurality of eagle belts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending about pulleys <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and are further supported by pulleys <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on a shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as will be discussed in greater detail hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As may be best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is provided an input assembly generally designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which serves to nip the input product to eagle belts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. To this end, there are provided a pair of rider wheels <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> connected by a belt <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. An air cylinder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> allows for adjustment thereof. There is a similar assembly on the other side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As may be best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, there is provided a singulating unit which is generally designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Singulating unit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes a fixed member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having a lower surface functioning as a guide <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> while there are provided stripper FIGS. <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> There is provided a moveable gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which is mounted in bearing <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is driven by means of a shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> connected to cam <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which is mounted on shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. At the bottom of gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, there are provided center wheels <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which are small ball bearing wheels located in the main body of gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, there is provided a first abutting surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> formed on gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> while rearwardly thereof there is a second abutting surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Mounted rearwardly of gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are three guide wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which are fixed and mounted to depress eagle belts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably &frac78; of an inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> There is also provided an output assembly <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> similar to input assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thus, there are provided first and second rider wheels <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> interconnected by a belt <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> while an air cylinder <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided to permit adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In operation, a stream of product is fed into the stream adjuster <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the product P may be misaligned and separated by varying amounts as shown by reference characters X, Y and Z. After passing through the stream adjuster <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, there are shingled with uniform spacing as indicated by reference character X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At input assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the product P is nipped securely to the eagle belts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and this provides immediate traction. Thus, the speed at which the copies should be processed into the stream adjuster is matched and the arrangement is such to advance the copies to the singulating mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Guide <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is there to guide any incoming product which is either slightly curved upwardly or copies which may have lifted slightly because of the speed at which the product is traveling along the conveyor. Stripper fingers guide the product at a decreased angle towards the gate and prevent the copies from lifting up when they are moved forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The shingle width is determined by the ratio of sprockets on wheels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Depending on the number of teeth on each sprocket or wheel, the width between the copies of the product may be increased or decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When a skewed copy hits either first abutting surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> or second abutting surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, it will automatically be corrected towards a 90&deg; placement. A first copy will hit first abutting surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Upon movement of gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> upwardly, the copy will proceed through the gate and under three guide wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. When the gate is in an upper position, second abutting surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is utilized to stop the next copy of the product. A downward movement of a gate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will then allow the product to be released from second abutting surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and pass through the gates and guide wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the above described embodiment is for purposes of illustration only and that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention </paragraph>
