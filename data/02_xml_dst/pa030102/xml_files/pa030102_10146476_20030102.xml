<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to cationic ion pairing reagents and families of cationic ion pairing reagents, where combustion products of the reagents are volatile and include O or S or halogen atoms or combinations thereof as their only heteroatoms, and where the reagents can be used in conjunction with gas-phase or vapor-phase element-specific detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention relates to cationic ion pairing reagents and families of cationic ion pairing reagents including a cation and a counterion, where combustion products of the reagents are volatile and include O or S or halogen atoms or combinations thereof as their only heteroatoms, and where the reagents can be used in conjunction with gas-phase or vapor-phase element-specific detectors (ESDs), such as nitrogen-selective gas-phase chemiluminescence detectors, nitrogen-phosphorus thermoionic detectors, atomic emission plasma detectors, inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) detectors, element-specific GC detectors such as nitrogen or phosphorus specific GC detectors, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to form a cationic ion pairing reagent, a cation with a hydrophobic portion and a counterion, an anion must be present. Typically, the hydrophobicity of the counterion is low to promote the interaction of the anionic analytes and the cationic pairing ions. The counterion of the cationic pairing ion can be derived either from strong electrolytes or weak electrolytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The typical cationic ion pairing reagents are derived from weak bases (i.e., bases with pK<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>values in the 2 to 10 range) or strong bases and contain sufficiently hydrophobic alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl moieties. Typically, the weak base-derived cationic pairing ions are primary, secondary or tertiary ammonium ions; while the strong base-derived cationic pairing ions are quaternary ammonium ions and phosphonium ions. The counterions are typically inorganic anions, such as hydroxide ions, halide ions, oxyhalide ions, sulfate ions, bisulfate ions, sulfite ions, bisulfite ions, nitrate ions, nitrite ions, phosphate ions, hydrogen phosphate ions, dihydrogen phosphate ions, carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions or borate ions, or organic anions, such as carboxylate ions, phenolate ions, sulfonate ions, organic sulfate ions or organoboronate ions. Typically, ion pairing reagent compositions that contain only strong electrolyte ions are preferred, because they do not significantly alter the pH of the solutions that comprise them, and because they typically do not participate in acid-base reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of amines or quaternary ammonium compounds as cationic pairing ions with nitrogen-selective detectors is undesirable, because they contribute a high background signal level. Phosphonium cations are also undesirable with gas-phase ESDs, because their combustion products are not sufficiently volatile to leave the gas-phase detector systems as vapors or gases and contaminate the detector systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art for cationic ion pairing reagents and cationic ion pairing reagent systems whose combustion products are volatile and do not significantly interfere with post-combustion element-specific detection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The inventor has found that a new class of cationic ion pairing reagents and cationic ion pairing reagent systems can be constructed that allow element specific detection of analytes without the typical contamination of the analytes by the combustion products of the cationic ion pairing reagent components that contain a desired detectable element or lack the needed volatility to pass through the analytical system without fouling the system. The cationic ion pairing reagent compositions that have volatile combustion products and include only O or S or halogen atoms or their combinations as the only heteroatoms make possible the use of ESDs in areas which hitherto have been unaccessible to ESDs, because prior art cationic ion pairing reagent compositions included undesired heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen atoms in protonated amines and quaternary ammonium compounds), or atoms whose combustion products are nonvolatile, cannot leave the analytical system component such as the ESDs as vapors or gases thereby contaminating the components such as the ESDs (e.g., phosphorus atoms in phosphonium compounds and orangophosphates or metals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention broadly relates to cationic ion pairing reagents and families of cationic ion pairing reagents or in situ formed cationic pairing ions or families of in situ formed cationic pairing ions whose combustion products are volatile and have only O or S or halogen atoms or their combinations as heteroatoms, where the reagents or in situ formed cationic pairing ions can be used in conjunction with gas-phase or vapor-phase element-specific detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the reagents are designed for use primarily in aqueous solution, where the solvent in water, the reagents can also be used with non-aqueous or mixed aqueous/non-aqueous solvent systems such as solvent systems including, water, a lower alcohol, a lower carboxylic acid, a lower ether, a lower cyclic ether, a lower ester, a lower ketone, a lower halocarbon, and/or a lower hydrocarbon or mixtures and combinations thereof. The term lower means that the compounds have 10 or fewer carbon atoms, preferably 8 or fewer carbon atoms and particularly 6 or fewer carbon atoms. All of the solvents for use in this invention must have volatile combustion products with O or S or halogen atoms or combinations thereof as their only heteroatoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to cationic ion pairing reagent systems capable of covering a desired hydrophobicity range including a plurality of cationic ion pairing reagents or families of cationic ion pairing reagents or in situ formed cationic pairing ions or families of in situ formed cationic pairing ions of this invention. </paragraph>
