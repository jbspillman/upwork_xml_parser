<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Method and device for determining contact between a tool and a workpiece clamped on a processing machine. A signal, such as a high-frequency electrical current signal or an acoustic signal, is supplied between a location at the tool and a location at the workpiece. For as long as the tool and the workpiece are not in contact with each other, the signal has a specific amplitude. As soon as the tool and the workpiece make contact with each other, the two locations are additionally connected through a resistor connected parallel to the resistance of the machine. Thereby the amplitude changes significantly. The process can be performed manually and automatically. It can also be employed at a quasi-standstill of tool and/or workpiece, but also when the elements are moving. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method and a device for detecting contact between a tool and a workpiece clamped on a processing machine. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For finishing the tooth surfaces of pre-toothed workpieces, tool and workpiece must be brought into a contact position such that for dual-flank machining the &ldquo;center of a tool tooth&rdquo; is aligned with the &ldquo;center of a workpiece tooth space&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A well-known method for solving this object resides in that the tool and the workpiece are moved toward each other to such an extent that the tool enters with one tooth or several teeth, depending on the type of tool, into one or several tooth spaces of the workpiece and that the distance of the flanks of both elements is subsequently reduced by a relative movement, for example, a rotating movement of the tool or the workpiece, to such an extent that the flanks come into contact with each other. The position of the first contact is stored. Subsequently, the sign of the relative movement is reversed and the first contact of the counter flanks is determined. The center point between these two positions is the centering position. It is desirable to know this centering position with micrometer precision (relative to the tool circumference or workpiece circumference). For this purpose, the first contact must be determined reliably and precisely. Since during the advancement between the tool and the workpiece the tooth of the tool is not necessarily positioned opposite a space of the workpiece and, in particular, for automatically performed contact determination, the tip of the tool tooth may impact the tip of the workpiece tooth, this first contact must also be evaluatable in a reliable way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The desire to reliably determine the first contact between a tool and a workpiece exists also outside of the area of machining of toothed wheels, for example, in milling of high-precision workpieces, particularly in cases in which the machining process occurs at contact locations which are difficult to access or are not visible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various methods are known for determining the first contact when positioning a tool for a metal-removing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Methods using a light slit are not sufficiently precise and practically cannot be automated, in particular, in the case of difficult-to-access contact locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Methods based on measuring and evaluating forces between tool flank and workpiece flank, moments about the rotational tool axis or rotational workpiece axis, solid-borne sound due to the friction between the tool flank and the workpiece flank require as a prerequisite that, after contact has occurred, first a satisfactory prestress of the system must be provided in order to obtain signals having a sufficiently large spacing from unavoidable, process-related interfering signals. This prestress can even result in workpiece surfaces already being clearly machined locally. Therefore, such principles are ruled out for high-precision requirements. Furthermore, the method of evaluating solid-borne sound signals resulting from the friction between the tool and the workpiece has the disadvantage that it cannot be employed in a quasi-standstill operation because no signals occur that may be evaluated in a meaningful way. What is meant by a quasi-standstill is a very slow advancing movement or a step-wise advancing movement of, for example, 1 &mgr;m, with no overlaying cutting motion in either case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another well-known method the contact is to be determined by direct-current or direct-voltage signals. For this purpose, the two poles of the source are connected with the tool or with a location in the vicinity of the tool and with the workpiece or a location in the vicinity of the workpiece and the voltage between the two poles is measured. In this case, an electric connection exists between the poles via the machine and upon contact between the tool and the workpiece an additional connection exists through the contact location. As long as the electric resistance via the contact location is very small, compared to the resistance through the machine, the contact can be reliably determined. However, the problem in this connection is that the direct-current resistance between the mechanical machine elements may vary in an undefined way between almost infinite and very small values up to the magnitude of the transition resistance at contact between the workpiece and the tool. A reliable evaluation is not possible in this way. Low resistance values cause high currents and this can cause corrosion problems, for example, in bearings. A complete electrical isolation of tool axis and workpiece axis can only be achieved at high costs, especially in the case of workpieces or machines of medium or large dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The object following from the facts as discussed above is to develop a method and a device for detecting the first contact on positioning a tool relative to the workpiece, wherein both elements are received on a machine tool in such a way as during the machining process itself. The method should be simple and operate reliably and with high precision. Manual operation should be possible, but also an automated operation. Operation should be possible in a quasi-standstill position, but also when one element is moved, for example, a milling cutter, or when both elements are rotated, as, for example, in continuously operating gear cutting processes. Finally, it should also operate reliably when the contact occurs at contact locations which are difficult to access or not visible, as is the case, for example, with gear shaping of internal toothings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the inventive method a high-frequency electrical current signal is employed as the signal. The corresponding device has the signal source which supplies the high-frequency electrical current signal and whose internal resistance is high in comparison to the resistance of the machine between the two connecting points. The signal supplied between the connecting points is supplied to the evaluation device which evaluates this signal and sends an output signal to the machine control for further processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an alternative inventive method an acoustic signal is used as a signal. Accordingly, the device used for performing this method has the sound source which supplies the acoustic signal and the sound receiver which receives the acoustic signal and transforms it into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is supplied to an evaluation device which evaluates the signal and sends a corresponding output signal to the machine control for further processing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the case of a gear-shaping machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> having a tool spindle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a workpiece spindle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a pre-toothed workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the first contact is to be determined, for example, during the course of positioning the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relative to the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, a high-frequency electrical signal is supplied between the locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the tool spindle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the workpiece spindle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or, in a second embodiment, a solid-borne sound source or a solid-borne sound receiver is connected to location <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a solid-borne sound source or a solid-borne sound receiver to location <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A signal path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the machine (high resistance) exists between locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as long as no contact has yet occurred between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When contact occurs between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a signal path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (small resistance) is present. As long as no contact occurs between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the signal path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is interrupted at the contact location <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this case, a specific voltage is present between locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or a specific solid-borne sound level at the signal receiver. As soon as contact occurs between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the signal path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is activated, the respective signal changes very significantly due to the small resistance connected in parallel. This signal change can easily be evaluated as a contact-detection signal. Resistance in this instance means the electrical resistance as well as the sound resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) a high-frequency electrical signal (for example, starting at 2 MHz) is employed between a location <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or in the vicinity thereof and a location <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or in the vicinity thereof and the voltage is measured between these locations. As long as no contact occurs between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the connection between these locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> only exists via the path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The resistance is high for the high-frequency signal. Upon contact between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a low resistance, essentially via the contact location <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and parts of the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, tool spindle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and workpiece spindle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is connected parallel to the high resistance via the machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This results in a high voltage drop for a corresponding internal resistance of the signal source. This voltage drop occurs without any significant force at the contact location <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The signal can be easily evaluated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Advantages of using high-frequency electrical signals include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> High frequency bridges (capacitively) an electrical isolation. This can sometimes occur in the case of bearings, guide paths etc., particularly when these elements are moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The coupled mechanical elements constitute a relatively uniform and high impedance (predominantly inductive) for the high frequency. As a result, the signal change upon contact between the tool and the workpiece can be evaluated reliably and easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> High frequency permits a frequency-selective evaluation whereby the signal-to-background ratio is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> High frequency allows in a simple way (capacitively) the coupling of the signals of stationary machine elements into moving ones. The same applies to decoupling of the signals from moving machine elements to stationary ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the left portion shows the equivalent circuit diagram of the machine tool according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in its right portion it shows an example of the configuration of a device for detecting the contact. The locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are connected to a resistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> via the signal path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and via the signal path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and to a switch formed by the contact location <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This switch is initially open during positioning of the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The switch is closed upon contact between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> generates a high-frequency signal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Due to the internal resistance of a signal source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, divided into the individual resistors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which resistance should be significantly greater than that of the complex resistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the signal path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a signal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a corresponding amplitude is created at the input locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> because of the resistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When contact occurs, the amplitude of the signal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> changes significantly because of the contact <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the complex resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is significantly smaller than the one of the path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This condition is met when contact occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The course of the signal amplitude shortly before contact occurs is not abrupt, due to the building capacity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> positioned parallel to the switch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. With certain contact surfaces, an approaching position can already be observed in the &mgr;m-range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the vicinity of the locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the signals <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are tapped and supplied to a frequency-selective measuring receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a signal evaluation device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The receiver feeds an evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which evaluates the measuring signal according to value and/or phase and supplies it as an analog signal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to a comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The digital output signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is supplied to the machine control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. There, the movement of the axes of the machine tool <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled in a suitable and well-known manner. Also, the analog signal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can additionally be supplied to the machine control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to already evaluate an approaching position. This makes it possible to operate at a higher positioning speed until shortly before contact occurs and to perform the process of contact detection in a shorter time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> solid-borne sound source <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is arranged at the location <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or in the vicinity thereof and a solid-borne sound receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is arranged at the location <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or in the vicinity thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The signal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be in the ultrasound range. As long as no contact occurs between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for the sent solid-borne sound signal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> there is only a connection between the locations <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through the machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the path <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the solid-borne sound resistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The resistance of the solid-borne sound resistor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is high on this path, the received signal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is low. Upon contact between the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a significantly lower solid-borne sound resistance <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, essentially created by the contact location <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and parts of the tool <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the tool spindle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the workpiece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the workpiece spindle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is connected parallel to the high resistance through the machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This results in a strong increase of the solid-borne sound signal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the receiver <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This increase occurs without any significant force at the contact location; the signal can be easily evaluated. For increasing the signal-to-background ratio the evaluation can be realized through the frequency-selective measuring receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This receiver supplies the evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which evaluates the measuring signal according to value and/or phase and supplies it as an analog signal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The digital output signal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is supplied to the machine control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. There, the movement of the axes of the machine is controlled in a suitable and well-known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The proposed method and the proposed device for determining contact between a tool and a workpiece can be utilized not only during the positioning process but also during machining. This makes it possible to move through the contact-free paths at a high advancing or feed speed and to switch to machining speed when contact occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the particulars thereof. The present invention is intended to include modifications which would be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the subject matter pertains without deviating from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
