<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There have been numerous studies on feeding long chain omega-3 fatty acids to broiler chickens. The purpose of these studies was primarily to enrich the meat with omega-3 fatty acids in order to provide consumers with a non-fish based source of these fatty acids in their diets. In general, large quantities (&gE;approximately 6 g) of long chain omega-3 fatty acids were fed to the birds during the production period. As used herein, the terms production period and production cycle referred to the life cycle of the bird until slaughter. The researchers reported increased levels of long chain omega-3 fatty acids in the meat and flavor scores the same as or worse than control (non-enriched) broiler meat. The inventors are unaware of any studies reporting improved tenderness, taste or consumer acceptability of broiler meat when poultry are fed long chain omega-3 and/or omega-6 fatty acids. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While conducting tests on enriching poultry meat with omega-3 fatty acids, the option of feeding much lower omega-3 and omega-6 long chain HUFA contents in their rations than had previously been tested was investigated. When a test panel evaluated cooked meat samples, it was unexpectedly found that the enriched meat had higher taste, tenderness, and overall acceptability scores than the control meat. Thus it was found that the meat could be significantly enriched with omega-3 fatty acids (with about 2 to 6 times the amount of long chain omega-3 fatty acids found in regular meat) by providing nutritionally significant levels of long chain omega-3 fatty acids. This is an additional benefit to consumers because of the well-known health benefits of long chain omega-3 fatty acids. At the same time however, the overall consumer acceptability of the meat as compared to regular meat could also be improved. Another benefit is that the overall polyunsaturated fat content of the meat is increased also improving the nutritional quality of the meat for consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While not wishing to be bound by any theory, the benefit of low levels of long chain omega-3 and omega-6 HUFAs in poultry rations is most likely due to DHA and in this case DPA(n-6) substituting for shorter chain and less unsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipids of the meat. This substitution could improve the fluidity of the phospholipids membranes and directly impact the other functional properties of the meat. This effect of low levels of enrichment has not been observed previously possibly because of the emphasis on high levels of enrichment, higher levels of incorporation may lead to too much fluidity in the membranes adversely affecting functionality and/or cause enrichment of significant amounts of triglycerides in the meat which are less stable leading to organoleptic problems. Additionally many previous studies used less concentrated forms of omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil that has about 20-25% omega-3 fatty acids as % total fatty acids. The other 75% of the oil is made up of saturated and monounsaturated and some polyunsaturated fatty acids that can also incorporate in the meat in an untargeted manner causing unwanted functionality problems. By using a more concentrated form of highly unsaturated fatty acids in the omega-3 and omega-6 series, in one embodiment about 55% of the fatty acids in the LCHUFA source were DHA(n-3) and DPA(n-6) fatty acids, the enrichment of the phospholipids can be directed more accurately to substitution by these highly unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally it is possible that use of the longest chain fatty acids in the omega-3 and omega-6 series provides fatty acids with the most potential for influencing the fluidity of the phospholipid-based membranes in the meat because of the high level of unsaturation in these fatty acids and because of the positive impact of the tertiary structure of these fatty acids (e.g. helical structure of DHA making it able to tightly pack in membranes like a saturated fatty acid but have the flexibility of a highly unsaturated fatty acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferred Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the omega-3 series DHA, EPA, DPA, ARA and SDA can be used but more preferred are DHA and DPA(n-3). In the omega-6 series sources of ARA and DPA(n-6) can be used but DPA(n-6) is more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The HUFA supplement preferably contains long chain omega-3 fatty acids, more preferably DHA, more preferably DHA and a long chain omega-6 source, most preferably DHA(n-3) and DPA(n-6). Preferably, low levels of omega-3, preferably DHA, are fed to the fowl. Preferably, some long chain omega-6, preferably DPA(n-6), is fed to the fowl. Preferably, the ratio of omega-3 HUFA to omega-6 HUFA is in the range from about 2:1 to about 4:1. Preferably, the long chain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are fed to the fowl during the last half of the production cycle and more preferably during the last 25% of the production cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The amount of long chain omega-3 and omega-6 HUFAs fed during the production cycle are preferably in the range from about 0.2 to about 2.4 g/kg final body weight, more preferably from about 0.4 to about 1.75, more preferably from about 0.6 to about 1.25, and more preferably from about 0.7 to about 1.0 g/kg final body weight. Preferably, a concentrated form of long chain omega-3 and/or omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is fed to the fowl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, greater than 25% of the total fatty acids are omega-3 and/or omega-6 long chain HUFA, more preferably more than 30%, even more preferably 40%, and most preferably greater than 50%.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Example 1. Effect of low levels of long chain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on the taste, tenderness and overall consumer acceptability of poultry meat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A study was conducted to determine the effect of feeding low levels of long chain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on the organoleptic properties of meat and determine the enrichment levels of these fatty acids in the resulting meat. Broiler chickens were selected as the experimental production animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The broiler strain utilized was Avian (female)&times;Ross (male) cross. This strain has a capacity for high performance and represents normal genetic stock found in the poultry industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Broilers were housed at hatch, sexed at the research site, and immediately began the dietary treatments. The pens provided 0.75 ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per broiler chicken. The trial ran from 0-49 days of age with the long chain omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid source added to the rations from day 36-day 49. There were three treatments in the trial with 10 replications per treatment (70 broilers per replication) for a total of 2100 birds on study. The treatments are outlined in Table 1. The broilers were blocked by randomizing weights across all pens ensuring that weights would be equal among pens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Commercial type feeds were formulated and fed (crumbles in starter ration and pelleted in grower and finisher rations) (Table 2.). Normal rations (without test material) were fed from 0-35 days of age. Test material was added to the rations from day 36 to market age (49 days of age) during the Grower II and Finisher phases of the study. Formulations were prepared with the following considerations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 1) treatments were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric as well as iso- all other nutrients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 2) Grower II ration used the same formulation as Grower I but with the added source of DHA and DPA(n-6). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 3) The diets conformed to industry standards and met or exceeded the nutritional requirements set forth in: Nutrient Requirements of Poultry, 9<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>rev. ed., National Research Council, 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) Sacox (Salinomycin (60) manufactured by Hoechst: 60 grams per ton of feed) was used in the starter and grower rations and BMD (manufactured by Alfarma: 50 grams per ton of feed) was used in all feeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The nutrient requirements for the formulated feeds are summarized in Table 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Body weights and feed consumption were measured during the study. At the end of the trial the animals were sacrificed and samples of breast and thigh meat collected for fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography. Breast and thigh samples were also frozen and sent to an independent university laboratory (Dept. of Food Science, Colorado State University) for organoleptic analysis by a consumer taste panel. Samples of meat were sent to the University of Colorado Dept. of Food Science for organoleptic analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> For the consumer taste panel (100 untrained panelists) a Rank Order of Preference Test was used to evaluate the samples. Meat testing is disclosed in the AMSA Research Guide for Cookery, Sensory Evaluation and Instrumental Tenderness Measurements of Fresh Meat (1995), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A limit of 4 samples for analysis were selected to prevent panel member sample over-load. Frozen meat samples were thawed and then baked at 350&deg; F. to an endpoint temperature of 165&deg; F. (internal). Approximately 7g samples of each treatment were presented to panelists simultaneously in 60 g portion cups. Scorecards were attached. The panelists were asked to rate the samples for flavor, tenderness and overall acceptability. For each characteristic there was a rating scale of 1-4: 1&equals;like best; 2&equals;like moderately; 3&equals;like slightly; 4&equals;like least. The results were analyzed by Chi square analysis. For the chicken breast samples, the results indicated a Rank order of Preference of treatment 2, 4, 1 (control). Results were significant at the p&lt;0.05 level for these comparisons. For the chicken thigh samples, the results indicated a Rank order of Preference of treatment 2, 4, 1 (control). Results were significant at the p&lt;0.05 level for these comparisons. In summary, the results indicated that adding HUFAs to the broiler rations increased taste, tenderness and overall acceptability of the breast meat and increased tenderness in the thigh meat without compromising taste or overall acceptability.
