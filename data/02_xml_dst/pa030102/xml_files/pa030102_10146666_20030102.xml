<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an installation for transporting objects, in particular items of clothing hanging on clothes hangers, according to the preamble of claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such installations transport the objects on conveying paths by means of a transporting roller, containing two parallel spaced-apart flanges on the end sides and a central part located therebetween as well as a through-passage opening leading through the center between the flanges and the central part, the central part having at least one peripheral, annular circumferential part which can rotate separately from the two flanges, and the two flanges being connected to one another and to the circumferential part such that, in the case of the circumferential part rotating as a result of bearing on the conveying path, the two flanges are in a rest state irrespective of the rotation, a hook-like carrier element for an object which is to be transported passing through the through-passage opening and projecting from the latter by way of its free end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The transporting roller of the abovementioned transporting installation is known from EP 10 13 569 A1 and is designed in order to avoid the smoothing effect which arises with a build-up of at least two transporting rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an installation which is intended for transporting objects of the type mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 and ensures, by straightforward means, the reliable transportation of objects which are to be transported on conveying paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by the features of claim 1. Advantageous developments of the invention are specified in the subclaims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the invention provides that the conveying path comprises a fixed rolling ridge with a transporting-roller running track on its top side, the transporting roller riding on the rolling ridge, the two flanges of the transporting roller engaging laterally around the rolling ridge, and the circumferential part of the transporting roller engaging with transporter-roller running track, and that guided along the rolling ridge, spaced apart laterally from the same at least corresponding to the thickness of the flange projecting there, is a comb-like conveying mechanism, of which the gaps or clearances are dimensioned for the engagement of the free end of the hook-like carrier element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This manner of transporting-roller movement allows a straightforward design of the transporting means for the transporting roller in the form of a comb-like conveying mechanism which can be moved along the conveying path and in the gaps of which the free end of the hook-like carrier element for the goods which are to be transported can be accommodated in order for the transporting roller to be carried along. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The comb-like conveying mechanism is advantageously connected to a link chain running parallel to the conveying path, in particular a laterally curved chain of a drive arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The comb-like conveying mechanism preferably comprises tines in the form of regularly spaced-apart carry-along pins which extend perpendicularly to the through-passage opening of the transporting roller and perpendicularly to the transporting-roller running track, in order to provide the highest possible clearance for the reliable engagement of the free end of the hook-like carrier element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a particularly advantageous development of the invention, the rolling ridge, provided by the transporting-roller running track, is formed as part of a profile rail, in which the link chain is guided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This profile rail preferably has a generally C-shaped cross section, an upwardly oriented edge of the C-profile rail forming the transporting-roller running track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The comb-like conveying mechanism preferably spans to the full extent, by way of its tines, the gap between the mutually facing edges of the C-profile rail for the purposes of providing a clearance which is bounded at the top and bottom, in order for the free end of the hook-like carrier element, and thus the transporting roller, to be reliably secured throughout the conveying displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An advantageous development of the invention provides that the installation has a location for supplying or introducing the transporting roller(s) into the conveying path, having a downwardly sloping section which opens out laterally into the conveying path and comprises a fixed rolling ridge with a transporting-roller running track on its top side, said rolling ridge opening out into the rolling ridge of the conveying path, there being provided in the downwardly sloping section, on which the transporting roller(s) is or are conveyed to the conveying path by the action of gravitational force, an arrangement for restraining the transporting roller(s), which can be released synchronously with the presence of a gap of the conveying mechanism in the supply location, with account being taken of the period of time taken for the respective transporting roller to come into contact with this gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> At this introduction location, or generally in the case of diverters which open out into the conveying path, the gap sequence of the conveying mechanism is coordinated with the timing of the respective diverter. Provided for this purpose is a corresponding clock generator, for example in the form of a gearwheel, which engages in the gaps of the comb-like conveying mechanism, or the spaced-apart tines thereof, and controls the diverter in a correspondingly synchronous manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The restraining arrangement at the abovementioned location for introducing transporting rollers into the conveying path preferably comprises a restraining pin for releasing a leading transporting roller and a further restraining pin for restraining trailing transporting rollers, it being possible for the restraining pins to be moved in the direction of their longitudinal axes between a restraining position in front of the respective transporting roller and a release position, in which they are disengaged from the respective transporting roller. The restraining pins can preferably be moved essentially perpendicularly to the transporting-roller running track of the downwardly sloping section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides that the conveying path comprises at least one ejecting location or discharging line which branches off from it and has a downwardly sloping section, which has a fixed rolling ridge with a transporting-roller running track on its top side and on which the transporting roller(s) is or are conveyed to a collecting location by the action of gravitational force, the ejecting location comprising a diverter which can optionally be brought up to the conveying path in order to transfer the transporting roller(s) to the downwardly sloping section of the ejecting location, with the free end of the hook-like carrier element passing through the through-passage opening thereof, being disengaged in the process.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Since the conveying principle according to the invention of an installation for transporting objects is based on a specifically configured transporting roller with fixed side parts and a rotatable annular part in the center, this transporting roller, which is described in more detail, for example, in EP 1 013 569 A1, will be explained in more detail hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in which the same parts with the same functions have the same designations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> essentially comprises two parallel disk-like outer flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the end sides in each case, the elements referred to above as fixed side parts, and a central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> located therebetween, the element referred to above as a rotary annular part. Provided along the associated center axis <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a through-passage opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in which a securing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is optionally located. The transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected, via its through-passage opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, to an arcuate carrier element or hook <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of a hanger, on which items of clothing are conveyed in the transporting installation in question. For this purpose, the central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> bears on a rolling ridge, which will be explained in more detail at a later stage in the text, of a conveying path of the transporting installation, the inclination of the same making it possible for the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the carrier element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in the form of a clothes-hanger hook, bears on the ends of the securing-part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in each case. The securing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a hollow-cylindrical bushing, of which the end regions are bent outward in each case by riveting <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The inner construction of the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot readily be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. The transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thus shown in section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is located between the first flange <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the second flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, has an annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which forms part of the first disk-like flange <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is directed towards the second flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is extended on one side and has a central bore as through-passage opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of standard diameter. The annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a slightly inclined outer surface from its point of attachment to the first flange <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to its free end region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is flattened perpendicularly to the center axis <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The slightly inclined outer surface of the annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, at the same time, constitutes the inner running surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the rolling bodies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a rolling-contact bearing. A multiplicity of rolling bodies are usually necessary for a reliably functioning rolling-contact bearing. The inner running surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has, in the center, an encircling groove-like depression <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is adapted in an accurately dimensioned manner to the outer surfaces of the rolling body <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and in which the rolling bodies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can move. On the outside, the rotatable circumferential part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in the form of an outer ring, encloses the rolling bodies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a radial distance from the inner running surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and it has a disk-like side wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is angled perpendicularly to the center axis <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is located on the smaller-diameter side of the annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the direction of the side of the larger annular-web diameter or of the first flange <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the outer ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably open, inter alia for assembly reasons. The outer ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided in each case with a slight amount of slot-induced play <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in relation to the inner surfaces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the first and of the second flanges <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On its paraxial inner running surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the outer ring <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may likewise contain an encircling groove-like depression <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which is likewise adapted to the surfaces of the rolling body <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The second disk-like flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is firmly secured against the free flattened end region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the securing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the securing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> pressing the second flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> onto the end region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the annular web <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by rigid riveting <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The hollow-cylindrical securing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has formed through it a channel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, into which the hook <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of a clothes hanger is introduced and pushed through until that position of the hook <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the simplest case (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>), the second flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be provided with barcodings <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the second disk-like flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has hole-like cutouts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in which, instead of the barcodings <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, coding arrangements having electrical and electronic components (these arrangements not being shown) can be fastened. The coding arrangements may be, for example, radially or circularly arranged inductive, magnetic and/or capacitive arrangements or pins, made of a material differing from the flange material, in order for it to be possible to gather the storage information therefrom. The cutouts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, however, may also constitute an annular groove in which it is possible to secure electrical components, coupled with ROM and/or RAM memory modules, which have been introduced therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As can be gathered from FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in other words has at least one peripheral annular circumferential part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which can be rotated separately from the two flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the two flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being connected to one another and to the circumferential part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> such that, in the case of the circumferential part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> rotating as a result of bearing on the conveying path, the two flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are in a rest state irrespective of the rotation. This configuration of the transporting roller is the basis for the design according to the invention, which will be explained hereinbelow, of the transporting installation for transporting, in particular, items of clothing hanging on clothes hangers. In particular, this transporting roller, with fixed outer elements and a rotating inner element, allows a transporting means or a pushing arrangement to act directly on the transporting roller. A corresponding transporting installation will be explained hereinbelow with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show, schematically, in general terms, two embodiments of the arrangement according to the invention for transporting, in particular, items of clothing hanging on clothes hangers, the installation according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> being provided for single-stage sorting, while the installation according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is provided for two-stage sorting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The transporting installation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises an open-circuit conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> with a supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at one end for unsorted goods and with an end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for the removal of sorted goods. Provided between the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the removal end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are a plurality of parallel discharging lines, of which merely four discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, on the inlet side, branch off from the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via diverters <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. On the outlet side, the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> pass over into the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> again via diverters <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Between their inlet and their outlet, the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are each provided with a downwardly sloping section, in order to transfer the incoming goods to the outlet-side diverters <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on account of the gravitational force thereof. The discharging lines provide a sorting means which is referred to here as being single-stage because the goods only pass through one or more of the discharging lines once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a modified design of the transporting installation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with two-stage sorting of goods. In addition to the design with a plurality of discharging lines which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transporting installation according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises a return line <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, via an inlet diverter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, downstream of the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In addition, the return line <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is connected to the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> upstream of the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and downstream of the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of transporting goods, the return line <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> likewise comprises a downwardly sloping section, which runs in the opposite direction to the downwardly sloping sections of the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Formed at the end of each discharging line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is a collecting location or a transfer station <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, by means of which goods coming in via the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are collected and can be introduced into the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> again in a specific manner. A similar collecting location <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is located at the end of the return line <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Details of the transporting installation according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> can be gathered from FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which show the installation in detail in the region of the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprise a respective profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with a generally C-shaped cross section. On account of the C-shaped cross section, the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is closed all the way round apart from a respective gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which is bounded by the mutually facing edges of the C-shaped profile rail. Of these two edges, the bottom or upwardly oriented edge is formed as a transporting-roller running track <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The running track <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> thus forms the top side of a respective rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which forms one of the mutually facing ends of the C-shaped profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> with the respective gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> located therebetween. The transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> showing four running-track rollers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, rides on said rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of each transporting roller being in rolling contact with the running track <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, while the lateral, stationary flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each transporting roller engage over the rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on both sides, as a result of which the respective transporting roller is guided laterally. Additional lateral guidance for the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided by the guide ridge <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which is located opposite the respective rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, constitutes that end of the respective C-shaped profile <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is located opposite the rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and engages between the two flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, albeit without coming into contact with the central part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Interacting with one another, the rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the guide ridge <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> thus provide lateral positive guidance for the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with the result that said roller cannot pass laterally out of the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> although, in the gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the latter, it can run in an essentially resistance-free manner, i.e. under rolling resistance, on the running track <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Added to this rolling resistance at most, when the goods hanging on the transporting rollers pivot laterally, is a brief contact resistance between the two flanges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the ridges <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to convey the transporting rollers on the essentially horizontally running conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or in the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, use is made of a link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, which is guided via gearwheels, spaced apart in the running direction, outside (as is shown) or alternatively within, the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and is driven via an electromotive drive (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The motion of the link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the transporting rollers with the aid of a comb-like conveying mechanism <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which runs along the gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The comb-like conveying mechanism is connected to the link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> by a connecting means (not shown) which is arranged in the profile rail and, with the link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> located on the outside, engages through a slot in the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> (said slot not being shown either) located opposite the gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The tines of the comb-line conveying mechanism <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> run perpendicularly to the through-passage opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the transporting rollers running in the gap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and perpendicularly to the transporting-roller running track <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the tines of the comb-like conveying mechanism are formed as uniformly spaced-apart carry-along pins for the free end of the hook-like carrier element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the goods-securing part, e.g. in the form of a clothes hanger. The interspaces or clearances <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the tines or carry-along pins, of which two pins are designated <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the height of these spaces are selected such that the free end of the carrier element, coming from the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, can pass into these spaces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and is then carried along together with the respective transporting roller and the goods hanging thereon. On account of the specific construction of the transporting roller, that flange <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the transporting roller which is oriented toward the interior of the profile rail engages with at least the two carry-along pins <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> defining the accommodating clearance, without relative movement, and the associated friction, occurring between these parts during the conveying movement, because these flanges are fixed and do not accompany the rolling movement of the rolling part of the transporting roller, as has been explained above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The operation of transporting rollers entering into the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will be explained hereinbelow with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As has been indicated above, the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is defined by a profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with a C-shaped cross section corresponding to the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. At least in the region of the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, that is to say at the location where the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opens out laterally into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a downwardly sloping section, of which the lowermost point is situated at the location at which the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opens out into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. On account of this downwardly sloping section, the transporting rollers, with the clothes hangers hanging on them, which are fed into the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at the other end of the latter move down the downwardly sloping section under the action of gravitational force. In order for the transporting rollers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; to be fed into the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> separately and at the appropriate point in time, that is to say when a predetermined clearance <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the comb-like conveying mechanism <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> reaches the location at which the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opens out into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a restraining arrangement is formed at the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> upstream of the opening-out location. This restraining arrangement comprises two restraining pins <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, which are spaced apart one behind the other in the longitudinal direction of the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The restraining pins <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> can have their axial position adjusted in a manner known per se by means of drive cylinders <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, with the aid of which the restraining pins <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> can optionally be displaced into a position in front of a respective transporting roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the front restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as seen in the conveying direction in the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, is located in front of the leading transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with the result that the latter butts against the restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, while the rear restraining pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is located on the rear side of said transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in front of the next, trailing transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. The leading transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has thus already been separated off from the trailing transporting rollers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, of which the roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is restrained by the rear restraining pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, while the following transporting rollers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; butt against one another and against the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Starting from the position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the next step is for the front restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then to be drawn back from its position in front of the transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when a restraining pin <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is concealed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is situated immediately in front of the location at which the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opens out into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the motion of the link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is synchronized, in a manner which is not illustrated specifically, with the actuation of the drive cylinder <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for the front restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, e.g. by means of a synchronization gearwheel <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> which interacts with the link chain <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, with account being taken of the time which is required for the released transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to run out of its restrained position, with the restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> extended, to the location at which the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> opens out into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. There, the free end of the hook-like carrier element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which is oriented inward (toward the interior of the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>.) and projects from the through-passage opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the transporting roller, engages in the clearance <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the conveying mechanism <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which is situated at the opening-out location, with the result that the transporting roller is carried along via the carrier element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The next step, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, is for a further transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime; to run up and thus form the last transporting roller of the abutting transporting rollers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime;, of which the now leading transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; comes into abutment against the restraining pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which has now been extended again, once the rear restraining pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> has been retracted. In order to separate the now leading transporting roller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the rear restraining pin <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is extended again, and the operation of separating the leading transporting roller, the beginning of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, begins anew, as has been explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A transporting-installation configuration which is similar to the supply location is located, for example, at the transition from the discharging lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. At this location, the diverters <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, as appropriate, are formed in a manner corresponding to the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at the supply location <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a location for moving the transporting rollers out of the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> onto one of the discharging lines, for example the discharging line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The discharging line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, in turn, comprises a profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which is curved similarly to the profile rail <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and opens out into the conveying path. The profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> likewise opens out into the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, which defines the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, however, serves for ejecting transporting rollers, and the goods hanging on them, from the conveying path <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Since not every transporting roller is to be transferred from the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, a diverter is formed between these two profile rails <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. This diverter comprises a rolling-ridge section <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, which is articulated pivotably on the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and a guide-ridge section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which is articulated pivotably on the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. In the pivoted-in state, the rolling-ridge section <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> forms part of the rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, while, in the pivoted-in state, the guide-ridge section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> forms part of the guide ridge <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. In the pivoted-out state, or when the diverter is positioned such that transporting rollers are to be ejected from the profile rail <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> onto the profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the rolling-ridge section <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> interrupts the rolling ridge <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the guide-ridge section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> interrupts the guide ridge <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and these sections <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the diverter, in the pivoted-out position, then adjoin a respective rolling ridge <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and a guide ridge <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, as a result of which transporting rollers arriving at the diverter are ejected into the profile rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In order to adjust the sections <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the diverter, use is made of a diverter-switching mechanism <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, which is merely illustrated schematically as a C-shaped clamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As soon as a transporting roller located on the diverter leaves the diverter, it is transported by the downward slope on the discharging line, under the action of gravitational force, to a collecting location.
