<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth is wireless communication protocol that allows a plurality of Bluetooth-enabled devices to communicate in a secure, ad-hoc fashion, by sharing user data. The shared data comprises, for example, personal identification number (PIN) codes, which are used by the Bluetooth security architecture for purposes of encryption and authentication to establish secure and trusted relationships between Bluetooth-enabled devices. More specifically, at a link layer, Bluetooth provides authentication, encryption, and key management of the various keys involved. Authentication involves the user providing a PIN that is translated into a 128-bit link key that can be authenticated in a one or two-way direction. Once devices are authenticated, the link can be encrypted at various key lengths. The link layer security framework provides various authentication schemes and a flexible encryption scheme that allows devices to negotiate for key length. Bluetooth devices that use encryption and authentication will utilize similar link keys to communicate. To provide the same link keys, either the same PIN code can be input by a user, or a mandatory, fixed PIN code (which is stored on the device and cannot be entered on the UI (user interface) level) could be used. Most Bluetooth devices, however, have different PIN codes, so that one of the devices should receive a PIN code from a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With Bluetooth devices such as display panels that do not comprise a user interface, however, it is very inconvenient to receive user data such as the PIN code from a user for purposes of authentication or encryption. On the user interface level, the user data comprises information such as a &ldquo;Bluetooth Device Address&rdquo; (BD_ADDR) (which is a unique address of the device that is used during a device discovery process), a PIN code (or Bluetooth Passkey), and a user-friendly name (or Bluetooth device name), which a user can input directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A Bluetooth device utilizes master parameters including BD_ADDR of a user and clock information for establishing a physical connection, as well as executing the steps of &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Page&rdquo; in order to exchange information. The &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; step discovers where the Bluetooth device is located and obtains the user&apos;s BD_ADDR. The &ldquo;Page&rdquo; step substantially makes connection between two devices. The user receives the BD_ADDR of the master through the &ldquo;Page&rdquo; step. Typically, the &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; process takes 15.24 seconds on average, which is a relatively long time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of utilizing user data in a Bluetooth device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, user data is input in a first Bluetooth device having a user interface (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). A second Bluetooth device having no user interface receives the user data from the first Bluetooth device and stores the data (<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). The transmission of the user data from the first device to the second Bluetooth device (no UI) may be executed when either the second Bluetooth device (no UI) is initially connected with the first Bluetooth device having a user interface or prior to utilizing the user data. Next, when a pre-allocated shortcut key is inputted (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), the second Bluetooth device (with no UI) reads out the stored user data and uses the data for communication with a Bluetooth device that corresponds to the user data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of a method of utilizing user data in a Bluetooth according to another embodiment of the present invention. The method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is similar to the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that with the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the stored user data is automatically read out, not by inputting a shortcut key, but by executing predetermined software program (<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). All other steps are similar, that is, user data is input in the first Bluetooth device with the user interface (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>), the user data is transmitted and to the second Bluetooth device (with no UI) and stored (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>), and the stored user data are read out and used for communication (<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of a method for utilizing user data in a Bluetooth device according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. User data is input in a first Bluetooth device having a user interface (<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>). A second Bluetooth device having no user interface receives the user data from the first Bluetooth device and generates a link key from the user data and stores the link key (<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). Next, when a pre-allocated shortcut key is inputted (<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>), the second Bluetooth device (with no UI) reads out the stored link key and uses the link key for communication with a Bluetooth device that corresponds to the link key (<highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of utilizing user data in a Bluetooth device according to another embodiment of the present invention. The method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is similar to the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that the stored link keys are automatically read out, not by inputting shortcut key, but by executing a predetermined software program (<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>). The other steps (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>) are similar to those illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram of an exemplary application of the present invention wherein a wireless terminal is used for connection with a body of a wireless phone. The system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, comprises a body of a wireless phone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, first-third wireless terminals <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, and a piconet <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the first wireless terminal <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> utilizes data such as the BD_ADDR and PIN code which is stored in the body of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and in the second wireless terminal <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. When a new wireless terminal (i.e., the third wireless terminal <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>) is initially connected with the wireless phone body <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the first wireless terminal <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> will receive the user data of the third wireless terminal <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> from the wireless phone body <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and then store such received data. The second wireless terminal <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> will use the data, such as the BD_ADDR and PIN code, which is already stored in the body of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the first wireless terminal <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. When the third wireless terminal <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is initially connected with the wireless phone body <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the second wireless terminal <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> receives data of the third wireless terminal <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> from the wireless phone body <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and stores the received data. On the other hand, the third wireless terminal <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> receives user data of the first and second wireless terminals <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> from the wireless phone body <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and stores the received data. Then, the wireless terminals <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> use the stored data and connect with each other for communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In general, the wireless phone is developed to use one body together with several wireless terminals. But, when using a wireless phone, after a user initially purchases the phone and sets a necessary setting, a connection should be continuously made so that the user does not have to input the data anymore. To realize this, the BD_ADDR of the body should be stored in the wireless terminal. Even when two wireless terminals are internally busy, the BD_ADDR of the terminals should be stored therein because no data may be transferred while executing the &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; or &lsquo;Page&rsquo; methods. This is especially true for systems such as wireless phones that require real time transfer of data, which can not execute the &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; or &lsquo;Page&rsquo; while transferring data. Thus, if a new terminal is required for connection on busy channel, a TDD switch method is used. But, even in this case, the BD_ADDR of the body should be stored in the wireless terminal. This is especially useful when the connection is disconnected and required for reconnection or for interphone communication between wireless terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an exemplary diagram illustrating an application of the present invention wherein a headset is used for connection with the body of an MP3 player. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the system comprises a personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, an MP3 player <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, and a headset <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The personal computer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> executes a user interface program capable of inputting user data required for the MP3 player <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The MP3 player <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> downloads an MP3 file together with user data such as BD_ADDR and PIN code, and stores them. The MP3 player <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> allocates a shortcut key for the downloaded user data. Alternatively, in case of the PIN code, the MP3 player does not store the PIN code and uses the PIN code as a variable PIN code in the state of being connected with the headset <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. The headset <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> uses the stored PIN code (which is stored as a mandatory PIN) to connect with other Bluetooth devices for communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When an MP3 file (song) is downloaded, if the BD_ADDR of the headset has been pre-stored in a flash memory of the MP3 player, a newly purchased headset may be connected with the MP3 player without any additional input of the user or simply by inputting a shortcut key. If not, whenever they are connected with each other, the MP3 player should execute the &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; and &lsquo;Page&rsquo; steps, or the user should manually input the BD_ADDR. The headset has no user interface, so that there is no method to input a PIN code therein. Thus, the headset may be sold with a mandatory fixed PIN code, which is stored therein. In this case, the MP3 player should receive the PIN code that is set forth in the manual supplied or associated with the particular headset. Likewise, if a PIN code of a newly purchased headset is pre-stored in the MP3 player when a song is downloaded from the personal computer into the MP3 player, or if the PIN code is inputted in the MP3 player when the MP3 player is initially connected with the headset, a link key is generated and stored in a flash memory. Thus, even though the connection is disconnected and reconnected, it is possible to communicate with the MP3 player and headset by using and authentication and encryption process without a new input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention advantageously allows a Bluetooth device without a user interface to utilize user data more conveniently. Also, the &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; step for obtaining the BD_ADDR of the user may be omitted to reduce the associated time loss when establishing a connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although illustrative embodiments have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes and modifications may be affected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. It is to be understood that all such changes and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
