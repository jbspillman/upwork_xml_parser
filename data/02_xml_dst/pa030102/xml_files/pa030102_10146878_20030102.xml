<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with a device for smoothening the unwinding of the loops of yarn forming the weft reserve on the cylinder of a weft supplier for a fluid jet looms, such as an air jet loom or a water jet loom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As well known, the weft suppliers are capable of storing a yarn reserve, in form of loops wound on a stationary cylinder, and of supplying the loom by unwinding a number of loops matching the length L of yarn required by the loom at each weft insertion, the length L equalling the width of the fabric being woven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the specific case of fluid jet looms, the weft supplier also has the task of pre-measuring the length L and such a task is performed by counting, typically by means of a photo-sensor, the loops of yarn which have been unwound; being</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L&equals;n&pgr;D</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> where n is the number of loops which have been unwound and D is the diameter of the stationary cylinder of the supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The unwinding of the yarn is controlled by an electrically-controlled stop comprising a movable finger that, when energized, engages the cylinder, in order to block the running of the yam when the n-th loop has been reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The operating time of the stop device mounted on current weft suppliers is quite short, typically in the range of 10 to 20 milliseconds, due to the high operating speed of a modem fluid jet loom, which is able to insert about 1500 meters of weft per minute. This fact causes a peak in the mechanical tension of the yarn, downstream of the stop finger, which tension peak must be smoothed in order to prevent breaking of the yarn. Upstream of the stop finger, it causes slackening of one or more of the loops that are wound on the terminal portion of the cylinder, because of the inertia dragging actions caused by the quick stopping of the running yarn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Nowadays, in order to avoid such phenomena and to smoothen the unwinding and stopping of the yarn as well as possible, smoothening devices of several kinds are used, typically providing a modulated braking of the weft yarn, e.g. as disclosed in prior European Patent Application No. 99112784.6. Such devices, which are interposed between the weft supplier and the loom, are put into action during the unwinding of the last loop, in order to slow down the running of the yarn while maintaining it in tension, in order to attenuate the deceleration peak of the yarn when the stop finger is driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Although such known smootheners operate satisfactorily to damp the mechanical tension in the yarn downstream of the stop finger, they are not capable of effectively preventing the slackening of the loops upstream of the stop finger. Moreover, such capability depends on the characteristics of the yarn being processed. Particularly with yarns having a slippery surface and/or having poor elasticity, the above known modulated-braking devices are unable to prevent slackening of one or more of the loops wound on the terminal portion of the cylinder of the supplier, upstream of the stop finger, probably because of their limited ability to brake the yarn and to control its mechanical tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such a circumstance is a serious drawback hindering the regular supply of the weft yarn because, at the time of releasing the next weft length, when the weft yarn is released by the stop finger for restoring its running, two or more loops, rather than single loops, are unwound from the cylinder at the same time, thereby causing the weft length L to be correspondingly increased by a factor n&plus;x (rather than n), and consequently causing the loom to stop, due to the so-called &ldquo;long weft&rdquo; signal generated by the optical sensors checking the insertion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention has the main object of removing the above drawback, and achieves this and other objects, such as will become apparent from the following disclosure, by means of a device for smoothening the unwinding of the weft yarn having the features defined in the attached claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a pneumatic device subjects the weft yarn to a fluid flow, such as an air stream flowing in the same direction as the yarn, in the path between the supplier and the loom. The flow, independently of the size and surface characteristics of the yarn and of the efficiency of the modulated braking device mounted in the same path, maintains the yarn under a constant mechanical tension, whereby, surprisingly for persons skilled in the art, the slackening of the loops wound on the terminal portion of the cylinder of the supplier, upstream of said stop finger, is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the pneumatic device that generates the fluid flow for the mechanical tensioning of the yarn comprises the already existing nozzle, mounted on a terminal yarn-guide eyelet and coupled to the modulated braking device, in which pressurized air is supplied for the pneumatic threading of the braking device. The rate of the flow is controlled by at least one flow controller which is operated&mdash;according to the features of the weft yarn and to the parameters of the weaving process&mdash;so that the mechanical tensioning of the yarn will prevent the slackening of the terminal loops on the cylinder of the supplier.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, a weft supplier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a fluid jet loom T, e.g. an air jet loom, comprises, in a way known per se, a stationary housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a stationary cylinder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of cylinder sectors that are radially adjustable in order to change the diameter D of the cylinder, and a rotating disc <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, arranged at the base of the cylinder and driven by a hollow driving shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A hollow rotating arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is integral to disc <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is connected to driving shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A weft yarn F coming from the reel (not shown) runs through the hollow shaft and arm. Disc <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> swivels to wind the yarn onto cylinder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to form a weft reserve RT comprising a plurality of loops of yarn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At each stroke of the loom, a number of n loops of yarn are unwound from the cylinder, matching the length L of weft inserted by the loom in the stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The number of loops which are unwound is counted, in a way known per se, by a photo-electric sensor and a pulse counter (not shown). The latter, when the penultimate loop (n&minus;1) is reached, causes an electrically controlled yarn-blocking device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be energized. This device is provided with a stop finger <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which, by dropping in a radial direction, enters a corresponding seat of the underlying cylinder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby blocking the unwinding of yarn F when the n-th (last) loop is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; controlling device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a modulated braking device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (or weft brake) are arranged downstream of stop device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, between supplier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and loom T. Weft yarn F passes through both devices and reaches the main nozzle UP of the loom, to which the operating fluid of the loom is supplied by a source S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The structure of weft brake <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is outside the scope of the invention. In the example shown, the brake is of the type described in the prior European Patent Application mentioned above and is preceded by a terminal yarn-guide eyelet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, coupled to the brake and arranged in a way known per se, for threading the brake pneumatically. To that purpose, eyelet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with an air supplying conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> opening in the cavity of the eyelet in such a direction as to generate an air flow having a motion component in the running direction of yarn F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the above air stream is used not only for pneumatically threading brake <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but also for subjecting the yarn to a continuous mechanical tensioning, applied to the yarn by the air stream, which, surprisingly, prevents the slackening of the loops on cylinder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when brake finger <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is operated&mdash;independently of the nature and count of the yarn as well as of the efficiency of brake <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To this purpose, conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to a circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which delivers pressurized air generated by a source S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Source S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a first and a second circuit branch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which are connected in parallel to source S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively. A pushbutton-operated solenoid valve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected in the first circuit branch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which, by manual control, supplies to conduit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the air causing the pneumatic threading of weft brake <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At least one flow regulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and preferably a solenoid valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> arranged in series with regulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are connected in the second circuit branch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Flow regulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is preferably driven by a motor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> controlled by processor &mgr;P which also controls supplier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, has the task of optimizing the dynamic performance (speed, flow rate) of the air stream which imparts the continuous mechanical tensioning to yarn F, and of reducing the air consumption, e.g. by repeatedly opening and shutting the regulator in succession. Solenoid valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is advantageous but not indispensable, operates together with regulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> essentially to eliminate or at least reduce the flow rate transients caused by the intermittent operation of the regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The structure of the device described above is particularly efficient and economic because it utilizes the pre-existent pneumatic threading circuit, but it is not limitative for the scope of the invention, because the pneumatic generator of the mechanical tensioning of the yarn may be designed as an autonomous unit, independent of the threading circuit, e.g. where this is not already provided in supplier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, within the teachings of the invention, the details of implementation and the embodiments can be changed extensively with respect to what has been described and illustrated by way of non limitative example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The disclosures in Italian Patent Application No. T02001A000569 from which this application claims priority are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
