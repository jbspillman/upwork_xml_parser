<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for fabricating semiconductor circuits containing both DRAM and logic cells. In particular, the invention relates to fabricating semiconductor circuits containing vertical pass gate embedded DRAM (EDRAM) arrays and dual workfunction logic gates. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With the advent of Large Scale Integration (LSI), many integrated circuit designs include several circuit functions on a single semiconductor substrate, such as memory storage and logic functions for addressing and accessing the memory. In the case where a logic region and a DRAM cell (memory) region are formed on the same substrate, the circuitry is commonly referred to as an embedded DRAM. The integration of logic and memory regions improves overall device performance by decreasing communication delays between memory devices on one chip and logic devices located on a second chip. In addition to the improvements in device performance, processing costs for integrating memory and logic circuit functions on the same semiconductor substrate potentially could be reduced due to the sharing of specific processing steps used to fabricate both types of devices. Present trends in DRAM technology are driving towards continued scaling of minimum feature size (F) in the DRAM array, and more compact cell layouts (e.g., 7F<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 6F<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, etc.). As a result, the above noted problems in the prior art become even more problematic, especially for devices where F&equals;100 nm and smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> DRAM circuits will usually include an array of memory cells interconnected by rows and columns, which are known as wordlines and bitlines, respectively. Reading data from, or writing data to the memory cells is achieved by activating selected wordlines and bitlines. Typically, the DRAM memory cell comprises a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) connected to a capacitor. The MOSFET generally includes a gate region and diffusion regions. The diffusion regions, depending on the operation of the transistor, are often referred to as either drain or source regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are different types of MOSFETs. Trench-gated MOSFETs are a class of MOSFETs in which the gate is positioned in a trench that is formed at the surface and extends into the silicon. The gate is formed in a lattice-like geometric pattern which defines individual cells of the DRAM; the pattern normally taking the form of closed polygons (squares, hexagons, etc.) or a series of interdigitated stripes or rectangles. The current flows in vertical channels which are formed adjacent to the sides of the trenches. The trenches are filled with a conductive gate material, typically doped polysilicon, which is insulated from the silicon by a dielectric layer normally consisting of silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The trench-gated MOSFETs are normally formed by etching trenches of various dimensions into a silicon substrate. The gate trenches normally extend into the substrate and are frequently rectangular, with flat bottoms bounded by corners. Trenches commonly contain storage capacitors below the MOSFETs and have N&plus; doped polysilicon as one plate of the capacitor (a storage node). The other plate of the capacitor is formed usually by diffusing N&plus; dopants out from a dopant source into a portion of the substrate surrounding the lower part of the trench. Between these two plates a dielectric layer is placed which thereby forms the capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typically, isolation regions are formed in the substrate to prevent carriers from traveling through the substrate between adjacent devices. The isolation regions are generally thick field oxide regions extending below the surface of the semiconductor substrate. One such technique for forming the isolation region is the local oxidation of silicon, i.e., LOCOS regions. LOCOS field oxidation regions are formed by first depositing a layer of silicon nitride on the substrate surface and then selectively etching a portion of the silicon nitride layer to form a mask exposing the substrate where the field oxidation will be formed. The masked substrate is then placed in an oxidation environment and a thick layer of oxide is selectively grown in the exposed mask regions forming an oxide layer extending above and below the substrate surface. An preferred alternative to LOCOS field oxidation is the formation of shallow trench isolation regions in contemporary CMOS technology, commonly referred to by those in the art as an STI region. In the process of forming the STI regions, a deep trench is formed in the semiconductor substrate by, for example, anisotropic etching. The trench is then filled with oxide back to the surface of the substrate to provide an isolation region between adjacent devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a typical DRAM array, the wordlines need to be capped with an insulator to allow formation of borderless diffusion contacts, whereas in the logic supports the gate conductors must be exposed to allow the introduction of dual workfunction doping and silicidation. Silicided gates and source/drain regions greatly complicate the processes for forming array MOSFETs since the array MOSFETs need bitline contacts which are borderless to adjacent wordline conductors. In addition, it has been found that silicide junctions in the array frequently result in increased current leakage of the memory device. Conventional solutions to these integration problems require additional masking steps to remove the insulating gate cap from the support MOSFETs prior to the silicidation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Problems encountered in the formation of vertical pass gate embedded DRAM (EDRAM) arrays and dual workfunction logic gates include the lithography steps used to simultaneously form the support gates and wordlines. The wordlines used in the array have tight pitch requirements whereas the support regions have relatively relaxed pitch features. Lithographic patterning these different pitches typically requires complex solutions, such as alternating phase shift masking techniques and the like, to overcome these difficulties. It is desirable to have the pitch requirements for the array and supports be similar or more relaxed to overcome these well known lithographic problems. However, this is not currently feasible as circuitry density increases and as such, common practice is to separately pattern the array and supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another problem with prior art processes is in the formation of the local interconnects. Conventionally, one of the metallization layers is used for forming both the bitline and the local interconnects. It is preferred to have a simpler process that eliminates the metallization layer and its attendant processing to form the local interconnect and metal layer. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/725,412 to Mandelman et al. filed on Nov. 29, 2000 shows how to form dual work function logic gates with vertical DRAM cells using a raised shallow trench isolation (RSTI) process. This process has the disadvantage that the support logic devices are subject to the thermal processes of the shallow trench isolation which can degrade the well profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/706,492 to Mandelman et al. filed on Nov. 3, 2000 overcomes many of the above noted thermal problems. The process disclosed therein generally includes a) patterning only the array gate wiring for the vertical transistors; b) forming silicided bitlines and peripheral transistors concurrently and c) showing a metal to form local interconnects. However, this methodology becomes difficult to implement for tight array pitches patterned with 193 nm lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for improved processes that address these concerns and provide a process that can be used for the more compact cell layouts. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a process for fabricating a vertical embedded DRAM array and dual workfunction support devices on a semiconductor substrate. The process, in accordance with the present invention, advantageously eliminates numerous processing steps relative to conventional fabrication. A metallization layer is commonly used for forming both the bitline and the local interconnects. This metal layer is commonly referred to as the M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> layer. In the present process, the local interconnects and bitlines are both silicided, thereby eliminating the need for the M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> metal layer as well as numerous process steps typically required to form the metal layer. Moreover, the silicidation of the bitlines (especially advantageous for sub 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>cells) relaxes the pitch requirement needed to form the first metal layer since the M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> metal layer generally has the tightest pitch requirements and presents the greatest photolithographic challenges. The use of relaxed pitches for the metal layers advantageously minimizes the well known difficulties associated with conventional lithographic patterning of dense (memory type) and isolated (logic type) features within the same layer. As a result, proximity effects during lithographic processing are minimized. Consequently, reliance on complicated optical proximity correction schemes, alternating phase shift masking techniques and the like is reduced significantly since formation of the first metal layer (i.e., M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> layer) is no longer required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are schematic, cross-sectional diagrams used to depict steps in an embodiment for fabricating a vertical embedded DRAM and logic support on the same substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the illustrated integrated circuit, generally designated as reference number <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is a suitable substrate for practicing the present invention. The integrated circuit includes a memory circuit region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a logic circuit region <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, wherein the memory circuit region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the logic circuit region <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are separated by an isolation region <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Although the drawings depict the isolation region as a shallow trench isolation (STI) region, the invention is not to be construed as being limited to STI regions. Suitable semiconductor substrates include, but are not limited to, Si, SiGe, Si/SiGe, silicon-on-insulators (SOI) and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the drawings illustrate only one of each region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the structure. In practice, depending on the design, the substrate may include numerous memory and support regions. Standard processing known in the art for fabricating vertical MOSFET DRAMs in the substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is applied through the step of defining an active area and after shallow trench isolation planarization. These standard processing techniques include formation of the storage capacitors in deep trenches, depositing a top oxide layer (TTO) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, forming array well implants, forming an implant for bitline diffusion region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for connecting adjacent vertical DRAMs, removing the original pad structure, and growing a vertical gate oxide layer and a gate conductor layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The array gate polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is separated from an underlying deep trench polysilicon region <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by a trench top oxide layer <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The bitline diffusion region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> between adjacent vertical DRAM cells and serves to electrically connect the bitline contact of the DRAM cells shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Also included are a collar region <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and a buried strap <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the exact memory structure shown in the figures. The DRAM cells may also include a buried exterior counter-electrode about the trench, or a counter-electrode formed inside the trench and a node dielectric formed on the counter-electrode. Deep trench polysilicon is formed on the node dielectric. Other memory structures which include the basic elements shown, but having different configurations are also contemplated herein. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the structure of a particular sub-8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>cell, but the invention may be modified for other sub-8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>cells or for an 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>vertical pass gate DRAM cell as will be discussed in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A block mask is used to selectively etch the TTO layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the support region <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and polysilicon <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is then deposited therein (after the support implants and support gate oxidation). The gate oxide layer is formed by recognized procedures and is shown as reference numeral <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is subsequently etched using a mask from the array region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the top oxide layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and polysilicon <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> are approximately the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The dual workfunction implants may be performed at this time in the support polysilicon using conventional photolithographic processing. Depending on the particular desired circuitry, the gates in the support region can be defined as either a P channel (PFET device) or as an N channel (NFET device). In the case of PFET devices, selective implantation of boron dopant ions is preferably performed in the polysilicon <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the support regions, whereas in NFET devices, selective implantation of arsenic or phosphorous ions is preferably employed. The energies, doses and selective processing required for each channel type are conventional and well within the skill of those in the art. The ion implantation of NFET supports may also be used for doping the polysilicon gates in the DRAM region. In contrast, during definition of the PFET logic gate structures, the DRAM region is protected by a layer of photoresist. Residual photoresist after processing each type of channel is removed with conventional plasma ashing and subsequent wet cleans as is known to those skilled in the art. A rapid thermal anneal (RTA) procedure can then be used to activate all of the doped regions or alternatively, the RTA procedure can be performed during subsequent processing of the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the memory structure after various layers have been formed in the support and array regions. The support polysilicon <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is separated from the underlying surface by the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. A barrier layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is deposited onto the array and support surfaces using conventional deposition processes such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma assisted CVD, sputtering and the like. Preferably, the barrier layer is formed from a metallic nitride composition. Nitrides suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride and the like. Other materials suitable for use as barrier layers will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this disclosure. The thickness of the barrier layer may vary and is not critical to the present invention. Optionally, a thin silicon layer may be sputtered (or deposited) to help with adhesion of the barrier layer to the top oxide layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A metal conductor layer <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, preferably a tungsten silicide (WSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>)/tungsten (W) layer, is next deposited utilizing one of the conventional deposition processes described above. The metal conductor layer <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is used to form the wordline stack in the array region. It should be noted that the process is not limited to this particular wordline structure. The thickness of the conductor may vary depending on the deposition process. The metal conductor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is capped with a thick layer of dielectric material <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) or silicon nitride or TEOS with a thin layer of silicon nitride (SiN) on top (not shown). The deposited dielectric layer <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> forms an insulating cap over the wordline conductors. Preferably, the dielectric material <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is a TEOS layer with a thin layer of about 10-30 nm of SiN on its upper surface. Then, using conventional lithography and etching processes, the gate stacks in the support region <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are patterned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At the time of patterning the array wordlines, the stack thickness in both the array and support regions are approximately coplanar. The support logic gates are first patterned and etched to the gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> using conventional processes. At this point, gate sidewall oxidation layers <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> are grown on the sidewalls of the gate stacks, followed by deposition of a thin dielectric layer <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> onto the substrate. Preferably, the dielectric layer is silicon nitride at a thickness of about 10 nm. The support extension implants <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> are performed and an insulating layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of TEOS is deposited onto the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate the memory and support regions after defining the memory and support stacks. The array wordlines are patterned and etched. The support regions are protected by oxide layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. A resist mask is then applied and exposed in the array and in regions where a local interconnect <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is to be formed. The top oxide layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is removed in the array region selective to the top of the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. The oxide and dielectric layers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> respectively, are also removed in regions where the local interconnect <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is to be formed. For example, portions of the top oxide layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) are removed over the bitline diffusion regions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in the array region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In addition, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is selectively removed to expose the (n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) interconnect regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Silicon nitride spacers <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are then formed on the sidewalls of the memory stacks in the array region. A second layer of n&plus; doped polysilicon <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is conformally deposited over the substrate and planarized to a level above the gate stack. Polishing may be used to planarize the doped polysilicon surface and is accomplished by conventional chemical mechanical polishing techniques known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A hardmask, such as boron silicate glass (BSG) phosphorous silicate glass (PSG), arsenic silicate glass (ASG) or the like may then be applied and the second layer of polysilicon <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is patterned with a photoresist mask and selectively etched to the STI oxide <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> in the array, selectively etched to the dielectric layer in the interconnect region, and completely removed from the support regions. If a hardmask is utilized, it is then stripped selective to the substrate. If needed, an additional oxide layer, such as TEOS, is then deposited and spacers <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> etched. These additional spacers form on the sides of the bitline and local interconnect. The nitride <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is then etched. The deep n&plus; and p&plus; implants <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> are performed while masking the PFETs and NFETs respectively. The outdiffused n-type dopant forms n&plus; junctions <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in regions of the local interconnects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Silicide regions <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> are then formed on surfaces of the exposed polysilicon <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the silicide regions are formed on the array bitline diffusion region, the interconnects and the support source/drain region. A rapid thermal anneal procedure or the like is used to form the silicide regions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the resulting structure with the silcided regions <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that selective silicidation of the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the support source/drain regions eliminates the need for an M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> metal layer for sub-8F<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>cells <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is intentionally showing a different interconnect as would be expected from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to show the different structures possible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows silicided junctions and a silicided interconnect separate from the junctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Standard processing then continues to form the various wiring levels, vias and interlevel dielectric layers. For example, an interlevel dielectric layer may be deposited on the structure, patterned and etched to form vias or the like in the interlevel dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, preferably used for the fabrication of 8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>vertical DRAM cells, the SiN spacer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is selectively etched in regions where the bitline contact is to be made in the manner shown in the top down view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and corresponding cross-sectional view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. In this process, the spacer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is not etched in the same active array regions (AA<highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight>) between adjacent wordlines (WL<highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight>) where the bitlines are not contacted. The hatched regions show the regions where the SiN spacer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is etched. This allows the bitline diffusion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to be exposed only in the hatched region. It is important to note that the wordline is isolated from the substrate by the top oxide <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and is shorted by the bitline diffusion region <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The deposited polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is then patterned as a landing pad resulting in the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. The landing pads are patterned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> by the hatched region. Optionally, the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may require a CMP planarization and subsequent hardmask as discussed in the previous embodiment. These polysilicon landing pads are then silicided and electrically connected with a subsequent metal wiring level by means of a metal contact. In this embodiment, the metal wiring level serves as the bitline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a barrier layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a conductor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> are deposited onto the structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As previously described, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is preferably a combination of TEOS and a thin layer of silicon nitride. The array gate is patterned and etched to the TTO layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is then deposited. A mask is used to selectively etch the silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in the non-array portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the wafer. The TTO layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is then removed in the non-array portions and a support sacrificial oxide layer (not shown) is thermally grown. During these process steps, the array regions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are protected by the silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The support implants (wells and threshold adjust) are performed, the sacrificial oxide layer is stripped and the support gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is grown as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> layer of intrinsic polysilicon <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is deposited onto the substrate and patterned with the support gate conductor mask. Optionally, a hard mask may be used for this part of the process. The polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is then etched to the gate oxide <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in the support regions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and completely cleared selective to the gate cap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in the array region. The support extension and halo implants are performed after an optional sidewall oxidation. The PFET implants may be performed after an optional SiN spacer layer is formed (not shown). A barrier nitride layer <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is then deposited onto the substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Subsequently, a TEOS liner layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is then deposited onto the substrate and removed in the array and in the regions where the local interconnect is to be formed. The TEOS liner is removed by using a photoresist mask and conventional wet etching processes. Then, the SIN layer is removed by exposing the layer to RIE and etching the TTO <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the array with a RIE selective to the silicon <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> underlying the array region and the interconnect region. The resist used for the mask is then selectively stripped from the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The etching of the nitride layers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> forms the spacer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in the array regions. A layer of n&plus; doped polysilicon <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is conformally deposited and planarized over the gate stack. An optional BSG hardmask (used for planarization reasons) is used to pattern the n&plus; doped polysilicon (with a photoresist mask) and the bitlines and local interconnects are defined. Once the BSG is stripped, an additional TEOS layer may be deposited and spacers <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> etched. The nitride in the support gate regions are then etched, the n&plus; and p&plus; implants are performed which also dopes the gate stack <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The gate stack <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the n&plus; interconnect and the n&plus; poly bitline are then silicided. The complete structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The rest of the process follows conventional process steps as is recognized by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to the foregoing, the advantages of the invention include at least the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 1. Separate lithography requirements for the array region advantageously results in a more robust photolithography process window. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the difficulties encountered in photolithographic patterning of memory features and logic support features within the same layer and the resulting advantages by separately patterning the significantly different pitch requirements for the memory and logic regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 2. A conventional first metal layer, commonly referred to as the M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> layer, is not required for sub-8F<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>cells since the bitlines and local interconnects are formed by the salicidation of polysilicon. Elimination of the M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> layer removes the most difficult layer to photolithographically pattern. The M<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> layer typically includes features of the smallest dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and variations of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing disclosure. Therefore, it is to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention can be practiced otherwise than has been specifically shown and described. </paragraph>
