<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to optical devices coupled to optical fibers, and particularly to optical fiber-coupled devices that can be formed in large numbers using wafer-level techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Optical fibers have by far the greatest transmission bandwidth of any conventional transmission medium, and therefore optical fibers provide an excellent transmission medium. An optical fiber is a thin filament of drawn or extruded glass or plastic having a central core and a surrounding cladding of lower index material to promote internal reflection. Optical radiation (i.e. light) is coupled (i.e. launched) into the end face of an optical fiber by focusing the light onto the core. For effective coupling, light must be directed within a cone of acceptance angle and inside the core of an optical fiber. Because any optical radiation outside the core or acceptance angle will not be effectively coupled into the optical fiber, it is important to precisely align the core with an external source of optical radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A fiber optic coupler for coupling optical radiation between an optical device and an optical fiber is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,482 B1, issued Dec. 11, 2001, entitled MULTILAYER OPTICAL FIBER COUPLER, which is incorporated by reference herein. The &apos;482 patent discloses, inter alia, a multiplayer optical fiber coupler that includes a first layer that defines a fiber socket in which an optical fiber is situated, and a second layer coupled to the first layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be an advantage to provide optical fiber-coupled devices that provide functions such as filters, switches, and multiplexers/demultiplexers, and in which the optical fiber is integrated into the optical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Conventional optical devices generally require costly and time-consuming alignment steps to ensure efficient coupling to optical fibers. For example, one conventional practice for making a fiber-pigtailed transmitter is to assemble an edge-emitting laser diode, an electronics circuit, a focusing lens, and a length of optical fiber and then manually align each individual transmitter. To align the transmitter, the diode is turned on and the optical fiber is manually adjusted until the coupled light inside the fiber reaches a predetermined level. Then, the optical fiber is permanently affixed by procedures such as UV-setting epoxy or laser welding. This manual assembly procedure is time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. Up to 80% of the manufacturing cost of a fiber-pigtailed module can be due to the fiber alignment step. The high cost of aligning optical fiber presents a large technological barrier to cost reduction and widespread deployment of optical fiber modules. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Integrated optical devices are disclosed herein in which one or more optical fibers are vertically integrated with other optical components in a multilayer arrangement. Particularly, the integrated devices include one or more optical fibers inserted into a fiber socket in fiber socket layer, and other optical components vertically integrated into one or more layers aligned with, and attached to the optical fiber socket layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a vertically integrated optical device comprises a fiber socket layer comprising a plurality of sockets including a first socket and second socket arranged proximate to each other. A first optical fiber is situated in the first socket and a second optical fiber situated in the second socket. A plurality of component layers are coupled to the fiber socket layer including a first component layer that includes a first optical component and a second component layer that includes a second optical component. The first optical fiber is arranged for optical coupling with the second optical fiber via the first and second optical components. The first optical component may comprise a lens that defines a central axis, and the first and second optical fibers are aligned offset from the central axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Optical components that may be included in the structure include an actuable mirror that provides a variable optical attenuator device. The mirror may be partially transparent, and the device may further comprise a photodetector situated opposite the mirror from the optical fibers. Other optical components include an etalon, either passive or actuable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A component layer may comprise a spacer layer that provides a predetermined opening that is hermetically sealed to protect sensitive components, such as MEMS devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The device may comprise a second fiber socket layer on the structure opposite the first fiber socket layer, which has one or more optical fibers situated therein that may be optically coupled to the optical fibers in the first socket layer. In one embodiment, a first optical component comprises a first lens that defines a central axis, and first and second optical fibers in the first layer are aligned offset from the central axis, and a second optical component comprises a second lens that defines a second central axis, and a third optical fiber in the second layer is aligned offset from the central axis. A dielectric (e.g. WDM) filter may situated between the first and second lenses, the WDM filter arranged so that an input beam from the first optical fiber interacts with the WDM filter, thereby separating the input beam into a reflected beam that is coupled into the second optical fiber and a transmitted beam that is coupled into the third optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also, a method of forming a socket layer for holding a plurality of optical fiber is disclosed, comprising forming a first mask on a first surface of a wafer, the first mask defining a pattern including a first plurality of socket openings, forming a second mask on a second, opposing surface of the wafer, the second mask including a second plurality of socket openings aligned with the first plurality of socket holes. The exposed first surface is etched to between about one-half the thickness of the wafer and the full thickness of the wafer, and then the second surface is etched through the other side to provide a socket between the socket openings in the first and second masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additionally, an integrated laser device is disclosed comprising a fiber socket layer including a fiber socket, an optical fiber situated in the fiber socket, a first component layer connected to the socket layer, the first component layer comprising a microlens. A laser layer that comprises a semiconductor material is connected to the first component layer, including a laser facet formed on a surface of the laser layer, a turning mirror formed on the surface, and an in-plane waveguide defined between the laser facet and turning mirror. A partial reflector is situated proximate to the optical fiber, the partial reflector and the laser facet defining a laser cavity. The turning mirror may comprise an etched mirror that is approximately 45&deg; to the surface, thereby providing a 90&deg; turning mirror. An etalon, passive or actuable, may be situated within the laser cavity.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Overview </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram that generally illustrates steps for making a vertically integrated device as described herein. First and second socket wafers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are formed with a plurality of fiber sockets shown generally at <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that are created to hold optical fibers. First, second, and third component wafers <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, which can include a variety of optical devices, are situated between the first and second socket wafers. The socket wafers and the component wafers are bonded to provide a wafer stack shown generally at <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for device integration in the wafer surface-normal (vertical) direction, in contrast to conventional planar waveguide technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Once the wafer stack has been created, the individual devices on the wafer structure are then broken out by appropriate processes such as &ldquo;slice and dice&rdquo; along a grid pattern <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. One device is shown at <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> after being been broken off from the wafer stack. The optical fibers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are then inserted into the sockets in the device <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. This technology is generally referred to herein as &ldquo;vertical fiber integration (&ldquo;VFI&rdquo;) technology. Advantageously, the VFI devices are manufacturable in large batches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/327,826, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,482 B1, entitled &ldquo;Multilayer Optical Fiber Coupler&rdquo;, incorporated by reference herein, discloses a multiplayer structure that includes fiber socket technology to align an optical fiber with other optical components situated on other layers. The fiber socket technology disclosed in the &apos;482 patent is utilized herein in a variety of configurations, with multiple component layers to make ultra-low cost optical fiber components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A variety of devices are disclosed herein as examples that can be implemented using vertical fiber integration technology, including passive optical devices and active optical devices. The passive devices include add/drop filters, and wavelength division multiplexers/demultiplexers, variable optical attenuators, fiber optic switches, and tunable filters. Active devices include fiber optic receivers, laser transmitters and wavelength tunable lasers. Using this technology and these examples, a wide variety of devices can be implemented. In addition to those techniques, additional techniques may be useful such as a wafer level hermetic sealing process disclosed herein, which is useful for the VOA device and any other application that requires space between one layer and another. To illustrate one fabrication process, steps for making the add/drop filter device will be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>M; it should be apparent that the other devices described herein could be implemented using similar techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Add/Drop Filter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An add/drop filter is a fiber optic device that separates a multi-wavelength input beam into two separate output beams with different wavelengths. Conventionally, add/drop filters may be constructed by using a WDM thin film dielectric filter situated between two collimators. One collimator has two fiber pigtails, one of the pigtails providing the input beam and the other pigtail receiving the beam reflected from the dielectric (e.g. WDM) filter. The other collimator has one fiber pigtail that receives the beam transmitted through the WDM filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a three port, integrated optical fiber filter structure that includes five layers aligned and bonded together, including a first fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and a second fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that have vertical sockets extending therethrough, dimensioned for receiving the optical fibers. The socket layer comprises any suitable material, such as silicon. As will be described, the sockets are arranged in a predetermined alignment with respect to other optical components in the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Component layers <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are situated between the first and second fiber socket layers. The first component layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> includes a first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that has its focal plane proximate to the interface between the first fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The third component layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> includes a second microlens <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that has its focal plane proximate to the interface between the second fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the third component layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the microlenses comprise refractive elements. The second component layer has a dielectric thin film coating <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> on one surface to provide a WDM filter. The component layers comprise any suitable material such as glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The first fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> comprises a first fiber socket <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> that receives a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and a second fiber socket <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> proximate thereto that receives a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The second fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> comprises a third fiber socket <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> that receives a third optical fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. The optical fibers <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> are permanently affixed inside their fiber sockets by optical epoxy <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. The optical fibers <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> typically comprise single mode fibers such as used for telecommunications purposes; however, other optical fibers, such as multimode fibers, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The optical fibers are arranged within their respective sockets so that their ends are proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the component layer. The first and second microlenses are positioned within the structure so that their focal planes are proximate to respective interfaces between the component layer and the socket layer, and therefore the focal planes approximately coincide with the ends of the respective optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is a well known property of geometrical optics that a beam of light originating from a point on the focal plane is collimated by the lens into a parallel beam of light. If the point is on-axis, the output beam is parallel to the optical axis. If the point is off-axis, the output beam is at an angle to the lens&apos; optical axis. This property is used in the design of the integrated optical fiber filter herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The sockets are formed with respect to the microlenses so that the optical fibers are off-axis. Particularly, the first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> defines a first central optical axis <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the first and the second fibers <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the cores of the first and second fibers are positioned on opposite sides of the first central axis <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and approximately equidistant therefrom so that light exiting from the first fiber <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and reflecting from the WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is coupled into the second fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The second microlens <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> defines a second central optical axis <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the third fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In one example, the first fiber <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> is the input fiber, the second fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is a reflected output fiber, and the third fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is a transmitted output fiber. The fiber sockets, microlenses, and WDM filter are all arranged so that input light entering the input fiber is collimated by the first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to form an approximately parallel beam with a finite beam angle with respect to the first central axis <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, due to the off-axis arrangement of the optical fiber. The light beam impinges on the multi-layer WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the light beam then is split into reflected light and transmitted light depending on the spectral property of the thin film filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The reflected light beam is tilted back to surface normal direction by the first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and coupled into the core of the reflected output fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The transmitted light beam from the WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is focused by the second microlens <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> into the core of the transmitted fiber. Again the off-axis arrangement of the second microlens <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> with respect to the fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> tilts the angled beam back to surface normal direction before coupling it into the transmitted output fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The dielectric filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can take many forms. The variety of dielectric thin film filters makes the add/drop filter disclosed herein a very useful structure that can be used in a number of applications by choosing a different filter. Possible devices that can be made using this structure include an add/drop WDM filter, a 1480 nm/1550 nm pump coupler or a 980 nm/1550 nm pump coupler, a fiber tap coupler, and/or a 1&times;2 beam splitter. A wide variety of filters are possible, such as a broadband filter, a narrow band filter, a high pass or a low pass filter, and an amplified spontaneous emission noise rejection filter. This filter can be a simple beam splitter coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is cross-section of alternative embodiment to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> that comprises a four port fiber filter structure that can be used as a 2&times;2 fiber coupler. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes, in addition to the elements described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an additional layer <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, that positions the WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> approximately midway between the first and second microlenses <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. However, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the first and second axes are approximately aligned, rather than being offset. A fourth fiber socket <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is provided in the second socket layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and a fourth fiber <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> is situated therein. The fourth fiber socket <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> situates the fourth fiber <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> offset from the second axis <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Particularly, the fourth fiber socket <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> positions the fourth fiber <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of the second axis <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> from the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. The third and fourth fibers are approximately equidistant from the second axis <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>; i.e. the second axis <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is approximately midway between the third and fourth fibers. In operation, the 2&times;2 coupler of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> utilizes the fourth fiber <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> to receive a second input, the third fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> receives a second reflected output in addition to the first transmitted output, and the second fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> receives a second transmitted output in addition to the first reflected output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a two-port (in-line) fiber 1&times;1 filter, which is a modification of the 1&times;2 filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The 1&times;1 design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> eliminates the reflected output fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and provides a single transmitted output on the output fiber <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, which may be cost effective in applications where only a single output is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is a cross-section of a portion of a double-side polished silicon substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. A SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>etch mask <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is deposited on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the thickness of the silicon wafer is about 500 &mgr;m, and the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is deposited to a thickness of around 10 &mgr;m. The SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> has a fiber socket pattern <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> that defines a plurality of fiber sockets. In one embodiment the diameter of the fiber sockets is about 126 &mgr;m in diameter, which will accommodate standard single mode optical fibers. One method of making the fiber sockets using a two-sided etch hole is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> with two fiber sockets <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> formed therein, and the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask stripped. The fiber sockets are precision vertical holes etched all the way through the silicon substrate. This process creates the first and second socket layers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The fiber sockets <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are formed by a process such as dry etching using a deep silicon etch process, such as the Bosch process using a deep RIE etcher, for example. The &apos;482 patent, incorporated by reference, also discloses methods for forming the sockets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> is a cross-section of a glass wafer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (e.g. fused silica) that will be formed into a component layer with a microlens component. A high selectivity hard mask <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> is deposited on the glass wafer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and photolithographically patterned into a pattern that includes an exposed section <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> that has a shape to allow creation of a recessed microlens, as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, the photoresist is deposited onto the wafer assembly and photolithographically patterned into a pattern for microlens fabrication. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> shows the wafer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> after photoresist <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> has been spun thereon in a pattern that creates a cylinder <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> of photoresist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>E, the photoresist is reflowed to form a spherical surface <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> on the photoresist. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference> shows the photoresist cylinder <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> after being reshaped by melting the photoresist in an oven. The surface tension of the melted photoresist creates a spherical surface, which will to act as an etch mask for creating microlenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>F, the spherical surface is transferred to glass using a dry etcher. Particularly, the glass wafer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is etched using the reflow photoresist/hard mask combination as mask layers to form a microlens <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference> shows the resulting microlens <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> after the photoresist is completely etched away and the spherical surface is transferred onto the glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>G, the hard mask <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> is stripped in a suitable environment. An anti-reflection (AR) coating <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> may be deposited on the surface of the microlens <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The process described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>G is used to create the microlenses on the component layers such as the first and third component layers <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H, a</cross-reference> glass wafer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> with a suitable wafer thickness and surface smoothness is provided for forming a dielectric (e.g. WDM) filter thereon. The qualities and dimensions of the glass wafer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are determined by the requirements of the final structure. For example, depending on the application, the material in the glass wafer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> can be a low thermal expansion coefficient glass or fused silica glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I, a</cross-reference> suitable dielectric thin film filter coating <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is deposited on one side of the glass wafer <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> to provide a WDM filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>J, the glass wafer <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is aligned and bonded to the bottom microlens layer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>K, the two-wafer stack from the previous step (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</cross-reference>) is aligned and bonded to the top microlens layer <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to create a three wafer stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>L, the three-wafer stack from the previous step (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</cross-reference>) is aligned and bonded to a top socket layer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to create four-wafer stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>M, the four-wafer stack from the previous step (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</cross-reference>) is aligned and bonded to a bottom socket layer <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to create the final five-wafer stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This creates the finished filter structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: particularly the top and bottom socket layers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>correspond to the first and second socket layers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the top and bottom microlens layers <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>correspond to the first and third component layers <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and the glass wafer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (with the dielectric coating) corresponds to the second component layer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The finished wafer stack is further diced up into chips. Optical fibers are inserted into the fiber sockets with a small amount of epoxy to permanently fix the fiber inside the fiber socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Wavelength Division Multiplexer and Demultiplexer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Currently wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is causing a revolution in optical fiber communications, since it is the most practical means for increasing the transmission capacity of installed optical fiber cables (e.g. up to 160 fold) without laying new fibers, simply by transmitting multiple wavelengths through the same optical fiber. In a WDM system, multiplexer devices multiplex any number of optical wavelengths into a single fiber at the transmitting end. At the receiving end of the fiber, demultiplexers separate the single beam into its constituent wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a multi-channel WDM demultiplexer, which can also be used as a multiplexer by reversing the inputs and outputs. The embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes a first socket layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and a second socket layer <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> that have a plurality of sockets extending therethrough, and first, second, and third component layers <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> situated between the first and second socket layers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The socket layers <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> comprise any suitable material such as silicon, and the component layers comprise any suitable material such as glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The first and second socket layers include a plurality of sockets formed in a predetermined alignment with respect to the other optical components in the structure. The first socket layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> comprises a first socket <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> that receives a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight>, a third socket <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight> that receives third optical fiber <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>, and a fifth socket <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> that receives a fifth optical fiber <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>, all arranged in a proximate relationship to each other. The second fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> comprises a second fiber socket <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> that receives a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>, a fourth fiber socket <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> that receives a fourth optical fiber <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, and a sixth socket <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> that receives a sixth optical fiber <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>, all arranged in a proximate relationship to each other. The optical fibers are arranged within their respective sockets so that their ends are proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the adjacent component layer. The optical fibers typically comprise single mode fibers such as used for telecommunications purposes; however, other optical fibers, such as multimode fibers, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The first and third component layers include a plurality of microlenses. Particularly, the first component layer <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> includes a first microlens <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, a third microlens <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, and a fifth microlens <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> whose focal planes are proximate to the interface between the first fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>. The third component layer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> includes a second microlens <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, a fourth microlens <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, and a sixth microlens <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> whose focal planes are proximate to the interface between the second fiber socket layer <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and the third component layer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight>. Because each of the optical fibers is arranged within its respective socket so that its end is proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the component layer, the focal planes of the microlenses approximately coincide with the ends of the respective optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Each of the sockets is aligned with respect to its respective microlens so that its optical fiber is off-axis from the central axes defined by the microlens. Particularly, the first microlens <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> defines a first central optical axis <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the first fibers <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight>. The second microlens <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> defines a second central optical axis <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the second fiber <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>. The third microlens <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> defines a third central optical axis <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the third fiber <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cores of the first and third fibers are positioned on opposite sides of the first and third central axes <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>653</bold></highlight>, and approximately equidistant therefrom so that light from the first fiber <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> reflecting from the dielectric (e.g. WDM) filter <highlight><bold>671</bold></highlight> is coupled into the third fiber <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>. The fourth microlens <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> defines a fourth central optical axis <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the fourth optical fiber <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, the fifth microlens <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> defines a fifth central optical axis <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the fifth optical fiber <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>, and the sixth microlens <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> defines a sixth central optical axis <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the sixth optical fiber <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The second component layer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> has a plurality of WDM filters formed on both an upper surface <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight> and a lower surface <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>, each having a different center wavelength to select (transmit) a particular predetermined wavelength signal. A first WDM filter <highlight><bold>671</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower surface proximate to the second microlens <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, a second WDM filter <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface proximate to the third microlens <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, a third WDM filter <highlight><bold>673</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower surface proximate to the fourth microlens <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, and a fourth WDM filter <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface proximate to the fifth microlens <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, four WDM filters are shown for purpose of illustration thereby providing four WDM output wavelengths (and a fifth output that includes all other wavelength(s) not transmitted by the four WDM filters). it should be apparent that the WDM filter/microlens/optical fiber operate as a unit, and that, in other embodiments, additional units can be added as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The WDM filters can take many forms including dielectric thin film coatings. The variety of dielectric thin film filters makes the WDM filter disclosed herein a very useful structure that can be used in a number of applications by choosing a different wavelength filter. For example, the WDM filters may comprise beamsplitter coatings, and in such an embodiment an array of 1&times;N beamsplitters can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In operation, the demultiplexer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> resembles the add/drop filter described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in optical principle except that there are several WDM filters with different center wavelengths on the same wafer, and light bounces up and down between the WDM filters until it is transmitted through one of the WDM filters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The first fiber <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> is the input fiber. After entering through the input fiber port, light near the center wavelength of the first WDM filter <highlight><bold>671</bold></highlight> is transmitted therethrough and coupled into the second optical fiber <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> to provides a single wavelength output. Any light not transmitted is reflected toward the second WDM filter <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight>, where it is either transmitted and coupled into the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>, or reflected to the third WDM filter <highlight><bold>673</bold></highlight>. In this manner, light bounces up and down between the WDM filters until, finally, all the remaining light exits from the structure coupled into the sixth optical fiber <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>. In summary, each time light hits a WDM filter, one wavelength is transmitted, as determined by the WDM filter, while the other wavelengths are reflected. This way, as the input beam reflects from WDM filter to WDM filter, a different wavelength is separated at each interaction with the WDM filter and coupled into a respective fiber. Furthermore, although the structure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is described as a demultiplexer with a single input and several single wavelength outputs, it could also be used as a multiplexer by reversing the inputs and outputs; i.e. providing single wavelength inputs to the second, third, fourth, fifth, and/or sixth fibers, and receiving a multiplexed output on the first fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing process for the WDM demultiplexer can be accomplished using the principles as described for example with reference to the add/drop filter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>M). One difference is that multiple WDM thin film filters with different center wavelengths are patterned on the same wafer. This task can be achieved using a patterned thin film filter process, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,464, entitled &ldquo;Striped Dichroic Filter and Method for Making the Same&rdquo;, which is incorporated by reference herein. In this process, a photolithographic liftoff mask is prepared before each thin film filter deposition. The liftoff mask patterns the thin film filter. For a multiple wavelength WDM demultiplexer, multiple thin film deposition and liftoff steps are performed to create the corresponding filters for each of the wavelengths. In principle this structure can be used to produce any WDM demultiplexer including dense WDM demultiplexers; however, it may be less costly to produce coarse WDM demultiplexers (e.g. demultiplexers with wide channel spacing) rather than DWDM (dense WDM) filters with narrow channel spacing (e.g. 100 GHz and 200 GHz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Due to the small size of the parallel optical beams (80 &mgr;m diameter typical), the beam widening at each subsequent reflection due to diffraction could become significant in some embodiments if there are more than eight consecutive dielectric filters. If this is the case, relay microlenses (not shown) may be incorporated into the two WDM filter surfaces to effectively collimate the light beam. The relay microlens structure can be made, for example, by bonding two WDM filter wafers, one of which has a relay microlens made on the back surface, so that the relay microlens is sandwiched in the middle between the two WDM filter wafers. Another function of the relay microlenses is to ensure that the light beams strike the WDM filter surfaces with a flat wave front, since the transmission of the WDM filter is sensitive to the incident angle. If the light beam does not strike the WDM surface with a flat wave front, it could cause crosstalk between different wavelength channels. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Due to the number of channels in WDM networks, and particularly due to the very large number of channels in DWDM networks, there is an urgent market need for variable optical attenuators (VOAs) that can be used to attenuate the optical power in a fiber. An array of the VOAs described herein can be used, for example, to adjust the input power of each of the input beams at each wavelength before multiplexing the beams together in a multiplexer such as discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> to illustrate a VOA that includes an active device (e.g. an actuable mirror) that can be controlled to vary the amount of light coupled out. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment that includes a socket layer <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> having a plurality of sockets extending therethrough, and first, second, and third component layers <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The socket layer comprises any suitable material such as silicon, and the component layers comprise any suitable material such as glass or silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The socket layer <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of sockets formed in a predetermined alignment with respect to the other optical components in the structure. Particularly, the socket layer <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> comprises a first socket <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> that receives a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> and a second socket <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> that receives a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight>. The optical fibers are arranged within their respective sockets so that their ends are proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the adjacent component layer. The optical fibers typically comprise single mode fibers such as used for telecommunications purposes; however, other optical fibers, such as multimode fibers, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The first component layer <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> includes a microlens <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> whose focal plane is proximate to the interface between the socket layer <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. Because each of the optical fibers is arranged within its respective socket so that its end is proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the component layer, the focal planes of the microlens approximately coincides with the ends of the first and second optical fibers <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Each of the first and second sockets <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> are aligned with respect to the microlens <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> so that the cores of the optical fibers are off-axis from a central axes <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight> defined by the microlens. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the cores of the first and second fibers are positioned on opposite sides of the first central axis <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> and approximately equidistant therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The third component layer <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> comprises a MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight> formed on the upper surface of the layer <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. The MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight>, which may be approximately centered on the optical axis <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight>, is formed in an opening <highlight><bold>762</bold></highlight> by any suitable technique, and in one embodiment the MEMS mirror comprises single crystal silicon, and the second and third component layers <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> comprises silicon. A VOA electrode <highlight><bold>763</bold></highlight> is provided on the upper surface of the layer <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> in electrical contact with the MEMS mirror. The VOA electrode <highlight><bold>763</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to a metal-plated hole <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> in the layer <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, such as a via hole or a deep-etched large through hole plated with metal. Therefore, an electrical control signal can be applied to the MEMS mirror through the bottom side of the device using the metal-plated hole <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> and the VOA electrode <highlight><bold>763</bold></highlight>. In operation, as voltage is applied to the VOA electrode <highlight><bold>763</bold></highlight>, the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight> is pulled down by the electrostatic force between the VOA electrode and the silicon wafer, which acts as the other electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> For description purposes the first fiber <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> provides an input beam <highlight><bold>771</bold></highlight>, and the second fiber receives a reflected beam <highlight><bold>772</bold></highlight> to provide an output, although the inputs and outputs could be reversed. In operation, the two fiber sockets <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> set the positions of the two fibers <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> offset from the optical axis <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight> of the microlens, and therefore the input beam <highlight><bold>771</bold></highlight> and the output optical beam <highlight><bold>772</bold></highlight> form approximately the same angle with the mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight> when the mirror is in a neutral position with no voltage applied. As a result, substantially all the optical power will be coupled into the output fiber <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> as long as the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight> is in the neutral position with no voltage applied. As voltage is increasingly applied to the VOA electrode, the MEMS mirror is pulled down by the electrostatic force between the VOA electrode and the silicon wafer, which acts as the other electrode, misaligning the reflected beam with the core of the output fiber. As misalignment increases the output light decreases in power as coupling efficiency drops. Eventually, the reflected beam will completely miss the output fiber thereby reducing output light power to about zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The second component layer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> provides an opening <highlight><bold>781</bold></highlight> between the microlens <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> and the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> may comprise silicon, and the opening <highlight><bold>781</bold></highlight> may be formed by a wafer-level process such as DRIE etching that creates a through hole in the wafer. When the component layers <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> are bonded together such as described elsewhere herein, the through holes become hermetically sealed and thus, the opening <highlight><bold>781</bold></highlight> is hermetically sealed. Some embodiment of MEMS fiber optic components require hermetic packaging in order to satisfy environmental requirements. By hermetically sealing the opening <highlight><bold>781</bold></highlight> where the MEMS mirror resides, the other parts of the VOA structure will not require hermetic packaging, which would be the conventional expensive hermetic packaging practice. As a result, very low cost device packaging can be employed. In one method, the component layers can be hermetically sealed by using ring shaped solder patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a cross-section of an alternative embodiment to the VOA of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Many of the elements are the same; however the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> additionally includes a photodetector section <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> provided in a third component layer <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. The photodetector <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> can be monitored to provide input power-level feedback so that a smart VOA device can be made at ultra-low cost. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> is constructed similar to the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>761</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> except that the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> is partially transparent so that a small percent of the input light beam <highlight><bold>771</bold></highlight>, as shown at <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight>, is transmitted through. The MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> may be made of single crystal silicon for improved reliability. </paragraph>

In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, third component layer <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> comprises a photodetector, such as InP. In some embodiments, the speed of the photodetector is not critical, which is one consideration in selecting a material. The third component layer <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> includes electrodes <highlight><bold>863</bold></highlight> formed on its upper surface and a metal-coated hole <highlight><bold>864</bold></highlight>, which provides an electrical connection to the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> and the photodetector. During operation, the photodetector is monitored to determine the power level of the input beam. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the second component layer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> includes the opening <highlight><bold>781</bold></highlight>, and wafer level hermetic packaging can be implemented to protect the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> at low cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The first and second socket layers <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> include a plurality of sockets formed in a predetermined alignment with respect to the other optical components in the structure. The first socket layer <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> comprises a first socket <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> that receives a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> and a second socket <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> that receives a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight>, arranged in a proximate relationship to each other. The second socket layer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> comprises a third fiber socket <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> that receives a third optical fiber <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> and a fourth socket <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> that receives a fourth optical fiber <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, arranged in a proximate relationship to each other. The optical fibers are arranged within their respective sockets so that their ends are proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the adjacent component layer. The optical fibers typically comprise single mode fibers such as used for telecommunications purposes; however, other optical fibers, such as multimode fibers, may be used in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The first and fourth component layers <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> each include a microlens, and may comprise a glass material. Particularly, the first component layer <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> includes a first microlens <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> whose focal plane is proximate to the interface between the first socket layer <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. The fourth component layer <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> includes a second microlens <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> whose focal plane is proximate to the interface between the second socket layer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and the fourth component layer <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. Because each of the optical fibers is arranged within its respective socket so that its end is proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the component layer, the focal planes of the microlenses approximately coincide with the ends of the respective optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Each of the sockets is aligned with respect to its respective microlens so that its optical fiber is off-axis from the central axes defined by the microlenses. Particularly, the first microlens <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> defines a first central optical axis <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the first and second fibers <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight>. The second microlens <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> defines a second central optical axis <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> that is offset from the core of the third and fourth fiber <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>944</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the first and second optical axes <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> are approximately aligned with each other, and have approximately the same optical power. Furthermore, the cores of the first and second fibers are positioned on opposite sides of the first central axis <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> and approximately equidistant therefrom, and likewise the cores of the third and fourth fibers are positioned on opposite sides of the second central axis <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>, and approximately equidistant therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> that is reflective on both sides is provided approximately equidistant between the first and second microlenses. The mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>, which may be approximately aligned with the optical axes <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>, is formed by any suitable technique. For example, the mirror can be made by conventional MEMS techniques and in one embodiment comprises single crystal silicon. The MEMS mirror provides two states (e.g. open and closed), and has any suitable configuration; for example it can be a sliding mirror or a torsion mirror. A sliding mirror has one advantage in that, in the event of a power loss, the sliding switch is latched on to the pre-power loss state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The spacing between the microlenses and the mirror is provided respectively by the second and third component layers <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, both of which may comprise silicon. In one embodiment the MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of the third layer <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. Each of the layers <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> has an opening to allow light to propagate from the microlens to the mirror; particularly, the second layer has an opening <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> between the first microlens and the mirror, and the third layer has an opening <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> between the second microlens and mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> An electrode <highlight><bold>963</bold></highlight> is provided on the upper surface of the layer <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> in electrical contact with the mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>. The electrode <highlight><bold>963</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to a terminal <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> in the layer <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> that is exposed along the side. The terminal <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> may be formed by any suitable technique such as first creating a via hole or a deep-etched large through hole plated with metal, and then dicing the wafer to expose the metallized hole. Therefore, an electrical control signal can be applied to the MEMS mirror through the terminal <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>963</bold></highlight>. In operation in one embodiment, when voltage is applied to the electrode <highlight><bold>963</bold></highlight>, the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> is pulled into one state down by the electrostatic force between the mirror and the adjacent layer, which acts as the other electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which is a cross-section of integrated 2&times;2 switch shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in a second state. The MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> is movable between two states (e.g. closed and open). In a first state, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> reflects the inputs from both optical paths of two crossing beams to the adjacent optical fiber. In a second state, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the MEMS mirror has been moved out of both optical input paths, thereby allowing the input beam to propagate to the opposite optical fiber. For example, in the first state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the first fiber <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> provides a first input beam <highlight><bold>971</bold></highlight>, then the first input beam <highlight><bold>971</bold></highlight> is reflected to provide a first output beam <highlight><bold>972</bold></highlight> to the second fiber <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight> receives a second input beam <highlight><bold>973</bold></highlight>, then it is reflected by the mirror to provide an output beam <highlight><bold>974</bold></highlight>. However, in the second state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> has been moved to allow the beams to propagate therethrough: particularly, in the second state the first input beam <highlight><bold>971</bold></highlight> provides the first output beam <highlight><bold>974</bold></highlight>, and the second input beam <highlight><bold>973</bold></highlight> provides the first output beam <highlight><bold>972</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It may be noted that the two fiber sockets <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> set the positions of the two fibers <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> offset from the optical axis <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> of the microlens, and therefore the first input beam <highlight><bold>971</bold></highlight> and the first output beam <highlight><bold>972</bold></highlight> form approximately the same angle with the mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> when the mirror is closed as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. As a result, substantially all the optical power will be coupled from the first fiber <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> into the second fiber <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> as long as the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> is in the reflecting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the 2&times;2 switch embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the MEMS mirror is reflective on both sides, and therefore, when the MEMS mirror is in the optical path, it reflects the two input signals from both sides simultaneously. In another embodiment, a 1&times;2 switch can be provided by omitting the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>943</bold></highlight>; and in such embodiments the mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight> need only be reflective on one side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the two-state MEMS switch is that it is completely digital: the mirror may be in one of two distinct, mechanically-stable positions. As a result, the fiber switch is insulated from vibration and electrical disturbance problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The second and third component layers <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> provide the openings <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> between the microlens <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> and the MEMS mirror <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>. If, for example the layers <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> comprise silicon, then the openings <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> may be formed by a wafer-level process such as DRIE etching that creates a through hole in the wafer. When the four component layers <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> are bonded together such as described elsewhere herein, the through holes become hermetically sealed and thus, the openings <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> become hermetically sealed. This can be useful because some embodiments of MEMS fiber optic components require hermetic packaging in order to satisfy environmental requirements. By hermetically sealing the openings <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> where the MEMS mirror resides, the other parts of the switch structure will not require hermetic packaging, which would be the conventional expensive hermetic packaging practice. As a result, a very low cost device packaging can be implemented. In one method, the component layers can be hermetically sealed by using ring shaped solder patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Dual-Pass Tunable Filter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a dual-pass tunable filter that utilizes a MEMS Fabry-Perot etalon and an angled mirror to select the wavelength. The tunable filter is a versatile device, well-suited for wavelength agile networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the structure of the device, including a socket layer <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> having a plurality of sockets formed therein, and first, second, and third component layers <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The socket layer comprises any suitable material such as silicon, and the component layers comprise any suitable material such as glass or silicon. In one embodiment the socket layer comprises silicon, the first component layer comprises glass, and the second and third component layers comprise silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The socket layer <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of sockets formed in a predetermined alignment with respect to the other optical components in the structure. Particularly, the socket layer <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> comprises a first socket <highlight><bold>1131</bold></highlight> that receives a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>1141</bold></highlight>, a second socket <highlight><bold>1132</bold></highlight> that receives a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>1142</bold></highlight>, and a third socket (not shown) that receives a third optical fiber <highlight><bold>1143</bold></highlight>. The optical fibers are arranged within their respective sockets so that their ends are proximate to the interface between the socket layer and the adjacent component layer. The optical fibers typically comprise single mode fibers such as used for telecommunications purposes; however, other optical fibers, such as multimode fibers, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The first component layer <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> includes a microlens <highlight><bold>1121</bold></highlight> whose focal plane is proximate to the interface between the socket layer <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the focal plane of the microlens approximately coincides with the ends of the first, second, and third optical fibers. Each of the first, second, and third sockets are aligned with respect to the microlens <highlight><bold>1121</bold></highlight> so that the cores of the optical fibers are off-axis from the central axes <highlight><bold>1151</bold></highlight> defined by the microlens. In one preferred embodiment of the tunable filter, the cores of the first, second, and third fibers are approximately equidistant from the central axis and from each other, so that their ends approximately define an equilateral triangle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The third component layer <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> comprises a tunable etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight> formed on its upper surface, which provides the tuning mechanism of the dual pass tunable filter. The tunable etalon comprises two high reflectivity thin film mirrors that are separated by a gap, forming a high finesse resonator that controls the resonant wavelength. In some embodiments only one wavelength transmits through the etalon cavity between the two mirror while all other signals are reflected. The tunable etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight> may be constructed by MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The gap between the two high reflectivity mirrors is controlled electrostatically by applying a voltage. Particularly, by varying the voltage, the optical gap distance (i.e. the optical distance between the two mirror of the etalon) can be varied, which change the wavelength transmitted. An electrode <highlight><bold>1163</bold></highlight> is provided on the upper surface of the third layer <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> in electrical contact with the etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight> to provide a system to supply a voltage to the etalon. The electrode <highlight><bold>1163</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to a metal-plated hole <highlight><bold>1164</bold></highlight> in the layer <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight>, such as a via hole or a deep-etched large through hole plated with metal. In operation, as voltage is applied to the electrode <highlight><bold>1163</bold></highlight>, the etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight> is pulled down by the electrostatic force between the electrode and the silicon wafer, which acts as the other electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> An angled mirror <highlight><bold>1181</bold></highlight> is situated below the tunable etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight>. The angled mirror is arranged in a position to reflect light transmitted through the etalon from the first (input) fiber back through the etalon and then to the third optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The first fiber <highlight><bold>1141</bold></highlight> provides an input beam <highlight><bold>1171</bold></highlight>, the second fiber <highlight><bold>1142</bold></highlight> receives a reflected beam <highlight><bold>1172</bold></highlight> from the etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight>, and the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>1173</bold></highlight> receives an output beam transmitted twice through the etalon and reflected from the angled mirror <highlight><bold>1171</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the placement of the angled mirror <highlight><bold>1181</bold></highlight> is such that the reflection is at the same incidence angle as that of the input beam, although the output beam is spatially separated from both the input beam and the etalon-reflected beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In operation, the input beam <highlight><bold>1171</bold></highlight> is incident upon the etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight>, and divides into two beams: the beam <highlight><bold>1172</bold></highlight> reflected from the etalon that includes all wavelengths not transmitted by the etalon, and the output beam <highlight><bold>1173</bold></highlight> that comprises the wavelength selected by the etalon. Because the input beam is incident upon the etalon at an angle, the etalon-reflected beam <highlight><bold>1172</bold></highlight> is coupled into the second optical fiber using the off-axis arrangement of the first microlens. The beam transmitted through the etalon is reflected by the angled mirror <highlight><bold>1171</bold></highlight>, passing again through the etalon (thereby providing further wavelength selectivity) and then is coupled into the third optical fiber <highlight><bold>1143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In comparison with conventional tunable filter, this arrangement provides the reflected signal without the use of an external circulator. In conventional tunable filters, the transmitted signal passes through the resonant cavity only once, which limits the dynamic range of the tunable filter. In comparison, by providing a reflecting mirror near the resonant etalon cavity as described herein, the transmitted signal is reflected back through the resonant cavity. Advantageously, this dual-pass arrangement increases the dynamic range of the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The spatial orientation of the angled mirror <highlight><bold>1171</bold></highlight> is defined by any suitable technique. One way is to cut a silicon wafer with a special orientation so that the (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) plane of the silicon wafer forms the correct orientation. By suitable wet etching of the silicon wafer, the (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) mirror plane will be exposed. A high reflection coating is then deposited on this surface to form the angled mirror with the desired orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The second component layer <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> provides an opening <highlight><bold>1181</bold></highlight> between the microlens <highlight><bold>1121</bold></highlight> and the tunable etalon <highlight><bold>1161</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> may comprise silicon, and the opening <highlight><bold>1181</bold></highlight> may be formed by a wafer-level process such as DRIE etching that creates a through hole in the wafer. When the component layers <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> are bonded together such as described elsewhere herein, the through holes become hermetically sealed and thus, the opening <highlight><bold>1181</bold></highlight> is hermetically sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Multi-Wavelength Laser Transmitter Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to show a waveguide device, and specifically a laser transmitter design (sometimes termed an &ldquo;external cavity&rdquo; laser herein) that can be used to create a multi-wavelength laser array. As will be described, the laser output wavelength of this laser device is determined by the alignment between the components in the device, and thus a different wavelength can be predetermined for individual devices by the patterning process. A multi-wavelength array can be created by patterning the devices and dicing them in such a way that multiple lasers at multiple wavelengths are in the same block, each emitting a different wavelength into its respective fiber port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross section of a laser transmitter that includes a socket layer <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>, a first component layer <highlight><bold>1211</bold></highlight> bonded to the socket layer, a second component layer <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>, a planar Fabry-Perot etalon layer <highlight><bold>1213</bold></highlight> formed on the second component layer <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> and situated between it and the first component layer, and a laser layer <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> bonded to the second component layer. The socket layer <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> includes a socket <highlight><bold>1231</bold></highlight> that receives an optical fiber <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The first component layer includes a first microlens <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight> that has its focal plane approximately at the interface between the socket layer and the first component layer. The first microlens <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight> has a central axis <highlight><bold>1224</bold></highlight> that is arranged slightly off-axis with the core of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight>. The second component layer comprises a second microlens <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> having a central axis <highlight><bold>1226</bold></highlight>. By varying the position of the central axis <highlight><bold>1226</bold></highlight> laterally with respect to the laser turning mirror <highlight><bold>1253</bold></highlight> in the manufacturing process as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>1228</bold></highlight> (i.e. from side-to-side), the wavelength can be varied as a result of changing the angle of incidence of the laser emission upon the Fabry-Perot etalon <highlight><bold>1213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The laser layer <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>, which comprises a suitable semiconductor material such as InP, includes an in-plane waveguide (laser area) <highlight><bold>1251</bold></highlight>. A laser facet <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> is made on the bottom surface of the laser layer by etching a vertical wall into the InP semiconductor material. A 90&deg; turning mirror <highlight><bold>1253</bold></highlight> is defined by etching a 45&deg; slanted surface so that light is reflected upward. Both the vertical facet <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> and the 90&deg; turning mirror <highlight><bold>1253</bold></highlight> can be made by ion milling, for example. To protect the etched surfaces, the bottom surfaces of the laser layer are protected by layer <highlight><bold>1254</bold></highlight> such as a PECVD dielectric layer deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A laser cavity is defined between the laser facet <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> and a partial reflector <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> that is situated proximate to the end of the fiber <highlight><bold>1231</bold></highlight>. Particularly, the laser cavity follows a path that for illustration purposes begins at the laser facet <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> and reflects at about 90&deg; from the turning mirror <highlight><bold>1253</bold></highlight>. Upon leaving the turning mirror, the light beam begins to expand in the laser substrate due to lack of confinement and broadens to a large area by the time it arrives at the upper surface of the laser. Upon exiting the upper surface, the second microlens <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> collimates the laser beam before it hits the Fabry-Perot etalon <highlight><bold>1213</bold></highlight>, which operates to select the laser wavelength. The laser beam is then collimated again by the first microlens <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight> and hits at normal incidence the partial reflector <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> that forms the other laser facet. Some of the light incident upon the partial reflector <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> is reflected to provide the output, and some is reflected to provide feedback to the laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The electrodes of the laser (not shown) may all be provided on the outside of the structure. In one embodiment the laser can be mounted to a heatsink p-side down for heat extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Possible advantages of the external cavity laser design described herein include multi-wavelength capability, elimination of wavelength locker, the thermoelectric (TE) cooler is not required, low chirp, high speed direct modulation possible, high power, simple Fabry-Perot dielectric etalon fabrication, no butterfly packaging required for hermetic sealing, integrated photodetector can be included, and no fiber alignment cost since it pre-aligned in the fabrication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Multi-wavelength by design: The laser wavelength is determined by the incidence angle of the light beam at the Fabry-Perot etalon. The incidence angle, in turn, is defined by the relative position of the upward divergent laser beam with respect to the second microlens <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight>. As a result, by varying the side-to-side position of the etched turning mirror <highlight><bold>1253</bold></highlight> with respect to the second microlens <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> in the fabrication process, the lasing wavelength can be varied. Since these devices are fabricated in large quantities on a single wafer, lasers with many different laser wavelengths can be created. By designing the devices to provide multiple wavelengths on the same wafer stack, multi-wavelength laser transmitter arrays can be built. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Wavelength locker not necessary: Since Fabry-Perot etalons with very low temperature coefficients can be made, the temperature coefficient of the laser can be made very low. This results in the elimination of the wavelength locker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> TE cooler not required: Normal DFB lasers have high temperature coefficient. However, due to the Fabry-Perot etalon which has low temperature coefficient, the external cavity laser may have low temperature coefficient. This may lead to the elimination of a TE cooler. A simple heatsink can be used in place of a TE cooler for lower manufacturing cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Low chirp, high speed direct modulation: It has been reported that an external cavity laser may have much reduced wavelength chirp in direct modulation, because the wavelength selective element is detached from the laser gain medium; particularly a 15 GHz directly modulated laser has been reported with low chirp in an external cavity laser with fiber Bragg grating as one laser facet, for example in Paoletti et al, &ldquo;15 Ghz Modulation Bandwidth, Ultralow-Chirp 1.55-&mgr;m Directly Modulated Hybrid Distributed Bragg Reflector (HDBR) Laser Source, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 10, No. 12, December 1998, pp. 1691-1693. The direct modulation speed depends on the laser cavity length. Compared to the laser reported therein, a shorter laser cavity length may be achieved using the integrated external cavity laser structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. As a result, even 10 Gb/s direct modulation with low wavelength chirp could be achieved in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> High power, simple Fabry-Perot laser: Because there is no sophisticated laser regrowth steps involved, external cavity lasers can offer higher power compared to normal DFB lasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Simple Fabry-Perot dielectric etalon fabrication: The dielectric Fabry-Perot etalon is manufactured with a uniform Fabry-Perot etalon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> No butterfly packaging: The external cavity laser does not require butterfly type hermetic package due to the fact that the etched laser surfaces are all protected by dielectric films. An integrated waveguide photodetector may be made on the other side of the vertical laser facet to monitor the laser power output. The waveguide photodetector is reverse biased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> No additional fiber alignment cost: The external cavity laser array is naturally integrated with the fiber socket so that fiber alignment costs are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> External Cavity Tunable Laser </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a cross-section of an integrated external cavity tunable laser device that emits a single wavelength and is actively tunable across a wavelength range. The tunable laser in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> uses some of the principles and elements described in the multi-wavelength laser transmitter design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> described, but instead of the passive etalon in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> it uses a tilting ultra-narrow passband Fabry-Perot MEMS etalon to provide wavelength selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> This device has four layers bonded together including the socket layer <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> and the first component layer <highlight><bold>1211</bold></highlight> described above. A laser layer <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, which may comprise InP, resembles the laser layer <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, including a laser facet <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> formed on the lower surface, a 90&deg; turning mirror <highlight><bold>1353</bold></highlight>, an in-plane laser area <highlight><bold>1351</bold></highlight> between the laser facet and the turning mirror, and the lower surface has a coating <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight> to protect etched surfaces. In addition a second microlens <highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of the laser layer, which operates to collimate the laser beam from the turning mirror <highlight><bold>1353</bold></highlight>. The second component layer <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight>, which may comprise silicon, includes an opening <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight> that operates as a spacer between the first and second microlenses <highlight><bold>1221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>. The second component layer <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight> also includes a tilting Fabry-Perot etalon <highlight><bold>1361</bold></highlight> deposited on a MEMS structure, which is actuable by a using a signal applied to an electrode <highlight><bold>1321</bold></highlight>. The tilting MEMS Fabry-Perot etalon <highlight><bold>1361</bold></highlight> provides the wavelength selection mechanism by changing the angle of incidence. A laser cavity is defined between the laser facet <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> and a partial reflector <highlight><bold>1255</bold></highlight> that is situated proximate to the end of the fiber <highlight><bold>1231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The external cavity tunable laser of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shares most of the advantages of the multi-wavelength laser transmitter design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. For example, the electrodes of the laser are all on the outside of the structure. The tunable laser can be mounted p-side down to a heatsink for excellent heat extraction. Wafer level hermetic packaging is used for low packaging cost. In some embodiments, additional optical components may be included (e.g. additional component layers) to prevent the tunable laser from mode-hopping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Integrated Pump/Signal Combiner Array </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a combination of an in-plane pump laser integrated with a fiber-coupled filter structure such as disclosed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The resulting device can be used to provide a pump laser beam and combine it with an optical signal to be amplified by an erbium-doped waveguide amplifier for example. Arrays of these devices can be used to pump erbium doped waveguide amplifier arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The fiber-coupled filter structure is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including the socket layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that includes first and second sockets <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> for receiving and positioning first and second optical fibers <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, the first component layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> bonded to the socket layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the second component layer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> that includes a WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> formed on its lower surface. The WDM filter is designed to have a center frequency that transmits the pump laser beam and reflects the signal beam. The first component layer includes the first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that defines the first optical axis <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that is offset from, and approximately equidistant between, the cores of the first and second optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The filter structure, and specifically the second component layer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, is connected to a laser layer <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>, which may comprise GaAs, for example, which would provide an emitting wavelength of about 980 nm. The laser layer <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> includes a laser facet <highlight><bold>1452</bold></highlight> formed on the lower surface, a 90&deg; turning mirror <highlight><bold>1453</bold></highlight>, an in-plane laser area <highlight><bold>1451</bold></highlight> between the laser facet and the turning mirror, and the lower surface has a coating <highlight><bold>1454</bold></highlight> to protect etched surfaces. A Bragg reflector mirror <highlight><bold>1455</bold></highlight> is formed in the laser layer, which operates together with the laser facet <highlight><bold>1452</bold></highlight> to form a laser cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> A second microlens <highlight><bold>1456</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface of the laser layer, which receives the laser beam output from the turning mirror <highlight><bold>1453</bold></highlight>. A central axis <highlight><bold>1457</bold></highlight> defined by the second microlens is offset from the propagation direction of the laser beam from the turning mirror <highlight><bold>1453</bold></highlight>. As a result, when the output of the pump laser strikes the bottom microlens on the other side of the laser substrate, the collimated beam tilts to the right due to the off-axis arrangement of the laser with the second microlens. The pump laser beam, which has a wavelength about the center wavelength than the WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, then transmits through the WDM filter coating. The first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is arranged so that the pump laser beam then is coupled into the second optical fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> on the top right. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In operation a relatively weak optical signal enters the device through the first optical fiber <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The optical signal, which has a wavelength different than the center wavelength of the WDM filter, is reflected by the WDM filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, thereby combining the optical signal with the strong pump laser output generated by the pump laser diode. The combined light beam is then coupled into the second (output) optical fiber <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> using the first microlens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. The second (output) fiber may then be connected to an EDWA input port for amplification of the weak signal, using the pump beam to optically pump the erbium-doped fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Vertical Fiber Integration Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/327,826, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,482 B1, entitled &ldquo;Multilayer Optical Fiber Coupler&rdquo;, incorporated by reference herein, discloses fiber socket technology for aligning a single mode fiber with optical components on other lasers. Herein, the fiber socket technology disclosed in the &apos;482 patent may be utilized as part of the process to make ultra-low cost optical fiber components. In this process, referred to as &ldquo;vertical fiber integration&rdquo; (VFI) technology, multiple wafers are bonded together into a wafer stack for device integration in the wafer surface-normal (vertical) direction, in contrast to current planar waveguide technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The VFI technology is a fiber optic component manufacturing technology in which dense two-dimensional array of identical, functional fiber optic devices are created in the surface normal direction of the wafer stack. Each device includes a passively-aligned optical fiber with all necessary fiber passive alignment structure via the fiber socket technology. For example, in a six-inch diameter wafer stack, some 18,000 pre-aligned and vertically integrated devices can be created with 1 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>die sizes. These devices are separated into chips with a suitable number of devices in arrayed form on each chip. As a result of this technology, time consuming active alignment operations are eliminated, and very substantial cost savings (e.g. two orders of magnitudes) may be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> One advantage of VFI technology is the possibility to achieve ultra-low cost manufacturing of fiber optic components. Therefore it is useful to consider cost in each and every step of the manufacturing process. For example, in addition to photolithographic processing for batch manufacturing, the fiber insertion and device packaging could also be low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The possibility of consistent low cost manufacturing is one advantage of vertical fiber integration technology over other fiber optic component manufacturing technologies, for example, that of Digital Optics Corporation (DOC) in North Carolina. In DOC technology, wafers are bonded together into wafer stacks with vertical optical circuits. The wafer stacks are diced into chips and fiber v-groove arrays are then actively aligned and attached to the chips. Apparently the cost of fiber alignment and packaging dominates in this process and the final cost is believed to be significantly higher than that of vertical fiber integration technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a flow chart that illustrates general operations to form a device using the VFI technology. This process can be illustrated with four basic steps: 1) individual wafer processing as shown at <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>, 2) wafer bonding as shown at <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>, 3) wafer stack dicing as shown at <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight>, and 4) fiber insertion as shown at <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>. Reference may also be made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to describe these steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Step 1. Individual Wafer Processing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>, in a first step a plurality of wafers, which may be silicon, glass or some other suitable material, are obtained and processed in a series of sub-steps using photolithographic means to create two-dimensional arrays of components as required for the particular device to be constructed. Each wafer has a specific pattern with a certain function and/or optical functioning element. The 2-D array of patterns on different wafers are designed with a one-to-one correspondence, so that when the wafers are precisely aligned and permanently bonded together, the patterns on all the wafers form an integrated optical circuit in the surface-normal direction. These elements may include precise vertical holes, microlenses, dielectric thin film filters, mirrors, lasers, and detectors, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Sockets are created to receive the optical fibers. One method for creating the sockets is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D; however other methods could be used. For single mode fiber applications, the fibers may be spatially positioned with about 1 micron alignment accuracy or less. Since the two-dimensional array of patterns on a wafer can be created using photolithography with location errors of less than 0.1 micron, their locations have negligible error with this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the fiber sockets comprise photolithographically-defined, vertical through holes (about 500 &mgr;m deep) with a diameter of about 126 &mgr;m sized to closely match that of the optical fiber. Proper orientation is important, because when the fiber is inserted into the fiber socket, its position and angular orientation are defined by the fiber socket. Positional alignment precision of less than 1 micron can be achieved using the fiber socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> After two or more wafers with precisely defined two-dimensional patterns are being aligned to each other, if two vertically integrated circuits on two opposite sides of the wafer are aligned, all other vertically integrated devices on the same wafer stack are automatically aligned. This feature can be used to eliminate individual active alignment such as used in conventional fiber optic component manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Step 2. Wafer Bonding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>, in a second step after individual wafers are patterned, they are precisely aligned using alignment fiducials, such as shown in the &apos;482 patent, to each other and the wafers are permanently bonded to provide a wafer stack. Each and every die needs to be permanently bonded. Due to the photolithographic creation of the two-dimensional patterns, when two vertical optical circuits are precisely aligned, all the vertical optical circuits on the wafer stack are aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The VFI technology allows many different kinds of materials to be integrated together. Since the thermal expansion properties of the materials can be different, it may be useful to conduct the wafer bonding at lower temperatures to avoid the buildup of thermal stress. A solder bonding method is disclosed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17, 18</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; however other method can be used. Examples of bonding methods include anodic bonding, epoxy bonding, metal bonding, glass-frit bonding, wafer direct bonding, and polyimide bonding. If epoxy bonding is utilized, then it may be useful to deposit a thin layer of epoxy, let it begin curing, and then bond the two layers, which would reduce unwanted upwelling of epoxy into the fiber sockets. In embodiments that include glass and silicon layers, anodic bonding is a particularly useful technology for bonding the silicon layer to the glass layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Step 3. Wafer Stack Dicing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight>, after wafer bonding, the wafer stack is diced into chips as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a small number of vertical optical circuits on each chip using any suitable technique such as cutting with a diamond saw. This way, devices in individual form or arrayed form can both be made with the same level of manufacturing ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Step 4. Fiber Insertion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>, optical fibers are then inserted into the sockets in the chips, such as shown at <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and permanently affixed using epoxy for example. Possible epoxy materials include UV-cured epoxy and thermally cured epoxy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Making a Fiber Socket </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> One method for making the vertical fiber alignment hole is a-dry-etched silicon round hole made by using a silicon deep RIE etcher. The etching process may be the Bosch process, although other processes to create a dry etched hole in silicon may be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> However, the fiber socket may be formed by other methods. In the numerous optical fiber devices disclosed herein, the fiber socket may be created in a number of ways, which should be construed to include all possible ways to create a vertical hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Silicon holes patterned from both sides: Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A, 16B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D. When creating two fiber sockets with very close proximity as disclosed herein in dual fiber type devices, it may be useful to etch the silicon hole from both sides of the wafer rather than from one side. It has been found experimentally that as the wafer is etched deeper, the etched hole loses fidelity in shape compared to the original photomask. This problem is especially severe when two patterns are closely placed on the original photomask, which creates the so called &ldquo;microloading&rdquo; effect. As a result of microloading, etching a mask pattern that begins with two closely-positioned holes and a small gap in between will result in the two holes merging together at the other side. This phenomenon is more severe when photoresist is the etch mask and less severe when an oxide etch mask is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D disclose a method in which an etch mask is patterned on both sides of the wafer, and then etched from each side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> is a cross-section of a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> that has a first oxide etch mask <highlight><bold>1611</bold></highlight> formed on its upper surface and a oxide etch second mask <highlight><bold>1612</bold></highlight> formed on its lower surface. Both masks include openings where the optical fibers are to be formed, and the openings are aligned. Particularly, a first set of openings is aligned about a first centerline <highlight><bold>1621</bold></highlight>, and a second set of openings is aligned about-a second centerline <highlight><bold>1622</bold></highlight>. In one method, the steps of patterning the oxide masks on both sides of the wafer include growing a thermal oxide on both sides of a double-side polished wafer, then the first mask <highlight><bold>1611</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper surface by photolithography and etching of the oxide film, and then the lower surface is aligned and the second mask <highlight><bold>1612</bold></highlight> side is formed by photolithography and etching the oxide film on the lower surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>B, the upper surface exposed through the mask <highlight><bold>1611</bold></highlight> is etched about one-half to substantially more than one-half of the thickness of the wafer <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, but without going through the lower surface. Under suitable conditions, deep DRIE etching creates trenches with a reentrant profile. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> is a cross-section that shows first and second etched holes <highlight><bold>1631</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1632</bold></highlight>, etched respectively about the first and second centerlines, which is the result of etching from the upper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>C, the lower surface exposed through the second mask <highlight><bold>1612</bold></highlight> is etched by a process such as deep RIE etching until first and second sockets <highlight><bold>1641</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1642</bold></highlight> are formed respectively about the centerlines <highlight><bold>1621</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1622</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>D, the first and second oxide masks are stripped using a suitable process, such as hydrofluoric acid etching to form the final socket wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> It has been found that etching from both sides of the wafer as described herein results in well-defined rims on both sides of the fiber hole. In some embodiments, the hole diameters on the photomask on the insertion side of the hole may be made larger than that of the other side to facilitate the fiber insertion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Other methods for forming the fiber socket: Although the dry etched silicon hole, etched from both sides is a preferred method for creating the socket wafer for fiber passive alignment, other methods of making the fiber socket are possible with varying degrees of convenience and performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> For example other methods include wet etching of a diamond shaped vertical hole in a (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) silicon wafer, and plating a round hole using a LIGA process on the back of the microlens wafer. In the LIGA process, tall cylinders of polymer are created on a wafer surface, and thick metal is plated using the cylinders as molds. After the polymer is removed, round through holes in metal are created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Still another possibility in making the fiber socket is by dry etching through a material other than silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Shape of the fiber socket: The shape of the hole may be varied as may be useful or necessary. For example, round holes with vertical grooves on the vertical sidewalls can be used to facilitate the epoxy in escaping from the bottom of the round hole during the fiber insertion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Surface orientation of the fiber socket wafer: Since the fiber socket defines the position of the optical fiber, the side of the fiber socket wafer with the highest precision should be the side of the fiber socket wafer directly bonded to the microlens wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> If the fiber socket is created using an etch mask on only one surface of the wafer, that wafer surface should be the surface that is bonded to the microlens wafer; otherwise there may not be sufficient precision to ensure efficient coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> If the fiber socket wafer is created by etching from both wafer surfaces, the wafer surface with the smaller fiber hole diameter should be bonded to the microlens wafer so that the fibers are more precisely positioned by the fiber sockets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Wafer Bonding Process Using Solder Bonding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17, 18</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. One embodiment of wafer bonding process for the device structures is metal solder bonding. One advantage of this process is the low temperature bonding, which could lead to room temperature bonding capability. In this process multiple embedded electrical thin film heaters are individually activated by running electrical current through them, which melts and reflows the solder wires nearby. The solder wires bond the wafers together without heating the whole wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is perspective view of first, second, third, fourth, and fifth wafers <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> aligned and bonded together. The wafers are arranged with alternating wafer diameters; particularly, the first, third, and fifth wafers have a larger diameter than the second and fourth wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the second and third wafers <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the larger diameter wafers such as the third wafer <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight> have electrical contact areas including first terminal pads <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> and second terminal pads <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> that are connected to heat a solder layer <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>. The second wafer <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, which has a smaller diameter, has a solder layer <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> in a pattern that matches the solder layers <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> on the opposing surface of the third wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In the wafer stack of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the terminal pads <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> extend beyond the edges of the smaller diameter second and fourth layers, so that small electrical contact probes can reach in and provide electrical current to each of the terminal pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the second and third wafers, showing the solder layer <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> on second (smaller) wafer, the opposing solder layer <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> on the third (larger) wafer, and a heater structure, which is connected to the terminal pads <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, that includes a metal conductive layer <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> such as tungsten, covered by an electrical insulator such as an oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> On the smaller diameter wafers, metal solder patterns may be formed by photolithographic liftoff processes on both surfaces of the wafers. On the larger diameter wafers, the metal (e.g. tungsten) heater patterns are formed first, followed by an oxide layer which covers the metal heater patterns, and followed by another layer of solder pattern (e.g. gold-tin) which is directly above the metal heater pattern but insulated from the metal heater pattern by the oxide layer. Both sides of the larger diameter wafers are provided with this structure, except on the outer facing surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> After precise wafer alignment between the two wafers, the two wafers to be bonded are held down by pressure. Pulsed electrical current is sent through the terminal pads to the metal heater wires individually. The generated heat reflows each individual solder pattern in a controlled way without causing significant thermal expansion of the wafer. The reflowed solder pattern balls up due to surface tension and makes contact to the solder pattern on the adjacent wafer. The two solder patterns melt together. This way, any small gap between the two solder patterns is bridged and a constant spacing between the two wafers is maintained by the other solder patterns which are not activated (heated). In some embodiments it may be necessary to place the wafer bonding setup inside an inert environment to facilitate the solder reflow process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference> show a linear pattern for purposes of illustration, some embodiments can utilize other configurations, such as a circular configuration near the circumference of the wafers. Such a configuration would effectively seal the volume within the circular pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Anti-Reflection Coating </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> An anti-reflection coating may be desirable for every optical surface in the vertical stack. The AR coating step is done after optical patterns such as microlenses have been formed. In the devices disclosed herein, the steps of AR coating may not be discussed specifically for each device, but may be implemented as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Wafer Level Hermetic Packaging </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In fiber optic devices such as lasers, detectors and MEMS switches, it is frequently necessary to enclose environmentally sensitive devices inside a hermetically sealed metal package. Conventionally, these metal packages are expensive, and they exacerbate the difficulty of manufacturing fiber optic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Using the vertical fiber integration technology, it is possible to achieve hermetic packaging on a wafer level, for all of the devices contained in the wafer. Particularly, the sensitive spaces such as MEMS cavities are sealed off from the outside environment by the two adjacent wafers bonded together. In the case of solder bonding, the spaces are sealed off by suitably designed solder rings around the cavities. These metal solder rings reflow during the wafer bonding process and hermetically seal the sensitive areas from the outside environment, without any special wafer bonding arrangement. For added reliability, two rings may be used to encircle the same cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> With the sensitive areas hermetically sealed by the solder rings, the reliability of a fiber optic component depends on the reliability of the fiber socket, the fiber, and the epoxy. With a suitably chosen uv- or thermal-cured epoxy, it should not be necessary to hermetically seal the fiber sockets in order for the fiber optic component to pass Bellcore environmental tests. Therefore low cost manufacturing of previously hermetically sealed fiber optic components is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Fiber Optic Device Packaging </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Because the vertical fiber integration technology provides automatic fiber passive alignment with ultra-low cost, the goal of the device packaging is to provide a rugged fiber device package, rather than to maintain fiber alignment as is currently done in conventional fiber optic device packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The packaging processes may employ low cost injection molding or epoxy potting to encapsulate the vertically integrated optical circuit, which has fibers already inserted into the fiber sockets and fixed permanently with epoxy. Suitable strain relief rubber boots may be provided to ensure the fully packaged devices withstand fiber side pull tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Fiber Optic Receiver </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a cross-section of an integrated fiber receiver, which illustrates an example of a device that can be constructed with the metal solder technique. The receiver in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> has a socket layer <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, a component layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, and a photodetector layer <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> that is bonded to the component layer by a metal solder technique, such as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17, 18</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As a result of this bonding technique, a metal solder layer <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> is situated between the component and photodetector layers, which provides wafer level hermetic packaging. Particularly, the metal solder technique creates a hermetically-sealed opening <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> between the microlens <highlight><bold>2021</bold></highlight> and the photodetector section <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The socket layer <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, which may comprise silicon, includes a socket <highlight><bold>2041</bold></highlight> for receiving an optical fiber <highlight><bold>2041</bold></highlight>. The component layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> includes a microlens <highlight><bold>2021</bold></highlight> having a central axis that is aligned with the core of the optical fiber. The photodetector layer includes a photodetector <highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>, comprising for example a InGaAs detector, that is arranged to receive input light from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2041</bold></highlight> focused by the microlens <highlight><bold>2021</bold></highlight>. The photodetector <highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight> and the photoconductor layer <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> comprise any suitable material, such as InP. Electrical connection can be provided by any suitable connection, such as using wire bonding in the open area or using a via hole <highlight><bold>2051</bold></highlight> on the photodetector layer. The solder layer <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight>, or another electrode may be used to connect the photodetector with a monitoring device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In operation, the input signal from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2031</bold></highlight> is focused by the microlens <highlight><bold>2021</bold></highlight> and hits the photodetector area <highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>. The optical energy is converted to electrical signal by the photodetector, which then provides an appropriate output. </paragraph>
