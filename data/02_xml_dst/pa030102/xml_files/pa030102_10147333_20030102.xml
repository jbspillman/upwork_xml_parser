<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to telecommunications, and more specifically, to a system and method for the all optical reshaping and regeneration, as well as wavelength conversion, of optical signals in a data network. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Noise, and attenuation in long-haul optical line systems result in the deterioration of the transmitted signal, both as to its amplitude as well as its shape. Consequently, one of the fundamental requirements of nodal equipment in optical networks is the capability to regenerate and reshape the optical pulses. These functions are known as 2R, for regeneration and reshaping. Notwithstanding the plethora of claims by various companies to have implemented &ldquo;all-optical&rdquo; systems, presently retiming of the optical pulses is achieved by converting the incoming optical signal into an electrical signal. This is followed by full regeneration and reshaping of the electrical signal using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). A laser source is then modulated using this fully regenerated and reshaped electrical signal. Such systems are termed OEO, or Optical-Electrical-Optical. However, there are certain drawbacks to converting an optical signal into an electrical one and back again. First, electrical processing of data signals is not transparent to bit rate and is format sensitive. Thus, an OEO system could not process an arbitrary incoming data signal; the bit rate, format and coding would need to be known a priori. Different bit rates require different ASICs to process them in the electrical domain. Second, there is a significant power loss in converting to the electrical domain, and a similar power loss in converting back again therefrom to the optical domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As optical networks become increasingly transparent, there is thus a need to regenerate the signal without resorting to OEO conversion of the signal. Such regeneration, if truly done all optically, is termed AO2R, for &ldquo;all optical regeneration and reshaping.&rdquo; This would free the network nodes from the limitations placed on signal processing by the electrical domain processing circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Future optical networking line systems will incorporate service signals at both 10 Gb/s as well as 40 Gb/s along with their associated Forward Error Corrected (FEC) overhead. Beyond that 80 Gb/s is just around the corner. The FEC rates related to, for example, 10 Gb/s data transport include the 64/63 coding for 10 Gb/s Ethernet, the 15/14 encoding of SONET-OC192 FEC and the strong-FEC rate of 12.25 Gb/s, as well as numerous potential coding schemes yet to be developed. Effectively, to support multiple FEC&mdash;and other coding related&mdash;protocols, an optical network node must be able to process numerous line rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, it is a useful function to be able to switch a signal that came in on one wavelength to output on another. This may arise when an input signal arriving from a client on one service wavelength is provisioned outbound on another. In conventional OEO 2R systems, it is a simple matter to switch an incoming signal to a different wavelength inasmuch as once the signal has been converted to the electrical domain, it is feasible to reconvert it to the optical domain on a different wavelength than the one it arrived on by using the electrical signal to drive a laser at a new different wavelength. The problem arises in achieving this functionality in an AO2R system, where the signal remains in the optical domain at its original wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> What is needed therefore, is an AO2R system, that is truly all-optical, that is transparent to both bit rate and protocol or format, and that supports any wavelength in the carrier frequency range (wavelength range) of the modern telecommunications systems, the C and L wavelength bands, and that can convert an incoming signal to a different wavelength when it is output. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A system, method and device for AO2R is presented. The AO2R system presented is redundant, containing multiple pathways for the input and output signals to travel.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Before one or more embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction or the arrangements of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings (the terms &ldquo;construction&rdquo; and &ldquo;components&rdquo; being understood in the most general sense and thus referring to and including, in appropriate contexts, methods, algorithms, processes and sub-processes). The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as in any way limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In modern all optical data networks, a high availability optical signal processor is required to improve the reliability of a transmitted data signal. Such a high availability signal processor would accomplish reshaping and regeneration of the incoming noisy or &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; input signal, whose originally clean square pulse waveforms have lost amplitude, have spread out beyond their original pulse widths, and have had noise waveforms introduced as well over their long trip through the DWDM long haul leg of the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The basic components of a module to perform all optical reshaping and regeneration are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and will be described with reference thereto. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a redundant all optical AO2R/wavelength conversion module, as shall be described below. The basic components of this module are semiconductor optical amplifiers (&ldquo;SOAs&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> represented by the short wide rectangles, multimode interferometers (&ldquo;MMIs&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> represented by the tall wide rectangles and optical waveguides <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> represented as straight or curved lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For commercial applications, an AO2R module, to be viable, must not work only some of the time; it must work all of the time. Moreover, in light of the structures depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that there are numerous components to the AO2R module. When the AO2R module is fabricated on an integrated optical circuit, under current manufacturing processes not all of the SOAs are generally viable. In fact, only a certain proportion of SOAs fabricated in any given fabrication run are operable to required specifications. Such proportion can be expressed as a yield Y which is a number between zero and unity. If each SOA was mission critical, or put another way, there was no redundancy, one failed SOA could render the entire module unusable, wasting both energy, physical and monetary resources, and time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention obviates many yield related concerns by exploiting a built in redundancy. Such redundancy exploitation will next be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts an exemplary AO2R module in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. What is shown is a 3&times;3 integrated optical device using six multimode interferometers <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and ten SOAs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As will be shown with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the module of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in actuality contains two disjoint AO2R modules, each of which can perform the AO2R functionality. Moreover, what should be noted is that the multimode interferometer located adjacent to SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is depicted as having only one input port. In actuality, like all 2&times;2 multimode interferometers it has two input ports. This implies that instead of SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> only being capable of inputting, or outputting, as the case may be, optical signals to and from the interferometers <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>B, there is also an unshown additional I/O port to each of these central line interferometers <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>B which can be used to input/output optical signals. The device could thus be built with additional SOAs attached to each of these input <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> waveguides increasing further the redundancy of the device, as shall be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The basic operation of the device will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an incoming &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> on wavelength lambda <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is input to the device at the upper right of the figure. It passes through amplifying SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through multimode interferometer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>A and to SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> does not act as an amplifying semiconductor optical amplifier but rather as an SOA in saturation mode whose function is to induce phase modulation upon receipt of an incoming signal. Thus, the functionality of the module depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is as follows: a continuous wavelength (&ldquo;CW&rdquo;) light source at wavelength lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inputted through the device through SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an amplifying SOA, and the signal is then propagated through MMI <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>E and MMIs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>D. Next, through SOAs <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, through MMIs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>B where the signals recombine and MMI <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>F one part of which, taking half the signal from the 3 DB coupler, is outputted through amplifying SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as the clean signal, having the same wavelength as the continuous wavelength input, or lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is subjected to a bias voltage from an external voltage source such that there is a phase difference of 180 degrees between SOAs <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the absence of an input signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> the continuous wavelength light signal <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> will combine destructively due to the phase shift between SOAs <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and there will not be output any clean signal <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> However, if an incoming &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is received and propagated through SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and further propagated through MMI <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>A so as to be absorbed by SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> undergoes the corresponding 180 degree phase modulation due to the incoming signal and at this point SOAs <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are once again in phase; thus the CW light <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> constructively interferes and comes out as clean signal <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. For this reason, SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is labeled as &ldquo;signal induced phase modulation&rdquo; as opposed to phase modulation due to a bias voltage as in the case of SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the existence of a pulse on the dirty signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> will cause constructive interference in MMI <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>F of a clean CW <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> signal resulting in a clean pulse output <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. If there is no pulse on the dirty input signal line, then the CW light is destructively interfered and no pulse appears on the output <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. In this fashion, the dirty input signal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, assumably coming from a long journey, inputs to the AO2R module to modulate the clean signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the clean signal, i.e., CW <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, is on a different wavelength lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, this results in wavelength conversion as well. Of course, lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could be set equal to lambda <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which case wavelength conversion would not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments the use of wavelength conversion or not will depend on network conditions, and the possible preference of one wavelength over another at a certain network node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the clean signal propagates from left to right and the dirty signal propagates from right to left ultimately be absorbed at SOA <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and induce phase modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that a nearly disjoint structure exists accomplishing the same functionality. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, instead of utilizing central SOAs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as is done in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, SOAs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> could be utilized to achieve the same results. Thus, if something was wrong with either SOAs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the alternative configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> could be utilized. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, that configuration uses one of SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as the SOA with the externally applied bias voltage and the other one is utilized as being in line with the dirty signal input <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. The dirty signal input at lambda <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> thus modulates the clean CW <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> signal at lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and causes it to constructively interfere when there is an input pulse on the dirty signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> input such that a clean pulse is outputted at lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the ooutput of the device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. It is noted that the input and output directions of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are reversed relative to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; this is arbitrary and just as easily the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> could be rotated 180 degrees about a line running vertically between SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> such that the clean output signal would output to the right of the figure and the continuous wavelength input signal would be input at the left of the figure, with the dirty signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> being input at the right of the figure as well. What is necessary in the AO3R configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> is simply that the continuous wavelength input enters at one side of the device and the clean output enters on the opposite side, and that the dirty signal input enters from the same side from which the clean signal output exits. Finally, the dirty signal must propagate through a central SOA which does not have a bias voltage (so that it can modulate the phase via signal induced phase modulation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For maximum redundancy, the way to construct the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is to set each of SOAs <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to receive an external electrical bias. If the SOA in question is ultimately desired to be used as an SOA with an external bias, then the bias will be applied thereat. If not, the bias port will be non-utilized and the SOA will be used for the purposes of signal induced phase modulation. In that way, there is flexibility as to which of SOAs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be utilized to input the dirty signal. In every possible configuration of th edevice of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are critical. One of them must be used for a CW input, the other must be used for the clean output. As described above however, it is not necessary to rely on the simultaneous viability of both SOAs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. An additional shadow SOA could be appended to the non-depicted and non-used I/O waveguide to each of MMIs <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> such that only one of SOA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and its shadow and only one of SOA<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and its shadow need to be operable for the device to work. This would be the configuration of the device fabricated in a preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, the devices of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be once again presented in an alternative manner for ease of illustration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with the SOAs relabeled in terms of As, Bs and Cs. This wavelength scheme reflects the function of the various SOAs. SOAs labeled A are the inputs and outputs of the clean signal, in the general case at lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is different than the input dirty signal wavelength lambda <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. SOAs labeled B are the central SOAs which are responsible for creating states of constructive or destructive interference for the CW input signal. It is noted that SOAs B do not function as amplifying SOAs, but rather as SOAs operating in the saturation region whose function is to implement signal induced phase modulation. SOAs labeled C are the potential inputs for the dirty signal, nominally at lambda <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If, as described above, each of SOAs B has the capacity to take an external electrical bias, whether by voltage or current, then there is flexibility in the use of any of the SOAs labeled C as the input of the dirty signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the configuration depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will now be described. However, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> not only shows the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, but also shows the rest of the device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, so that the redundancy can be better appreciated. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the CW input lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> is input from the left of the figure through SOA A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. From there it is fed into MMI <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>A and from there to each of MMIs <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>C. The signal output from one port of MMI <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>B is taken through SOA B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is the SOA which will implement the signal induced phase modulation. Accordingly, dirty signal <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> needs to be input from the top right of the figure. The reason that it must be input from the top right of the figure is as follows. Once the B-type SOA to implement signal induced phase modulation is chosen, the only possible port into which the dirty signal <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> can be input, is one through which the dirty signal <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> can cross propagate relative to the CW input signal <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. Thus, it must provide a path through the chosen B-type SOA, which originates on the opposite side of the device as does the CW input. It is noted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as well as the other figures presented, that the CW input signal is split by MMI <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>A into a upper and a lower signal. One of these two pathways must be the pathway where signal phase induced modulation is implemented and the other pathways must be the one where an external bias current or bias voltage is applied. This is the means by which constructive and destructive interference of the two &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; signals of CW signal <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> is effected. Therefore, the B-type SOAs are naturally divided into two distinct pairs. At least one SOA from each pair must be operable as a signal induced phase modulator and at least one SOA from the other pair of B-type SOAs must be operable under an external bias current or bias voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the upper pair of B-type SOAs has been chosen to implement signal induced phase modulation. Thisdetermines that at least one of the lower pair of SOAs B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, must be operable to introduce phase modulation in response to an external bias current or bias voltage. Which pair is chosen for which is arbitrary. However, once one pair is chosen, the other pairs&apos; function is determined. Similarly, once the pair implementing signal induced phase modulation is chosen, whether the top or whether the bottom of the device can serve as the input for the dirty signal is also determined. The dirty input signal <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> must be input on the same vertical side (i.e., top or bottom), as that which the signal induced phase modulator B-type SOA is located. In the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, since B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is functioning as the signal induced phase modulator then amplifying SOA C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the only choice for the dirty signal input <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>. In parallel fashion, instead of B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the upper B-type SOA from the upper pair of B-type SOAs, namely B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, could equivalently function as the signal induced phase modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> SOAs which are operable, but not needed as amplifiers in the chosen signal path can be made to operate in the absorbing mode in order to absorb back-reflected signals and thus reduce the effect of stray reflections on the quality of the processed signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, had the signal induced phase modulator SOA been desired to be from the lower pair (i.e., B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) of B-type SOAs, then at least one of the SOAs from the pair B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would have to function as inducing phase modulation in response to an external bias current or bias voltage and C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> would have to be the input for the dirty signal <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> so that it could cross propagate through the same SOA implementing the signal induced phase modulation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> therefore depict two out of eight possible configurations which will implement the AO2R functionality of the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>. It is noted that to exhaustively describe each of these eight possibilities would be too redundant even for an invention which deals with exploitation of redundancies. It is noted that one more example embodiment should suffice to convey the functionality common to all of the possible exemplary embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that final example will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> has numerous similarities to the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In both, the left side of the device has been chosen as the input for the CW signal, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> labeled as <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>. In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the lower pair of B-type SOAs, namely B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; and B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; are those SOAs which will function in response to an external bias current or bias voltage. Therefore, the upper pair of SOAs B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will provide the ultimate B-type SOA that accesses a signal induced phase modulator. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, while that SOA is B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> it could just as well be B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Given the fact that signal induced phase modulation is occurring in the upper, or top portion of the figure in the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, utilizing SOA B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the dirty signal <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> which is to be optically processed must enter from the right side of the figure through amplifying SOA C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Finally, the clean signal on the same wavelength lambda <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the CW input <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> exits at one of the I/O ports to MMI <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>F. In the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is shown exiting through amplifying SOA A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The following addresses mathematically the benefits of the redundancy of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Let p equal the probability of successfully manufacturing an individual SOA.

The probability of this outcome is: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition, at least 2 out of the four central SOA&apos;s (the B&apos;s) must succeed, one from the top (unprimed) and one from the bottom (primed). Explicitly, any of the following successful combinations will work: (B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B&prime;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), (B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, B&prime;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), (B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, B&prime;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), (B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, B&prime;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The probability of this outcome is: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The overall probability of the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (and similar figures) working is thus </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>P&equals;P<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>P<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>P<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If p&equals;0.3, the overall probability of success for a non-redundant device is p<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.00243. If p&equals;0.3, the overall probability of success for a redundant device is roughly P&equals;0.0178, representing more than a sevenfold increase in yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a configuration with all SOA&apos;s working. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a configuration with only 5 SOA&apos;s working. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows another configuration with only 5 SOA&apos;s working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> shows that they are related by a 180 degree rotation of the device. The external interfaces (laser, input, output) remain in the same position. Thus, the yield enhancement property does not destroy the modularity of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is noted that in an alternate embodiment of the device of FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (and similar figures), a tunable laser will be used as the CW input, allowing a spectrum of output wavelengths as opposed to one fixed output wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, the structure of the present invention can be expanded to an N&times;N device, where each MMI is N&times;N. Such expansion can be utilized to further increase redundancy, or to allow for high availability optical signal processing, providing numerous possible pathways. Such a general N&times;N device is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> depicts the extension of the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for the case N&equals;3. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, SOAs are drawn as small rectangular boxes, and MMIs are drawn as larger approximately square boxes. As can be seen, there are 9 inputs and 9 outputs to the device. In the depicted configuration (there being numerous possible configurations in terms of where the CW and dirty inputs, and the clean output signals, could be connected) the CW input <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> could be at three possible inputs to MMI <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>A, and the clean output at three possible connections to MMI <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>B. As well the dirty signal input could utilize any of six possible inputs. There are nine central SOAs, and only two are needed for the constructive/destructive interference of the CW input (accomplished as above, with one SOA under a bias to shift its phase, and the other implementing signal induced phase shifts) which ultimately occurs in MMI <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>B, allowing for numerous possible combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the concept of the present invention can be expanded as well, not being restricted to an AO2R device as described herein. Any integrated optical device for optical signal processing can be constructed with varying quantities of redundancy so as to provide multiple pathways for incoming and outgoing optical signals, and thus facilitate high availability signal processing in photonic networks. Such devices offer N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>information pathways (waveguide&rarr;SOA&rarr;waveguide) of equal length to transmit DWDM or other optical data signals. In this manner, transmitted data signals at the output of each of the multimode interference couplers (&ldquo;MMIC&rdquo;s) have the choice of N pathways to travel. In event of a failure in a single pathway, N&minus;1 pathways would still be available for data transmission. Thus, in general, such circuits improve the yield, i.e. probability of successful transmission of the data signal, by a factor of N<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, using an N&times;N MMIC and N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>information pathways of equal length. The device described above is this general N&times;N solution specific to a 2&times;2 AO2R/Wavelength Converter circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the above discussion describes the benefit of redundancy which insures a higher yield of device. As well, in fabrication technologies where the probability of failure of an SOA or other component is low, and thus nearly all SOAs would be functional, the method and device of the present invention can be utilized in applications which require multiple copies of an output signal for use in further processing, or utilize the extra SOAs for alternative uses such as monitoring, photodetection, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment, although the preferred embodiment of the present invention contemplates use in an all-optical communications or data system, it could alternatively be utilized as a retrofit for an OEO system. As the data rate of optical transmission system increases, receivers with high bandwidth are required. However, sensitivity of a receiver for the same Bit Error Rate (BER) decreases as the data rate increases. For example, the sensitivity of a typical PIN detector at 10 Gbps is &minus;16 dBm, while the sensitivity of the same detector at 40 Gbps would be approximately &minus;10 dBm. This sensitivity is not practical for a typical optical transmission system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Thus, using the device and method of the present invention, a high performance receiver package could be constructed that consists of two stages; the first stage for signal quality improvement and the second stage for optical to electrical conversion. The input signal quality improvement in the first stage is achieved using the all optical signal processor (AOSP) described above. The AOSP improves OSNR of the input signal by regenerating the signal before optical to electrical conversion in the second stage. As an example, the first stage could be the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Essentially the clean output from the AOSP, i.e., the output <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, would then be subjected to OEO conversion in the second stage. Such uses would for example be beneficial in systems which perform retiming via OEO conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> While the above describes the preferred embodiments of the invention, various modifications or additions will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Such modifications and additions are intended to be covered by the following claims. </paragraph>
