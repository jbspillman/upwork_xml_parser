<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor analysis apparatus, a semiconductor analysis method and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which a minute defective location can be accurately determined by using a Raman spectroscopic analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of a conventional semiconductor analysis apparatus. The semiconductor analysis apparatus is used for a method for analyzing defects in semiconductor devices using a liquid crystal analysis. The liquid crystal analysis is an analysis method using a polarizing phenomenon of the liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A device to be measured <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> defining an object to be measured is a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus in a state in which circuits are completed on a semiconductor wafer. To observe the internal state of the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus to analyze defects therein, liquid crystal is thinly coated on its surface, and the liquid crystal is heated up to about a polarizing temperature. Then, it is placed in a measurement apparatus that is similar to a semiconductor wafer prober, and probes are abutted against bonding pads thereof to achieve electrical connection. Operation voltages and input signals that operate the internal circuits are supplied through the probes from a tester <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that is composed of a pattern generation circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an oscillation circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a control circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A TV camera <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> photographs the entire area of at least one semiconductor integrated circuit or the entire area of circuits to be focused on the surface of the device to be measured <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. To photograph the device to be measured <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the camera <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided with a lens system that magnifies and photographs the surface of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As well known, the refractive index of liquid crystal is temperature dependent. In the mean time, wirings and elements on the device to be measured generate heat according to currents that circulate therein. Accordingly, the refractive index of liquid crystal coated on the surface changes according to the wirings and elements in which currents circulate, and they appear as a pattern. In other words, an image photographed by the camera has a pattern corresponding to the wiring and element pattern in which current circulates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A signal of the image photographed by the camera is converted by a data converter <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> into two-digit pattern data and inputted in a computer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is provided with circuit-logic information <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and layout information <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> being as expected values, examines the circuit logic information according to inputted conditions given by the tester <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and forms pattern information of the passages and elements in which current should circulate based on the layout information. The pattern information is compared with the actual pattern obtained by the data conversion described above to thereby analyze presence or absence of defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In other words, by coating liquid crystal on a wafer and heating the liquid crystal adjacent to a polarizing temperature, and specifying defective locations that generate heat upon circulating current in the semiconductor integrated circuit, a defect analysis is conducted. Defective locations that can be concretely specified by the semiconductor analysis apparatus are those defective potions caused by metal short-circuits and defective locations having a higher resistance than a designed value. These defective locations involve greater heat generation than the normal case. Therefore, they can be specified as defective locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the conventional semiconductor analysis apparatus described above uses liquid crystal that is harmful to the human body, and the liquid crystal is carcinogenic material. In addition, since the polarizing area of liquid crystal spreads widely, it is difficult to narrow down a spot for detecting a defective location to a minute area. This is becoming a greater problem as the miniaturization of the design rule is further progressed. In other words, it is difficult to accurately specify a minute defective location in a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus that is greatly miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there is a hot electron analysis that takes a shorter analyzing time. However, the hot electron analysis can only be applied to objects that accompany light emission of hot electrons, and thus cannot specify defects involving short circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is made in view of the circumstances described above, and its object is to provide a semiconductor analysis apparatus, a semiconductor analysis method and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which a minute defective location can be accurately determined. </paragraph>

Therefore, it can specify a defective location such as a subtle metal short-circuit defect to a degree that can be barely specified by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and is capable of analyzing a spot region of up to 0.2 &mgr;m.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically shows a structure of a semiconductor analysis apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The semiconductor analysis apparatus uses the principle of laser Raman spectroscopy, and uses Raman spectrum shift to measure temperature of minute areas in a semiconductor wafer to thereby specify minute defective locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor analysis apparatus is formed from a laser oscillator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that emits laser beams, a stage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for mounting thereon a semiconductor wafer (or IC chip) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> defining an object to be analyzed, a Raman spectroscopy apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a data converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a laser microscope <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a data converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Semiconductor integrated circuits in a completed form are formed on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The laser oscillator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is structured such that it can emit a Raman laser and a laser for taking a wafer pattern (chip pattern) image. Also, as the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> irradiates the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the Raman laser beam, the Raman spectroscopy apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> takes out and spectroscopically separates scattered light scattered on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and detects a shifted position of a specified peak value of the obtained Raman spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> irradiates the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the wafer pattern image taking laser beam, the laser microscope (camera) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> receives reflected light from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and obtains a wafer pattern image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, an analysis method using the semiconductor analysis apparatus described above will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is an object to be analyzed is placed on the stage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. By using a measuring apparatus similar to a semiconductor wafer prober, its probes are pressed against the bonding pads for electrical connection. Then, operation voltages and input signals that operate the internal circuits are supplied through the probes from a tester that is composed of a pattern generation circuit, an oscillation circuit and a control circuit, to thereby place the internal circuits in an operating state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, the Raman laser beam and wafer pattern image taking laser beam emitted from the laser oscillator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are irradiated on the surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The Raman spectroscopy apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> takes out light (scattered light) scattered in the solid of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the Raman spectroscopy apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> spectroscopically separates the light, whose frequency is converted by the data converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into light intensity, which is then inputted in the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to calculate peak values. At the same time, the laser microscope <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> receives light (reflected light) reflected on the surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to obtain a pattern image. Then, the data converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> converts data representative of the pattern image, and the converted data is inputted in the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Next, the computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> calculates amounts of shifts in Raman spectra, which appear due to the Raman effect, whereby temperature of minute areas of the object to be measured is calculated based on the relation between the temperature obtained in advance and the amounts of frequency shifts. Then, the temperature data for the fine regions and the pattern image data are combined, and the same is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In other words, when current is circulated through devices on a wafer or in the state of chips, and if defective locations such as metal short-circuits are present, heat is generated at the defective locations. The semiconductor analysis apparatus described above uses Raman spectra shifts given by a Raman spectroscopy apparatus to detects location where heat is generated, whereby minute defective locations in minute areas can be accurately specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, Raman spectra shifts are used to detect heat generated at defective locations to thereby specify the defective locations. With this Raman spectroscopic analysis, Raman spectrum shifts are sensitive to temperatures of an object to be measured. Therefore, it can specify a defective location such as a subtle metal short-circuit defect to a degree that can be barely specified by a SEM, and is capable of analyzing a spot region of up to 0.2 &mgr;m. Therefore, a defective area such as a metal short-circuit can be narrowed down to a fine region in a short time. In particular, defective locations can be readily and accurately specified even when miniaturization of the design rule is further advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also, unlike the conventional technology, the present embodiment does not use liquid crystal that is harmful to the human body, and therefore safety of the operators can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, but many modifications thereof can be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention uses Raman spectra shifts to detect heat generated at defective locations to thereby specify the defective locations. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a semiconductor analysis apparatus, a semiconductor analysis method and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which a minute defective location can be accurately determined. </paragraph>
