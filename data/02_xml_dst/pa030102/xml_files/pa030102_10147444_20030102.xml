<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a drill bit and a method for grinding a drill bit having two major cutting edges connected via a chisel edge, adjacent to each of which major cutting edges is a clearance face that transitions into a flute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such drill bits are used for, among other things, twist drills in which the chips removed by the drill bit are removed via flutes in the drill that run in a spiral pattern. For this purpose, the drill bit and drill are designed in one or two pieces. In the two-piece design, the drill bit is realized in particular in the form of a replaceable insert for a drill base element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The geometric configuration, and especially the grinding of the drill bit, determines to a significant extent the cutting action of the drill and the mechanical load on the drill, especially on the drill bit. The mechanical load during drilling is also determined by, among other things, the configuration of the area around the chisel edge. To reduce the load, the chisel edge is therefore generally pointed during grinding. With pointing, the rake angle is determined in the area of the drill core, which defines the angle between the surface adjoining the chisel edge and the longitudinal axis of the drill. This surface is referred to below as the chisel edge surface. The rake angle in the area of the chisel edge facing away from the major cutting edge is determined, in particular, by where the clearance face associated with the cutting edge transitions into the flute. A positive rake angle is often desired in this area. A positive rake angle means that the chisel edge surface is tilted toward the longitudinal axis of the drill, so that a type of overhang is formed. On the other hand, with a negative rake angle, this surface is tilted away from the axis of the drill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In conventional grinding methods with pointing, the major cutting edges and the chisel edge, as well as the clearance faces adjoining the major cutting edges, are ground in a first process step. The pointing is then carried out in a second working step. For this purpose, it is essential that the grinding wheel used for the grinding be reset. Consequently a ridge, i.e., a discontinuity, is ground into both the clearance face and the chisel edge surface. The ridge in the chisel edge surface is necessarily formed because, under all circumstances, the grinding wheel must be prevented from reaching the chisel edge already ground during pointing. In the area of the chisel edge, this ridge causes stress peaks that lead to increased loading on the drill bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> More recent development trends have attempted to produce drill bits without grinding via a metal injection molding process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The object of this invention is to configure a drill bit so that the mechanical loads that occur during drilling are kept low. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention teaches that this object can be accomplished by a method for grinding a drill bit having two major cutting edges joined via a chisel edge, adjacent to each of which is a clearance face that transitions into a flute, whereby the clearance face is realized in the form of a curved surface without ridges from the major cutting edge toward the flute with a radius of curvature R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A drill tip of this type has the significant advantage that, on account of the curved, ridge-free surface with the radius of curvature R, therefore because the surface has a profile without shoulders, the load on the drill tip during drilling is low. In particular, no stress peaks occur in the area of the chisel edge surfaces of the type that occur on conventionally ground drill tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additional preferred embodiments of the drill bit are described in the features of the invention included herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The drill bit is preferably a ground drill bit. Alternatively, the geometry described above can also be achieved with a metal injection molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the drill bit is realized in the form of a replaceable insert for a drill base element. This type of two-part drill, consisting of a drill bit and drill base element, has the major advantage that the drill bit, which is subject to wear, can be easily replaced. The drill base element is generally exposed to much less wear, so that its useful life is several times longer than the useful life of the drill bit. By realizing the drill bit in the form of a replaceable insert, operating costs can therefore be reduced significantly. Moreover, the drill base element can be realized from a more economical and thus generally softer material than the material of which the drill bit is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention further teaches a method for grinding a drill bit that has, among other things, two major cutting edges connected to each other via a chisel edge, adjacent to each of which major cutting edges is a clearance face that transitions into a flute, whereby a grinding wheel used for the grinding and the drill tip are guided toward each other in a continuous grinding process so that the clearance face is realized in the form of a surface that curves from the major cutting edge toward the flute with a radius of curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The grinding wheel and drill bit are thereby guided toward each other in a complex three-dimensional grinding process, so that the drill bit is ground in the desired manner without the requirement for two separate grinding processes. On account of the continuous grinding process, no ridges are formed in the area of the clearance face and chisel edge surface of the type that would be unavoidably formed in a two stage grinding process. Therefore, as a result of the three-dimensional guidance of the drill tip and the grinding wheel, the two conventional grinding steps are therefore combined into one grinding step. The advantages of this method are reflected in, among other things, the curvature of the clearance face. On account of the shoulder-less and ridge-less profile of the ground surfaces of the drill tip, the load on the drill tip during drilling is also kept low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> One other possible advantage of the above-described drill tip design is that the power needed to rotate the drill during a cutting or drilling operation in some materials can be reduced by as much as approximately 30% over drill tips of the prior art, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of this application. Therefore the energy requirement for operation of a drive or motor mechanism to rotate the drill during drilling is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For the lowest possible load on the drill tip, the method is preferably carried out so that the radius of curvature is between 0.05 and 0.5 times the diameter of the drill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To form the curved surface, the grinding wheel comprises a main grinding surface that is pivoted relative to the drill bit by a pivot angle. This pivoting movement can be executed either by the drill bit, or by the grinding surface, or by both together. The angle referred to as the pivot angle is reduced during this pivoting movement between the surface normals of the main grinding surface and the longitudinal axis of the drill bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To form an appropriate drill bit geometry, the drill bit is preferably first rotated around its longitudinal axis up to an angle of rotation, and only then does pivoting by the pivot angle occur. Consequently, the clearance face directly adjacent to the major cutting edge, which is called the main clearance face, initially runs obliquely and is then increasingly curved toward the flute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For the most uniform possible realization of the curved surface, as it pivots by the pivot angle &agr;, the drill bit is simultaneously rotated further to a predetermined final angle of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a particularly advantageous variant, a secondary grinding surface of the grinding wheel and drill bit are pivoted for its pointing in the area of the chisel edge relative to each other by a rake angle. This secondary grinding surface abuts the main grinding surface of the grinding wheel, and the chisel edge surface, i.e., the transition from the chisel edge to the clearance face, is ground with it. The profile of this surface relative to the longitudinal axis of the drill bit then gives the rake angle (the rake angle of the chisel edge). To realize the rake angle, the entire grinding wheel is pivoted relative to the longitudinal axis of the drill bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The pivoting movements by the pivot angle and by the rake angle are preferably superimposed on each other. The grinding wheel is therefore pivoted by two angles simultaneously. The pivoting movement by the pivot angle then occurs around a pivot axis that runs roughly radially outward from the chisel edge, and the pivot movement by the rake angle occurs around a pivot axis that runs roughly tangential to the chisel edge. As a result of the superimposition of these two pivoting movements, it is guaranteed that, on the one hand, a suitable pointing is achieved and, on the other hand, the ground surfaces transition into each other smoothly and uniformly. In particular, the chisel edge surface makes a smooth transition into the clearance face, i.e. it has no shoulders or ridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The rake angle is preferably set between a positive rake angle of &plus;5&deg; and a negative rake angle of &minus;5&deg;. The advantage of the method described above is particularly apparent in the realization of a positive rake angle, which can be achieved easily and without problems using the method described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To realize an appropriate drill bit geometry, the pivot angle is between 30&deg; and 60&deg;, and is in particular approximately 50&deg;. The angle of rotation is preferably between 60% and 90%, and is in particular approximately 80% of the final angle of rotation. This final angle of rotation is typically in a range between 90&deg; and 140&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To correctly grind the chisel edge, in one preferred variant the grinding wheel protrudes above the drill center at the beginning of the grinding process, so that the grinding wheel assumes an above-center grinding position. The drill bit and grinding wheel are then guided into a below-center grinding position, in which the grinding wheel ends before the drill center. The grinding of the clearance face, as well as pointing, can then be done in the below-center grinding position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The advantages and the particular embodiments above with respect to the method can be transferred and applied as appropriate to the drill tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The above-discussed embodiments of the present invention will be described further hereinbelow. When the word &ldquo;invention&rdquo; is used in this specification, the word &ldquo;invention&rdquo; includes &ldquo;inventions&rdquo;, that is the plural of &ldquo;invention&rdquo;. By stating &ldquo;invention&rdquo;, the Applicant does not in any way admit that the present application does not include more than one patentably and non-obviously distinct invention, and maintains that this application may include more than one patentably and non-obviously distinct invention. The Applicant hereby asserts that the disclosure of this application may include more than one invention, and, in the event that there is more than one invention, that these inventions may be patentable and non-obvious one with respect to the other.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Equivalent parts in the figures are identified by the same reference numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a twist drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that has been ground according to a method of the prior art (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and one that has been ground according to a method taught by an embodiment of the invention (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) are contrasted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has two major cutting edges <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are joined together via a roughly S-shaped chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The major cutting edges <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are depicted in wider lines for purposes of illustration. The cutting edges formed by the major cutting edges <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extend over the entire drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is designed to have mirror symmetry. The drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is explained below with reference to one of the two mirror-image sides, starting from the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Adjacent to it is a clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that extends to a flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> begins in the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and runs in a spiral pattern in the flute area <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adjacent to the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> adjacent to the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is designed essentially in the form of a conical surface. A surface referred to as the chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also extends from the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> transition into each other. The chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ground, in particular, during the pointing of the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the angular relationship between this surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set. The corresponding angle is referred to as rake angle &dgr; (cf. especially <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> During a grinding process of the prior art, the grinding wheel is reset in a second process step for pointing and is brought close to the chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, especially in the area in which the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> transitions into the second major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. To prevent contact between the grinding wheel and the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the main cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that has already been ground, a certain safety spacing must be maintained relative to these two cutting edges (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). In the ground drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, this separation is apparent in the fact that the chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a sharp bend or ridge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It extends into clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The clearance face is therefore bent at ridge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> toward flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Undesirably high mechanical loads during drilling are exerted on this ridge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, especially in the area of the chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> On account of the continuous three-dimensional grinding process according to the new grinding method, this ridge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is avoided in the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Instead, the chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes a smooth transition into the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and both extend to flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> without any sharp bends or ridges. It is also characteristic of the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is ground according to the new method, in addition to the ridge-free profile, that the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is curved from the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and has a radius of curvature R. This radius of curvature R is preferably between 0.05 and 0.5 times the drill diameter D. To illustrate the individual grinding areas, the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is divided into two differently shaded partial areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, partial area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A essentially representing the curved portion of the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also shown shaded as the third grinding area. All three grinding areas (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B) are ground in a continuous grinding process and make smooth transitions into one another. The outer line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> running on the periphery of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> forms with it in the area of the transition to flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (projected on the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) a pivot angle &agr;, which is preferably between 30&deg; and 60&deg; (for definition of pivot angle &agr;, also see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The grinding method taught by an embodiment of the invention is also explained in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in which the relative position between a grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown in a perspective view and in different grinding positions. The relative movement between drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is decisive for the three-dimensional grinding process described below. For the sake of simplicity, the grinding process is expressed either by movement of the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or by movement of the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It goes without saying that the corresponding movement can also be reasonably carried out by the other part. For greater clarity, only sections of the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown and are shaded in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to the initial position depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is aligned at an angle &agr;&prime; to a center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is 90&deg; at the beginning of grinding. The grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a ridge with a trapezoidal geometry, viewed in cross section, in which the one outside of the trapezoid is realized in the form of a main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the end surface adjacent to this side surface is realized in the form of a secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> transitions into the secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to form a curve. This curve essentially defines a rounded transition between chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The radial dimension of the main grinding wheel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is greater than the drill radius, so that it fully covers the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This ring-shaped grinding element sits with its trapezoidal base surface on a disk-like support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and forms the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with it. The grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is tightened by means of support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that it rotates as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is drawn through the tip of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., the drill center <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. It can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> that the main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> protrudes above the drill center <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the area of the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is therefore set above-center at the beginning of the grinding process. During the grinding process, the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then guided along an x-axis into a below-center position. The above-center initial position is used to grind the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is held approximately perpendicular to the peripheral line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of, the secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the beginning of the grinding process. The major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is ground at the beginning of the grinding process. The drill is then rotated around the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by an angle of rotation &bgr;, so that the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> adjacent to the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is ground. The major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as well as the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, slope outward from the drill center <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a radial component of the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are therefore sloped at an angle e to an imaginary cross sectional plane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (cf. also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In the vertical alignment of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> this angle C is determined by the trapezoidal angle &egr; between the main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the line perpendicular to the base surface of the trapezoid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition to the rotational movement around the angle of rotation &bgr; and the initial displacement along the x-axis, the drill bit is advanced in the direction of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> toward the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that the clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and indeed its tangential component, runs at an angle &lgr; obliquely to the imaginary cross sectional plane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The outside line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> therefore curves obliquely in the direction toward flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, starting from major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the center position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is situated relative to the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a below-center grinding position, i.e., the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> lies next to the secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Its peripheral line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> now runs roughly tangentially to the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The grinding process up to the depicted center position essentially corresponds to a conventional grinding process of the prior art. The new process is characterized by the fact that, starting from the center position, the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pivoted relative to main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the one hand, and relative to secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the other hand. Pivoting relative to main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> occurs by pivot angle &agr; around a main axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and pivoting relative to secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> occurs by rake angle &dgr; around a secondary axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. By pivoting by pivot angle &agr;, the angle &agr;&prime; between the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to pivot angle &agr; is reduced. This can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, from which it is apparent that the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is now aligned at all acute angle &agr;&prime; relative to center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, after having been originally aligned perpendicular to center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the beginning of the grinding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate more clearly the pivoting movement that is carried out between the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the transition from the center position to the end position. The grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in a schematic side view, again only in sections and by a broken line for the sake of clarity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a side view, in which the direction of viewing is essentially perpendicular to the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a side view in which the direction of viewing is approximately in the longitudinal direction of the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> that the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>runs at angle e to an imaginary cross sectional plane <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It can also be gathered that the peripheral line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> runs initially obliquely at angle &lgr; in the direction toward flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, beginning from the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and then has a curvature with a radius of curvature R. To form this curve, the grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pivoted with its main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> around the main axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by pivot angle &agr;. This angle is defined as the angle between the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the tangential component of the main grinding surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The grinding wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably pivoted simultaneously around secondary axis <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the rake angle &dgr; to form a rake angle in the area of chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A positive rake angle &dgr; of up to &plus;5&deg; is preferably set for chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ground by means of the secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so that it forms a type of overhang, as can be gathered from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The rake angle &dgr; establishes the angle between the secondary grinding surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Because of the fixed angular relationship between the two grinding surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the rake angle &dgr; is determined by the alignment of the radial component of the main cutting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> To summarize, the preferred grinding process can be broken down into the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 1. Beginning of the grinding process in an above-center grinding position at an angle of rotation &bgr; in which the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is aligned perpendicular to the center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (starting position, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 2. Movement of the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into a below-center grinding position along the x-axis. At the same time, there is an advance in the direction of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as well as a rotational movement around this axis up to an angle of rotation &bgr; of approximately 80% of the final rotation angle &ggr;. There can simultaneously be a translation movement of the drill along a y-axis which runs perpendicular to the x-axis. The x-axis and the center axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are parallel. (Center position, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Three movement components are therefore superimposed in the transition from the initial position to the center position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 3. Further rotation of the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to an end angle &ggr;, so that the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> executes a roughly 120&deg; rotation, beginning from the starting position. At the same time, there is a further advance in the direction of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as well as movement along the x-axis, and pivoting by pivot angle &agr;, as well as by rake angle &dgr;. A total of five movement components are therefore superimposed in the final working step until the end position is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Pivoting by the rake angle &dgr; as described in No. 3 above is optional here. The formation of a rake angle &dgr; is determined by the application for which the drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is intended. The method makes it possible to easily and very flexibly adjust the rake angle &dgr; easily and very flexibly. The decisive advantage of the method is seen in the fact that the grinding process is conducted in a continuous method, and a second setting of the grinding wheel with the necessary ridge-like transitions in the area of clearance face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and chisel edge surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected with this can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The drill <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is preferably designed in two parts as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and, for this purpose, has a drill base element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, having a recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on its end, into which the correspondingly designed drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be inserted, and specifically so that it can be replaced as necessary. The drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is secured in drill base element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, for example, by a clamping force exerted by two arms <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, or in addition, the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be fixed in the base element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a locking device (not shown). The flute <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> running in the drill base element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends into the drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This configuration, with a replaceable drill bit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, makes it possible to keep the operating costs for the drilling tools low, because the component that is exposed to the highest mechanical loads is realized in the form of a replaceable part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows the drill with the insert as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, with additional references. Specifically, the edges <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the flute portion of the drill bit insert are indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a view of one possible embodiment of a drill insert according to at least one possible embodiment of the present invention. The drill insert has similar features as the drill tip shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an additional partial area of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, designated as area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C. Areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C are both relatively flat surfaces. A rounded transition section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> between areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C is illustrated. The rounded section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> extends up to the chisel edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Another rounded transition section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> between areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C is also illustrated. This rounded section <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> also extends up to the chisel edge. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B has a slightly curved surface that curves upward to the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. The radius of curvature R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is substantially smaller than the radius of curvature R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> also shows the flute edges <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
