<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of manufacturing a catalytic converter is described where the catalytic converter is comprised of an outer tube member having a monolith substrate internally compressed therein with a wrapped mat material surrounding the monolith substrate and intermediate the outer tube. One or more monolith members can be applied within the outer tube and heat shields may also be applied internal to the outer tube and adjacent to the monolith substrate. The assembly of the catalytic converter includes measuring the sequence of compression of the mat material to the monolith substrate in order to understand the possible force characteristics which can be applied during the assembly thereof. The mat material is therefore compressed within the outer tube by way of compression jaws, by compression rollers, and/or by spinning. The compression of the mat material can be in single or multiple steps. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to the manufacturing of catalytic converters for automotive use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is common in automotive applications to require a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of automobiles, typically placed between the engine exhaust manifold and the muffler system of the automobile. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,686, the catalytic converter normally includes a monolith substrate, a mat material surrounding the monolith substrate, the monolith and mat material then being encapsulated in a metal enclosure which can be a cylindrical tube, a bipartite metal enclosure, or other round or non-round-type metal housing. It is also common to seal opposite ends of the mat material against the internal surface of the metal housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the requirements of the design is to have the mat material compressed between the outer metallic housing and the monolith substrate. Normal specifications of the catalytic converter require that a minimum pressure exists between the mat material and the monolith substrate, which retain the monolith substrate in place in the outer tube. At the same time, the specifications set a peak pressure on the monolith substrate during manufacture. The purpose of having a peak pressure is that a large force on the monolith substrate tends to fracture the substrate along a transverse face thereof. One of the difficulties in working with such substrates is that several different geometries exist, and different geometries have different fracture characteristics. Moreover, the monolith substrates have a tolerance in their diameter of &plus;3 mm to &minus;1 mm. Thus the deformation alone cannot be measured. Furthermore, it has not heretofore been possible to monitor the manufacturing process in light of such fracture characteristics to enable proper manufacturing of the catalytic converters with the proper load between the mat material and the monolith, without causing fracture of some of the monoliths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention then is to alleviate the shortcomings present in the market. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The objects of the invention have been accomplished by providing a method of manufacturing a catalytic converter comprised of an outer tube, a monolith substrate and a mat material surrounding the monolith. The method comprising the steps of establishing the fracture characteristics of the monolith substrate for the combination of the monolith substrate and mat material. A suitable compression sequence is then selected such that the monolith substrate will not fracture, and the mat material is placed around the monolith substrate. The combination of the mat material and monolith substrate is then inserted into the outer tube, and the combination of the outer tube, mat material and monolith substrate are compressed according to the compression sequence so that the monolith substrate is not fractured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the outer tube is radially deformed inwardly to compress the combination of the outer tube, mat material and monolith substrate. One method of radially deforming the tube is by compression swaging of the tube. A second method of radially deforming the tube is by spinning the combination of the outer tube, mat material and monolith substrate, to reduce the diameter of the outer tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In either of these alternatives, the mat material and monolith substrate can be partially compressed prior to the deformation step, so as to pre-load the mat material. The mat material and monolith substrate can be compressed together, and then moved longitudinally into the outer tube. This can be accomplished by radial compression at a compression station. Alternatively, the mat material and monolith substrate can be radially compressed by rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the process includes the further step of necking down the ends of the outer tube to a smaller profile. This can be accomplished by necking the ends down by spinning, such that the ends have diameters smaller than the profile of the remainder of the outer tube. Also preferably, and prior to the spinning step, funnel-shaped heat shields are inserted into opposite ends of the outer tube, and adjacent to the monolith substrate, and the outer tube is spun in order that the ends are spun down to substantially conform to the profile of the heat shield, and retain the heat shield in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing a catalytic converter comprised of an outer tube, a monolith substrate and a mat material surrounding the monolith, is manufactured by a process where the mat material is first inserted around the monolith substrate. The mat material is then partially and radially compressed against the monolith substrate. The combination of the mat material and monolith substrate is next inserted into the outer tube. Finally, the combination of the outer tube, mat material and monolith substrate are compressed together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the mat material and monolith substrate are together compressed, and then moved longitudinally into the outer tube. This can be accomplished in one of two ways. The mat material and monolith substrate can be radially compressed at a compression station, where substantially all of the mat material is simultaneously radially deformed. Alternatively, the mat material can be radially compressed by rollers, where the mat material and monolith substrate are moved longitudinally through a roller station, whereby the mat material is sequentially compressed as it moves through the rollers, and the combination of the mat material and monolith substrate are moved longitudinally into the outer tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The tube must also be compressed. The tube can be radially deformed by compression swaging. Alternatively, the tube may be radially deformed by spinning the combination of the outer tube, mat material and monolith substrate, to reduce the diameter of the outer tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The ends of the tube can also be necked down to a smaller profile, somewhat funnel-like. The ends of the tube may be necked down by spinning, such that the ends have diameters smaller than the profile of the remainder of the outer tube. Also in one embodiment, prior to the spinning step, funnel-shaped heat shields are inserted into opposite ends of the outer tube, and adjacent to the monolith substrate, and the outer tube is spun in order that the ends are spun down to substantially conform to the profile of the heat shield, and retain the heat shield in place.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an example of a catalytic converter manufactured according to the process of the present invention is shown generally at <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and includes an outer tube member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a monolith substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with end seal members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The catalytic converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also optionally include a first heat shield member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a necked-down section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby forming an internal air gap at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The catalytic converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also include a second heat shield member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a necked-down section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forming an air gap at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated to those skilled in the art that the mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can either be a stainless steel mesh-type material, or can alternatively be a nonflammable, fibrous-type material. In either case, the mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is compressible but, when compressed in the combination of the monolith <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, causes a force transfer from the mat material to the monolith substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and an equal reaction force against the inner wall of the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> force-vs.-time curve is depicted where the Y axis represents force transmitted between the mat to the monolith, whereas the X axis shows various times, that is, the time for the compression of the mat material (assuming the same depth of compression). Thus, the first curve C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>shows that, if the mat material is compressed quickly, that is, within T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>seconds, the peak force is reached quickly, that is, to F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, where F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>may be greater than the force required to shear the monolith substrate, or may cause a pressure higher than that allowed by the manufacturer. However, if the mat material is compressed over a longer period of time and to the same deformation, but within a longer period of time, that is, to T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>seconds, a lower peak force F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is reached. Finally, if the mat material is compressed to the same deformation over yet a longer period of time, that is, over T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>seconds, a peak force of F<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is reached. It should be appreciated that any number of times and deformations can be applied and accommodated, all dependent on the end result which is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, for every different monolith geometry, the peak force for fracturing of the monolith substrate may be measured such that the pressure against the monolith substrate in psi never exceeds a maximum threshold during manufacturing. For any given monolith substrate and manufacturing specifications, the cycle time can be minimized to the most efficient process. Also, according to the process described, the force and/or pressure can be measured, and the process is repeatable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, a common or typical manufacturing specification for a catalytic converter would require that a minimum pressure of 30 psi exist between the mat material and the monolith substrate after the completion of the manufacturing process, yet that during the manufacturing process, the peak pressure between the mat material and the monolith substrate never exceeds 100 psi. Thus, for this given manufacturing specification, and by knowing the fracture pressure according to the testing discussed in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the manufacturing process can be formulated such that the manufacturing time for compressing the mat material is held to a minimum, thereby reducing cycle time, yet ensuring that during the manufacturing process, the monolith never fractures or is subjected to a pressure higher than the set engineering specifications. It should also be understood that for any of the force curves C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, a multiple-step process is possible. In other words, the compression which takes place between the mat material and the monolith substrate can either be a one-step process or can be various steps, where the combination of the subcomponents are moved from station to station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a process according to one version of the invention will be described. With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> loading device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for loading the monolith substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> wrapped with the mat material will be described. The device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a central U-shaped loading section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for positioning of the outer tube, and includes gauge devices <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> mounted at opposite ends of the U-shaped loading section. The gauge devices shown generally at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will now be described, and it should be understood that the devices <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are identical but mirror images of each other, so that only one such device will be described. It should be understood that the gauge members will both assist in the insertion of the mat material and monolith in the outer tubes, but will also measure the force and/or pressure which the mat material is exerting on the monolith substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the gauge device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> generally includes a vertical platen portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a bracket portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which is attached to the platen <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and includes as a further extension thereof, the cylinder stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is positioned on the cylinder stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as will be described further herein. The device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, which, in the preferred embodiment, are disposed in a radial array around a tapered lead-in member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. With respect now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the insertion device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail. The bracket member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> includes a vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a U-shaped wall portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> having side wall portions at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes an opening at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which feeds into a tapered opening at <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and thereafter towards the pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as will be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With reference still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> could either be a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder, and includes a cylinder portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a rod portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a pusher section at <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. As shown, the pusher section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is positioned within the U-shaped wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and substantially axially aligned with the tapered opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Finally, the pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also include cylinder portions <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having a rod portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> operatively connected to rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that the rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are contoured with an arcuate shape (as best viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) such that with their radial alignment and the conformance of the arcuate shapes of the rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, are substantially profiled in a circular manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> spinning apparatus is generally shown at including chuck jaws <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which are common in the art of spinning. These chuck jaws move on a radial line so as to retain a circular member for spinning. The chuck head <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generally rotates in a clockwise position as viewed at the front of the head and as depicted by the rotational arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Meanwhile a pressure roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (held by a pressure arm, not shown) can be pressed against the outside of the contour of the tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for spinning purposes, and itself is held on a rotational axis and is a driven roller, not a drive roller. Pressure roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is movable along the longitudinal axis bi-directionally as depicted by the arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and is movable inward radially, thereby changing the diameter of the item being spun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a first method of producing a catalytic converter according to the present invention will be described. With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an outer tube, such as item <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which in this stage is simply a straight cylindrical tube, can be placed within the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such that the ends of the tube are aligned with lead-in members <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Monolith members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with wrapped mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are then placed within U-shaped wall members <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> aligning them with the cylinders <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. At this point, reference is again made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to recall that the speed of the deformation of the mat material will determine the force and pressure characteristics being placed on the monolith substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Thus, as should be appreciated, a control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will be included to control the speed of both the cylinder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and to record the force/pressure on the monolith. The pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are activated to cause inward radial movement of the various rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Input data, for example through cable <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, will be used to control the radial movement, and thus the compression. At the same time, output data will be gathered in the way of force data to ensure that the peak pressure is not exceeded, and to know the force which has been exerted, and the diameter at which this force was measured. This output data is fed forward to the control mechanism, and then to the spinning apparatus to ensure that the entire process is within spec. Input/output data will be used to both control and measure the cylinder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the resultant speed of the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and pusher member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Thus the speed of the pusher member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will determine how quickly the mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is compressed vis-&aacute;-vis the tapered opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and plurality of rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Further compression exists at the tapered members <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and during entry of the mat material into the outer tube member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Input/output data, for example through cable <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, both captures and controls the pressure exerted by rollers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. However, all of the compression and force characteristics of the monolith substrate can be predetermined such that the only variable to the process for control is the speed of the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, such that identical results are continuously reproduced in a manufacturing setting with commercially acceptable cycle times. This data is also fed forward to the control mechanism and thereafter on to the spinning apparatus. In this particular example, the combination of the mat material and the monolith are described to be further compressed upon insertion into the outer tube. It should be understood that it is immaterial whether or not the tube inner diameter is the same size as that compressed, smaller or larger. What is relevant, is the diameter to which the combination of the mat material and monolith are compressed, and the force/pressure at that point. This will be described further herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As can be viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, two monolith substrates are simultaneously inserted from opposite ends of the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> tube to position two monoliths adjacent to each other. However, it should be understood that the number of monolith members is immaterial to the invention, such that a plurality of monolith members could be inserted or a single elongate monolith substrate could be installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated at this point in the process cycle that the two monolith members are pre-installed and pre-stressed within the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and can be removed from the U-shaped member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and moved to the spinning apparatus depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. It should also be appreciated that, given the pre-stress between the mat material and the monolith substrate within the outer wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the mat material does not have the adequate pressure on the monolith and therefore the force of the mat material and the resultant pressure is only partially up the force curves C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. At the same time, while the complete force/pressure is not yet exerted, the input/output data from both the cylinder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and pressure roller assemblies <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has been fed forward to the control mechanism through respective cables <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and hence will control the remainder of the spinning process in accordance with the selected curve of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the combination of the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the monolith substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the mat material <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is inserted into the spinning apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and captivated within the jaws <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. According to the spinning process, then, the spinning head <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> begins to spin to its full speed, whereby the pressure roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> begins to exert pressure on the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the front end of the tube, that is, the tube end extending out of the head <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the spinning process can reduce the diameter of the outer tube from the diameter D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that is, its original diameter to diameter D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, as well as provide the constricted end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This entire process, both the radial depth as well as the axial speed, is accomplished according to the input data, fed forward from the control mechanism through cable <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that in the process step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that due to the fact that the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is chucked up within the spinning head <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the entire length of the outer tube cannot be spun in this step. Rather, after the tube is spun to approximately the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the spinning head <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is stopped, the partially spun outer tube is removed from the head and flipped around to insert the completed portion of the outer tube into the head, whereby the remainder of the outer tube is spun to the same dimension as that previously spun. It should also be appreciated that the spinning process, that is, taking the diameter from diameter D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to diameter D<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>also compresses the mat material between the outer tube and the monolith substrate. It should also be appreciated that the time of compression, that is, in accordance with the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> force vs. time of curve, is calibrated as it relates to the axial speed of the roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as it relates to the spinning process. Said differently, the faster the axial speed of the movement of the roller <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the spinning process will determine whether the force characteristics of the mat material on the monolith substrate follows curves C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, an alternate method of manufacturing the catalytic converter will be described. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the insertion mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> generally includes U-shaped tube holder <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and an insertion mechanism <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> mounted to opposite ends of the U-shaped holder <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The U-shaped holder generally includes a vertical platen <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, a bracket member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, a cylinder stand <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and a hydraulic cylinder <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The vertical platen <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> holds compression members <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> includes a pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> having rods <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> attached to semi-cylindrical pressure jaws <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. These pressure jaws are aligned with tapered lead-in members <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and with U-shaped tube holder <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> embodiment is also usable with the identical spinning mechanism <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> according to the following processing. An outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is first placed in the U-shaped holder <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and the cylinders <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> first move the monolith substrates and mat material into their respective compression jaws <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. When the monolith substrates are laterally aligned within the compression jaws <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, the cylinder <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is activated which causes a compression of the mat material surrounding the monolith substrate. Once again this compression and the time thereof is made in accordance with the selected compression sequence, that is, according to one of the illustrative curves C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. When the mat material is compressed to its proper position, the cylinders <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are again activated moving the monolith substrate through the tapered members <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and into the outer tube. At this point, the loaded outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and monolith members are moved to the spinning device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> and processed in the same manner as mentioned above. It should be appreciated that input/output data is again used in the manner as previously described with respect to the prior method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 14</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of the spinning process will be described, where internal heat shields such as items <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are desired internal to the outer tube. As first shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the heat shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the open end of the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjacent to a first monolith member to a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the spinning process can begin and spin the extended part of the outer tube such that a tapered portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is tapered to a substantial profile to that of the heat shield <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to conform thereto. As in previous spinning steps, the. partially completed spun outer tube is turned 180&deg; to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to receive the other heat shield member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is inserted into the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The spinning process continues to spin both the outer diameter of the outer tube as well as to spin tapered section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which lies adjacent to the heat shield <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With respect now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 17</cross-reference>, another possible method according to the invention is disclosed including a loading apparatus <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> including cylinder assemblies <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> arranged at opposite ends of bracket members <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, however, where no precompression by way of compression rollers or compression jaws takes place. Rather, the monolith members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are moved into the intermediate portion of outer tube member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, where the diameter D<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is slightly larger than D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The preassembly of outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; together with the monolith members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may now be moved to the spinning apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> and spun according to one of the force compression sequences disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It should be appreciated that, due to the fact that very little pre-stress is applied between the mat material and the monolith, all of the compression force, that is, the entire curve of force curves C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, will be applied by the spinning process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While the method is shown only with respect to round or cylindrical tubes, non-round tubes are also possible. In this case, the insertion apparatus would include a modified compression jaw similar to that shown with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, with compression jaws sized to conform to the non-round items. A further compression of the entire outer tube would also be used, where the incremental compression completes the mat compression cycle. This device could be used for either round or non-round tubes, and a round tube version is more particularly referred to in FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> With respect first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> gauge member <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is shown diagrammatically which receives a combination of the mat material and monolith <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> compresses the combination of the mat and monolith to a certain compression. This information, that is, the force exerted from the monolith back to the gauge dies as well as the diameter to which the combination of the mat material and monolith is compressed is fed to the control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This information is fed forward to shrinking dies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, whereby the combination of the mat material and monolith <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be placed within an outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and positioned within the shrinking dies <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Given the information fed forward from the gauge <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, that is, the pressure exerted on the gauge (which will coincide with the force exerted on the monolith material) together with a diameter to which the mat material has been compressed, and together with the specific force characteristic of the specific mat material used, the shrinking die <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can determine exactly to what further compression the combination of the outer tube <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> needs to be compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, three different mat materials were tested to determine to which dimension they need to be compressed in order to achieve a given force. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows the dimensions to which the <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mm mat material was compressed to achieve these various forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> also show estimated data for a particular mat material, where <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows the pressure versus time on the mat material given three different constant velocities of deformation. However, if the acceleration of the deformation decreases, for example, according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, then as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the peak pressure can be eliminated by decelerating the shrinking dies so as to totally eliminate the spike in a pressure curve of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. This deceleration is shown more particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, for any of the embodiments of the gauge members described above, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, the advantage is that the gauge station can measure the contraction or deformation to which the mat material is drawn, together with the force which is applied back to the gauge. As mentioned above, this force will be the same which is being exerted on the monolith itself. Thus, it is anticipated that the control mechanism <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will have pre-loaded data for each mat material to be used, for example, the data similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, and thus by gathering the data as mentioned above, and by comparison to the force curve, in order to achieve a certain force on the monolith, the added change in deformation will be known. As also mentioned above, the monolith substrates have a tolerance of &plus;3 mm to &minus;1 mm. It should be readily apparent why it is not acceptable to compress or deform the mat material and the monolith to a given diameter, as the variance of 4 mm in the diameter (that is, the tolerance range between the diameters of monolith substrates) being &plus;3 mm to &minus;1 mm) would lead to a drastic result in the force applied to the mat material and monolith substrate. The outer tube, monolith and mat material can thereafter be further radially compressed, by any of the spinning processes shown herein, or by the shrinking dies of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should be relatively apparent from the foregoing that the amount of deformation for each combination of mat material and monolith may be different. However, the method and apparatus described herein can accommodate every variation, and yet achieve the desired results of a given force or pressure on the monolith, with breakage. </paragraph>
