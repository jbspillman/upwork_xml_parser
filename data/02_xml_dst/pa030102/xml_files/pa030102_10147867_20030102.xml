<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An image forming apparatus includes a modulation data storage, a pulse width modulator, and an optical writing mechanism. The modulation data storage stores different gray-scale pulse sets. Each set includes gray-scale pulses having pulse widths different from each other in steps of a predetermined value corresponding to gray-scale information possibly contained in image data to be input. Each gray-scale pulse includes at least two pulses including at least one of left-positioned and right-positioned pulses. The pulse width modulator selects a gray-scale pulse set from among the different gray-scale sets in accordance with gray-scale information and performs a pulse width modulation to control a light beam on and off at a density twice or more than twice a density of the input image data by using the gray-scale pulse set selected. The optical writing mechanism causes the light beam to scan a photosensitive member to form a latent image thereon. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for image forming, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for image forming that is capable of effectively performing a light beam with a pulse width modulation using various gray-scale pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, electrophotographic is widely applied to an image forming apparatus such as a laser printer using a semiconductor laser. In this apparatus, the laser light beam is deflected with a polygon mirror to scan a surface of a photosensitive member, thereby forming a latent image of an object image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As an example of this type of apparatus, Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 08-018782 describes a multiple color information recording apparatus attempting to improve an image quality with a pulse width modulation (PWM) method. The PWM method controls a time period defined as a duty of an on-time of a laser diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, a technique is known which improves an image quality by increasing a recording resolution. In this technique, a laser diode is driven to emit laser light at a density more than twice an input image density, or a number of input pixels, in at least one of the main scanning and sub-scanning directions. In recent years, this technique is widely used to improve the image quality, in which the recording is performed at such a high resolution with a reduction of a number of gray-scale included in image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Generally, a dither method and an error diffusion method are used for a case where a gray-scale is expressed with binary image data, for example. The PWM method can also be used for such case. In the PWM method, a pulse is predefined with a certain width and a dot is formed using this pulse. In order to obtain a superior image quality, it is needed to select a pulse having the most preferable width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The PWM method can also be used for a case where a gray-scale is expressed with image data of a multiple value such as a four-stepped-value, an eight-stepped-value, and so forth. In the multiple value, the four-stepped-value has three levels of data, the eight-stepped-value has seven levels of data, and so forth. To each of these levels of data included in each multiple value, a pulse is predefined with a width. In this case, it is also needed to select a pulse having the most preferable width so as to obtain a superior image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A free selection of pulses is preferable to obtain a pulse having the most suitable width. However, it is difficult to predefine a pulse width by dividing it into relatively small steps, which increases a manufacturing cost, particularly in a case where a recording is performed at a relatively high resolution and at a relatively fast recording speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in an apparatus that generates, for example, eight different pulses including one-eighth, two-eighth, three-eighth, four-eighth, five-eighth, six-eighth, seven-eighth, and eight-eighth, a pulse having the most suitable width is required to be selected from among these eight different pulses relative to the data of each gray-scale. As a result, it produces a drawback that an image quality is not optimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In recent years, a red laser diode having a 650-nm-ranged wave length that is capable of reducing a spot size has been used as a light source in place of a laser diode of a 780-nm-ranged wave length to be able to perform a recording at a high resolution. However, this red laser diode has a characteristic that, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> start of an actual light emission indicated by a signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is delayed relative to a signal indicated by a signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for commanding the laser diode to start emitting laser light. Accordingly, laser light needed may not be obtained when the width of a pulse is predefined without adjusting the above-mentioned time delay. Consequently, this causes a problem that an image quality is degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Actually, when a recording is performed with a red laser diode, the pulses having widths at relatively low duty ratios are not usable depending upon a recording resolution or a recording speed. This leads to a problem that the narrow selection becomes more narrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 08-018782 describes a multiple color information recording apparatus capable of selecting a method of growing pulses with the pulse width modulation in accordance with input data and values of the neighboring pixels. Such an apparatus can select the positions of pulses but not solve the above-mentioned problem of the narrowed selection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> This patent specification describes a novel image forming apparatus that uses a pulse width modulation for controlling a scanning light beam in an optical writing system. In one example, a novel image forming apparatus includes a photosensitive member, a modulation data storage, a pulse width modulator, and an optical writing mechanism. The photosensitive member is written a latent image on a surface thereof. The modulation data storage stores a plurality of different gray-scale pulse sets. Each of the plurality of different gray-scale sets includes a plurality of gray-scale pulses having pulse widths different from each other in steps of a predetermined value which corresponds to gray-scale information including a plurality of gray-scale values possibly contained in image data to be input. Each of the plurality of gray-scale pulses is made of a combination of at least two pulses including at least one of left-positioned and right-positioned pulses. The pulse width modulator selects a gray-scale pulse set from among the plurality of different gray-scale sets stored in the modulation data storage in accordance with gray-scale information contained in input image data and performs a pulse width modulation to control a light beam on and off in accordance with the input image data at a density twice or more than twice a density of the input image data by using the gray-scale pulse set selected. The optical writing mechanism causes the light beam to scan the photosensitive member so as to form a latent image on the photosensitive member in accordance with the input image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The pulse width modulator may control the light beam on and off at a density twice a density of the input image data in a main scanning direction, or in a sub-scanning direction, or in both main scanning and sub-scanning directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each gray-scale pulse included in the gray-scale pulse set may be made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse and a left-positioned in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An input mechanism may be included for inputting information to predefine or to change each gray-scale pulse included in a gray-scale pulse set prestored in the modulation data storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A source of the light beam may be a red laser diode having a 650-nm-ranged wave length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The pulse width modulator in turn may perform the pulse width modulation for the input image data of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black colors. Also, the optical writing mechanism may in turn form the latent image of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black colors on the photosensitive member in accordance with the input image data of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black colors, respectively, by causing the light beam to scan the photosensitive member. In this case, the light beam is in turn controlled in accordance with the input image data of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black colors, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The predetermined value may be a one-eighth of a pixel of the image data to be input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This patent specification further describes a novel method of image forming that uses a pulse width modulation for controlling a scanning light beam in an optical writing system. In one example, a novel method includes the steps of storing, entering, selecting, performing, and controlling. The storing step stores a plurality of different gray-scale pulse sets. Each of the plurality of different gray-scale sets includes a plurality of gray-scale pulses having pulse widths different from each other in steps of a predetermined value in accordance with gray-scale information including a plurality of gray-scale values possibly contained in image data to be input. Each of the plurality of gray-scale pulses is made of a combination of at least two pulses including at least one of a left-positioned pulse and a right-positioned pulse. The entering step enters input image data. The selecting step selects a gray-scale pulse set from among the plurality of different gray-scale sets in accordance with gray-scale information contained in the input image data entered by the entering step. The performing step performs a pulse width modulation using gray-scale pulses included in the gray-scale pulse set selected by the selecting step to control a light beam on and off in accordance with the input image data at a density twice or more than twice a density of the input image data entered by the entering step. The controlling step controls the light beam to scan a photosensitive member to form a latent image on the photosensitive member in accordance with the input image data entered by the entering step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The performing step may perform the pulse width modulation to control the light beam on and off at a density twice or more than twice a density of the input image data in a main scanning direction, or in a sub-scanning direction, or in both main scanning and sub-scanning directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each gray-scale pulse included in the gray-scale pulse set may be made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse and a left-positioned in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned method may further include a step of inputting information to predefine or to change each gray-scale pulse of the plurality of gray-scale pulse sets prestored by the storing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A source of the light beam may be a red laser diode having a 650-nm-ranged wave length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The selecting step may select a suitable gray-scale pulse set from among the plurality of different gray-scale sets in accordance with gray-scale information contained in each of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black color image data included in the input image data entered by the entering step each time one of the yellow, magenta, cyan, and black color image data is processed one after another. In this case, the performing step performs the pulse width modulation using gray-scale pulses included in the suitable gray-scale pulse set selected by the selecting step to control the light beam on and off in accordance with each of the yellow, magenta, cyan, and black color image data. Then, the controlling step controls the light beam to scan a photosensitive member to form a latent image on the photosensitive member in accordance with gray-scale information contained in each of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black color image data included in the input image data entered by the entering step each time one of the yellow, magenta, cyan, and black color image data is processed one after another. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In describing preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> description is made for an electrophotographic image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. This image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a laser writing system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that employs an LD (laser diode) controlled to emit a laser beam in accordance with image data obtained from an original document through an image reading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for optically reading an image and that writes an image on a photosensitive member with the laser beam. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, particularly focusing on the laser writing system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereof. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the laser writing system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a charging unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a development unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a transfer unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a cleaning unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a discharging unit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided as an image carrying member on which an object image to be formed is drawn in a form of a latent image. That is, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is charged by the charging unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is then exposed to a light beam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> emitted from the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that a latent image is written on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided as a means of optically writing image information. In the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a laser beam emitted from an LD (laser diode) unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) provided as a light source is converted into parallel light rays with a collimate lens (not shown). Then, after passing through a cylinder lens (not shown), the parallel light rays are deflected by a polygon mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> rotated at a relatively high speed with a polygon motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, the parallel light rays are subjected to a sub-scanning direction focusing through an f&thgr; lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a barrel toroidal lens (BTL) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. With this sub-scanning direction focusing, a light gathering and a positional correction in the sub-scanning direction are performed. After the sub-scanning direction focusing, the parallel light rays are reflected by a mirror <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and become the laser beam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which scans the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> provided to the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is controlled in accordance with image data transferred from a frame memory or the image reading unit, both not shown. This control will be explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The development unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided as a unit for visualizing the latent image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with toner, and the transfer unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> transfers the visualized image onto a recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cleaning unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a unit for removing a residual toner remaining unused through a transfer process, the discharging unit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> discharges electronic charges from the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the charging unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> evenly charges the discharged surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With the above-mentioned units, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention performs the series of common electrophotographic processes including charging, exposing, developing, transferring, cleaning, and discharging processes and, after causing a sheet supply unit (not shown) to feed a recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, forms an image on the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> being transferred in a direction A with a transfer belt (not shown). The image formed on the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is fixed by a fixing unit (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, a control circuit of the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> further includes an LD (laser diode) controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a polygon motor drive controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a sync detection LD (laser diode) controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a write clock signal (WCLK) generator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a phase sync clock signal (VCLK) generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a mirror <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a sync detection sensor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the polygon motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the BTL <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the mirror <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are omitted to be shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The sync detection sensor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is arranged at a position close to a starting edge of a delta-like-shaped scanning area in the main scanning direction. The sync detection sensor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is configured to receive the light beam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which passes through the fO lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is reflected by the mirror <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and is brought to converge with the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> before impinging on the sync detection sensor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the light beam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the sync detection sensor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> outputs a detection pulse (DETP) to the VCLK generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The VCLK generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> generates a phase sync clock signal VCLK in synchronism with the detection pulse DETP, based on the write clock signal WCLK generated by the WCLK generator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the detection pulse DETP. The phase sync clock signal VCLK is sent to the LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates a beam drive signal BD in a high state in response to DETP and sends the beam drive signal BD to the LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which uses the beam drive signal BD in a high state to turn on the laser diode of the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Initially, the sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> keeps the beam drive signal BD in a high state until receiving the first DETP so that the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is continuously driven to emit the light beam until the detection of the first DETP. After receiving the first DETP, the sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> sends the beam drive signal BD in a high state to the LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based on the signals DETP and VCLK at a timing such that the signal DETP can securely be detected without generation of flare light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to turn on in response to a width of a pulse signal which is generated from image data sent from the image reading unit or the frame memory in synchronism with the signals BD and VCLK. When the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> turns on, it emits the laser light which, as described above, is converted into the laser beam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to scan the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The polygon motor drive controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> controls the polygon motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate at a predetermined rpm (revolutions per minute) using a control signal sent from a printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> controls the operations of the laser writing system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using a control signal sent from a controller (not shown) for controlling the entire operations of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further explained in detail below. The LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pulse width modulator for controlling the light beam to go on and out using a pulse width modulation. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the LD controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a PWM (pulse width modulation) signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a nonvolatile memory and is a modulation data storing means for storing various gray-scale pulses configured by combinations of right-positioned pulses and left-positioned pulses both having variations of various pulse widths, in response to each piece of gray-scale information included in image data, and by one of these right-positioned and left-positioned pulses. Also, in accordance with the gray-scale information included in the image data input, the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> selects and reads out a corresponding gray-scale pulse from among the gray-scale pulses stored, and sends it as a PWM signal to the LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> drives the laser diode of the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to emit the light beam in accordance with the PWM signal sent from the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the beam drive signal BD sent from the sync detection LD controller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. That is, the LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> causes the laser diode of the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to turn on in accordance with the gray-scale pulse or during a time of receiving the beam drive signal BD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that if the image data is binary data, having only on and off states, the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs a stored predetermined gray-scale pulse when the image data is in an on state. This on state of the image data is regarded as a kind of gray-scale information. In this case, the gray-scale pulse may be selected in response to the control signal sent from the printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Also, if the image data is multi-valued data, the gray-scale pulse corresponding to each of the gray-scale information may be altered by the control signal sent from the printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of the gray-scale pulse used in the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is explained. The image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is configured to write an image at a density of 1200 dpi in the main scanning direction and at a density of 600 dpi in the sub-scanning direction. On the other hand, input image data has a density of 600 dpi in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions. That is, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to cause the laser diode thereof to turn on and off at a density twice the density of the input image data in the main scanning direction. In addition, the smallest width of the PWM signal is defined as a width at a one-eighth duty ratio, that is, the smallest width is one-eighth of a full width capable of writing an image of one dot of image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, since the LD is controlled to turn on and off at a density twice the input image density in the main scanning direction, as described above, a gray-scale pulse made of a combination of two pulses in the main scanning direction may be used to write an image of one pixel of image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D show various examples of the above-mentioned gray-scale pulse. The gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> are made of the same two pulses combined. For example, a pulse A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of two combined left-positioned pulses having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio. A pulse A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of two combined left-positioned pulses having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio. For convenience sake, these positional characteristics of the pulses A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be expressed as L1/8&plus;L1/8 and L2/8&plus;L2/8, respectively. In a similar manner, pulses A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-A<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as L3/8&plus;L3/8, L4/8&plus;L4/8, L5/8&plus;L5/8, L6/8&plus;L6/8, L7/8&plus;L7/8, and 8/8&plus;8/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> are made of left-positioned and right-positioned pulses combined in this order. That is, a pulse B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio and a right-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio. A pulse B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio and a right-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio. As in the case of the pulses A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-A<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the pulses B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are expressed as L1/8&plus;R1/8 and L2/8&plus;R2/8, respectively. Similarly, pulses B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as L3/8&plus;R3/8, L4/8&plus;R4/8, L5/8&plus;R5/8, L6/8&plus;R6/8, and L7/8&plus;R7/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> are made of a single left-positioned pulse. For example, a pulse C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a single left-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio. A pulse C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a single left-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio. These pulses C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be expressed as L1/8 and L2/8, respectively. In a similar manner, pulses C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-C<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as L3/8-8/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Further, the gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> are made of left-positioned and right-positioned pulses combined in this order and which have different duties. For example, a pulse D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio and a right-positioned pulse having a width at an eight-eighth duty ratio. A pulse D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio and a right-positioned pulse having a width at a seven-eighth duty ratio. That is, these pulses D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be expressed as L1/8&plus;8/8 and L2/8&plus;R7/8, respectively. Similarly, pulses D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-D<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as L3/8&plus;R6/8, L4/8&plus;R5/8, L5/8&plus;R4/8, L6/8&plus;R3/8, L7/8&plus;R2/8, and 8/8&plus;R1/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Other than these pulses shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D, gray-scale pulses can be made of left-positioned and/or right-positioned pulses having variable widths at duty ratios from a zero-eighth duty ratio to an eight-eighth duty ratio in one-eighth steps. For example, gray-scale pulses can be made of right-positioned and left-positioned pulses in this order, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> are made of right-positioned and left-positioned pulses combined in this order and which have the same pulse width. For example, a pulse E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse and a left-positioned pulse both having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio. A pulse E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse and a left-positioned pulse both having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio. These pulses E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are expressed as R1/8&plus;L1/8 and R2/8&plus;L2/8, respectively. Similarly, pulses E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-E<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as R3/8&plus;L3/8, R4/8&plus;L4/8, R5/8&plus;L5/8, R6/8&plus;L6/8, R7/8&plus;L7/8, and 8/8&plus;8/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> By using the gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, an image of one dot of image data can be drawn in a single spot during a writing time for two consecutive dots in the main scanning direction. As a result, each single spot can be formed in a stable manner. In addition, the position of a spot to be drawn can easily be adjusted by a change of a ratio between duty ratios of the right-positioned pulse and the left-positioned pulse. For example, the gray-scale pulses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> are made of a combination of right-positioned and left-positioned pulses having a different duty ratio by a one-eighth pulse. That is, a pulse F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio and a left-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio. A pulse F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a right-positioned pulse having a width at a two-eighth duty ratio and a left-positioned pulse having a width at a three-eighth duty ratio. These pulses F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be expressed as R1/8&plus;L2/8 and R2/8&plus;L3/8, respectively. Similarly, pulses F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-F<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are defined and are expressed as R3/8&plus;L4/8, R4/8&plus;L5/8, R5/8&plus;L6/8, R6/8&plus;L7/8, and R7/8&plus;8/8, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In a comparison of the pulse A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, L4/8&plus;L4/8, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and the pulse B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, L4/8&plus;R4/8, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, for example, both pulses A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> drive the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to emit the light beam from the laser diode for a substantially equal time period. However, a time interval in which the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is turned off and is again turned on is different with these two pulses. As a result, images formed with the pulses A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the one-eighth pulse has a time width of 2 ns, for example, a case where a gray-scale dot may be drawn with the light beam of 6 ns, for example, can use one of the following ten variations based on a simple calculation for obtaining pulses having a width at three-eighth duty ratio. The ten variations are the pulses of a left-positioned one-eighth pulse combined with a left-positioned two-eighth pulse (L1/8&plus;L2/8) (not shown), a left-positioned one-eighth pulse combined with a right-positioned two-eighth pulse (L1/8&plus;R2/8) (not shown), a left-positioned two-eighth pulse combined with a left-positioned one-eighth pulse (L2/8&plus;L1/8) (not shown), a left-positioned two-eighth pulse combined with a right-positioned one-eighth pulse (L2/8&plus;R1/8) (not shown), a left-positioned three-eighth pulse only (e.g., the pulse C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, L3/8, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>), a right-positioned one-eighth pulse combined with a left-positioned two-eighth pulse (e.g., the pulse F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R1/8&plus;L2/8, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>), a right-positioned one-eighth pulse combined with a right-positioned two-eighth pulse (R1/8&plus;R2/8) (not shown), a right-positioned two-eighth pulse combined with a left-positioned one-eighth pulse (R2/8&plus;L1/8) (not shown), a right-positioned two-eighth pulse combined with a right-positioned one-eighth pulse (R2/8&plus;R1/8) (not shown), and a right-positioned three-eighth pulse only (R3/8) (not shown). However, these ten variations are different from each other in timing to turn off. Besides, the time the light beam is emitted may become shorter than a theoretical value as the pulse is thinner due to a rise time of each pulse. That is, in these ten variations, the time the light beam is emitted may not accurately be proportional to the duty ratio of the pulse. Therefore, these ten variations of pulses may form images in shapes slightly different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, gray-scale pulses suitable for gray-scale images which can be contained in image data are selected from among the above-mentioned variations through experiments and are previously stored in the nonvolatile memory of the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this process, the selection of the suitable gray-scale pulses should be made through visual examination and those in a superior quality are selected. In addition, it is preferable that an exposure energy to the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is previously measured on every possible selections and selection is made with reference to this measurement. Also, when a necessary energy for a gray-scale image is known such as when one gray-scale image requires an energy A, another gray-scale image requires an energy B, and so forth, the gray-scale pulse closest to such value may be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, in this embodiment, the gray-scale pulses suitable for image forming with respect to gray-scale information including four gray-scale steps from 0 to 3 are obtained through the experiments and are shown in Table <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> By using these gray-scale pulses, the PWM signal corresponding to one dot of image data can be selected from among various choices even when a number of the PWM signals to be generated to write one dot is relatively small. The PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs the above-mentioned gray-scale pulses as the PWM signals to the LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to drive the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Thereby, as a result, an image quality can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It may be possible that the gray-scale pulses are stored in a ROM provided to the printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or a control unit for controlling the operations of the entire apparatus and that the gray-scale pulses stored in such ROM are set to a memory of the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the memory of the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a nonvolatile memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, other examples of the gray-scale pulse used in the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D. As set forth, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is configured to have an image writing density of 1200 dpi in the main scanning direction and of 600 dpi in the sub-scanning direction. In this discussion, however, the image writing densities in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions are changed to 600 dpi and 1200 dpi, respectively, while the densities of input image data in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions remain 600 dpi. With this configuration, the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is controlled to turn the laser diode on and off at a resolution twice the input image density in the sub-scanning direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can use a gray-scale pulse made of a combination of two pulses in the sub-scanning direction to write an image of one pixel of image data. In other words, a pulse made of a combination of a pulse of a first line and a pulse of a second line can be used to write an image of one pixel of image data. More generally, a pulse made of a combination of a pulse of an nth line and a pulse of an (n&plus;1)th line can be used to write an image of one pixel of image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D show examples of these gray-scale pulses. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a pair of pulses G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a pair of pulses G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Each pair is made of at least two same pulses consecutive in the sub-scanning direction. That is, a pulse G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line is made of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio, which may be expressed as L1/8. A pulse G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line is also made of a left-positioned pulse having a width at a one-eighth duty ratio, which may be expressed also as L1/8. That is, the pair of the pulses G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a combination of two same pulses L1/8. In a similar manner, the pair of the pulses G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and G<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a combination of two same pulses L2/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Likewise, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows a pair of pulses H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a pair of pulses H<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and H<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Each pair is made of at least two symmetric pulses. That is, in one pair of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the pulse H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a fist line is made of a left-positioned three-eighth pulse, L3/8, and the pulse H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line is made of a right-positioned three-eighth pulse, R3/8. In the other pair of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the pulse H<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for a first line is made of a left-positioned four-eighth pulse, L4/8, and the pulse H<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for a second line is made of a right-positioned four-eighth pulse, R4/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It may also be possible to use a pair of pulses made of a single pulse, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. That is, in a pair of pulses J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and J<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the pulse J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a left-positioned fifth-eighth pulse, L5/8, and the pulse J<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a null pulse. Likewise, in a pair of pulses J<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and J<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the pulse J<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a left-positioned six-eighth pulse, L6/8, and the pulse J<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is null. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference> shows a pair of pulses K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a pair of pulses K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-and-K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pair, each pulse is made of at least two pulses having widths at duty ratios different from each other. That is, the pulse K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a fist line is made of a left-positioned one-eighth pulse, L1/8, and a pulse K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line is made of a left-positioned two-eighth pulse, L2/8. In the K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-and K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> pair, each pulse is made of at least two symmetric-like pulses having widths at duty ratios different from each other. That is, the pulse K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for a first line is made of a left-positioned three-eighth pulse, L3/8, and the pulse K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for a second line is made of a right-positioned four-eighth pulse, R3/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Other than these pulses shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D, gray-scale pulses can be made of left-positioned and/or right-positioned pulses having variable widths at duty ratios from a zero-eighth duty ratio to an eight-eighth duty ratio in one-eighth steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In a comparison of the gray-scale pulses made of a combination of two consecutive pulses in the sub-scanning direction, such as a left-positioned three-eighth pulse, L3/8, and a right-positioned three-eighth pulse, R3/8, for example, both pulses of L3/8 and of R3/8 drive the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to emit the light beam from the laser diode for a substantially equal time period. However, a time at which the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is turned on to emit the light beam is different with these two pulses. As a result, images formed with the pulses of L3/8 and of R3/8 are different from each other. In addition, the time the light beam is emitted is prone to be shorter than a theoretical value as the pulse is thinner due to a rise time of each pulse and is therefore not accurately be proportional to the duty ratio of the pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the embodiment explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B, gray-scale pulses suitable for gray-scale dots are defined through experiments and are previously stored in the nonvolatile memory provided to the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs such gray-scale pulses as PWM signals to the LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to drive the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In this way, an image quality can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In this case, the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled to output a pulse of a first line part of a gray-scale pulse as the PWM signal so as to write a first line part of a pixel of image data and to output a pulse of a second line part of the gray-scale pulse as the PWM signal so as to write a second line part of the pixel of the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Next, other examples of the gray-scale pulse used in the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E. As set forth, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is initially configured to have an image writing density of 1200 dpi in the main scanning direction and of 600 dpi in the sub-scanning direction. In this discussion, however, the image writing densities in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions are both set to 1200 dpi, while the densities of input image data in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions remain 600 dpi. With this configuration of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is controlled to turn the laser diode on and off at a resolution twice the input image density in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses a gray-scale pulse made of a combination of two pulses in each of the main scanning and sub-scanning directions to write an image of one pixel of image data. That is, a total sum of four pulses can be used. In practice, a gray-scale pulse of the present embodiment is made of a combination of a pulse for a first line part made of one of the gray-scale pulses of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and a pulse for a second line part made of one of the gray-scale pulses of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. More generally, a gray-scale pulse of the present embodiment is made of a combination of a pulse for an nth line part made of one of the gray-scale pulses of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and a pulse for an (n&plus;1)th line part made of one of the gray-scale pulses of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. The thus-made gray-scale pulse can write an image of one pixel of image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E show examples of these gray-scale pulses. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a pair of a pulse L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line part and a pulse L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line part, both having at least two same pulses. That is, each of the pulses L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of two left-positioned one-eighth pulses, L1/8&plus;L1/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Likewise, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a pair of a pulse M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line part and a pulse M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line part, both having at least two symmetrical pulses. That is, each of the pulses M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned two-eighth pulse and a right-positioned two-eighth pulse, L2/8 &plus;R2/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> shows a pair of a pulse N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line part and a pulse N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line part, having at least two approximately symmetrical pulses with different duty ratios. That is, each of the pulses N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned three-eighth pulse and a right-positioned four-eighth pulse, L3/8 &plus;R3/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> shows a pair of a pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line part and a pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line part, having at least two approximately symmetrical pulses with different duty ratios. That is, the pulse P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned four-eighth pulse and a right-positioned five-eighth pulse, L3/8 &plus;R5/8. The pulse P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned five-eighth pulse and a right-positioned six-eights pulse, L5/8&plus;R6/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</cross-reference> shows a pair of a pulse Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a first line part having at least two approximately symmetrical pulses with different duty ratios and a pulse Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for a second line part having at least two symmetrical pulses. That is, the pulse Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned six-eighth pulse and a right-positioned seven-eighth pulse, L6/8&plus;R7/8. The pulse Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of a combination of a left-positioned seven-eighth pulse and a right-positioned seven-eights pulse, L7/8&plus;R7/8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Other than these pulses shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E, gray-scale pulses can be made of a combination of pulses for first and second line parts using left-positioned and/or right-positioned pulses having variable widths at duty ratios from a zero-eighth duty ratio to an eight-eighth duty ratio in one-eighth steps. In the combination, the pulses for the first and second line parts may be different from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As in the foregoing cases, gray-scale pulses suitable for gray-scale dots are defined through experiments and are previously stored in the nonvolatile memory provided to the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> outputs such gray-scale pulses as PWM signals to the LD driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to drive the LD unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In this way, an image quality can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In this case, the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled to output a pulse of a first line part of a gray-scale pulse as the PWM signal so as to write a first line part of a pixel of image data and to output a pulse of a second line part of the gray-scale pulse as the PWM signal so as to write a second line part of the pixel of the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For example, in this embodiment, the gray-scale pulses suitable for image forming with respect to gray-scale information including four gray-scale steps from 0 to 3 are obtained through the experiments and are shown in Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In an image forming apparatus capable of changing a writing resolution depending upon a mode of image forming, the image writing in a normal paper mode, for example, may be performed using the gray-scale pulses indicated in Table 2 at a resolution twice a density of input image data in the main scanning direction. In a thick paper mode, for another example, the image writing may be performed using the gray-scale pulses indicated in Table 2 at a resolution twice a density of input image data in both main scanning and sub-scanning directions, wherein an amount of the light beam should be set to that in the normal mode multiplied by 0.95. In this way, it is possible to improve an image quality in both normal and thick paper modes and also to make the image qualities in these two modes closer and closer to each other. Thus, defining suitable gray-scale pulses depending upon the modes of image forming may be of advantageous.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, a modified configuration of the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this modified configuration, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with an operation panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The operation panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes keys or a touch-sense panel for inputting alphanumerical characters, for example, to specify a preferable mode of image forming. The operation panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be combined with a console panel for controlling the entire operations of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> After storing the various gray-scale pulses corresponding to the gray-scale information with respect to the image data into a re-programmable nonvolatile memory such as an EEPROM, a user may input or change data of a desired gray-scale pulse through the operation panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Such a re-programmable nonvolatile memory may be provided to the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described above, or it may be provided to the printer controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or a controller for controlling the entire operations of the apparatus so that the data of the gray-scale pulses can be transferred to the memory of the PWM signal generator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on an as needed basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable to provide a communications unit for exchanging data with a host system such as a personal computer to the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the data of the gray-scale pulses can be changed in accordance with information input from the host system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> With the thus-arranged configuration, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is capable of easily adjusting an image quality and also specifying suitable gray-scale pulses in response to an event that performance characteristics of key components such as a photosensitive member, a light-emitting element, toner, and so on are changed or degraded by replacement of such key components, for example. Thus, the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can maintain a superior quality of the image forming feature for a relatively long time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, a color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a main portion of the color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with four of the laser writing systems <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in use for yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (B) colors. In this color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is conveyed in a direction C by a transfer belt <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is rotated by a transfer roller <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and a transfer motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and four times of image forming processes using the above-mentioned four colors are in turn performed relative to the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As a result, a complete color image composed of the four overlaying color images is formed on the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> During this process, the aforementioned gray-scale pulses made of a combination of at least two pulses are used to control the laser diode to turn on and off so as to form each color image in a superior quality. Therefore, a complete color image composed of the four overlaying color images has a superior quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to define gray-scale pulses in a way different from one color to another. This arrangement is useful particularly for a case where an electrostatic latent image and a toner image have a relationship of image density different from one color to another. That is, the gray-scale pulses suitable for each color can be used in an image forming process for each color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, a color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> adopts the laser writing system having a single photosensitive member. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes the image reading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the charging unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the discharging unit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which are the components same as those used in the image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> further includes a development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a photosensitive member cleaning unit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, an intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, a belt drive roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a belt transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, a belt supporting roller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, a sheet transfer unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and a belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> develops a latent image of each color image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> using a corresponding color. For this, the development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is provided with development sleeves <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>for rotating so as to make development agents having yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (B) colors in contact with the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> where an electrostatic latent image is formed. The development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is further provided with a development paddle (not shown) for rotating in order to mix the development agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive drum cleaning unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a cleaner for cleaning the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a way similar to that the cleaning unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a member for temporarily carrying a toner image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by the development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is extended with tension around the belt drive roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the belt transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and the belt supporting roller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and is driven by a drive motor (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The sheet transfer unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> transfers the toner image carried on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> onto the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and is provided with a sheet transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a moving mechanism (not shown) for making the transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in contact with the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on demand. The belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> removes the residual toner left on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> after the transfer process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> forms an electrostatic latent image by writing an image on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with the optical unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in accordance with image data of an image read through the image reading unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this operation, the color image is formed in an order of black, cyan, magenta, and yellow colors. However, the order of colors can be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Upon starting the image forming operation, the image data of black color is first used to form a latent image of black color. Then, in order to start developing the latent image of black color from the leading edge thereof, the development sleeve <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>is started to rotate before the leading edge of the latent image of black color is brought to a development position of the development unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The latent image of black color is then developed with the black toner. After that, the development of the black color image is stopped when the trailing edge of the latent image of black color is brought out of the development position. This stop of the development of the black color image is carried out at least before the leading edge of the latent image of cyan color is brought to the development position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The black toner image formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is transferred onto the surface of the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> rotated at the same speed as that of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This transfer is carried out by making the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> in contact with the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and applying a predetermined voltage to the belt transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> After that, the images of cyan, magenta, and yellow colors are in turn formed in a similar manner on the surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and are transferred one after another onto the surface of the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. That is, the cyan toner image overlays the black toner image, the magenta toner image overlays the cyan toner image, and the yellow toner image overlays the magenta toner image. Thus, a color image made of the four color toner images is generated on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Upon making such a color image made of the four color toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the sheet transfer unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> transfers the color image at a time onto the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> conveyed in a direction D by a sheet transfer belt (not shown). The recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> carrying the color image thereon is conveyed to a fixing mechanism (not shown) which melts and fixes the color image to the surface of the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the above process, the conveyance of the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is timed to a motion that the leading edge of the color image generated on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is brought to a sheet transfer position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The sheet transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sheet transfer unit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is usually not in contact with the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and is brought into a position to press via the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by pressure from the moving mechanism during the time the color image made of the four color toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is transferred onto the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the way as described above. When moved to the position to press the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> via the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the sheet transfer bias roller <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>applies the predetermined voltage to the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the transfer of the color image from the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> onto the recording sheet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is performed. In addition, the belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is also provided with a moving mechanism (not shown) that brings a cleaning blade (not shown) of the belt cleaning unit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> away from the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> during the time the intermediate transfer belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> carries the color toner images thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In this color image forming apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the gray-scale pulses made of at least two combined pulses, as described above, are used in accordance with the densities of image data and resolution so as to form an image in a superior quality. In this instance, gray-scale pulses differing from a color to another are predefined and applied according to colors when a relationship between the image densities of an electrostatic latent image for a toner color and a corresponding color toner image is different by color of the toner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As discussed in the background section, a red laser diode having a 650-nm-ranged wave length has recently been used as a source of light beam in use for an image forming apparatus. In comparison with a conventional laser diode of a 780-nm-ranged wave length, the red laser diode of a 650-nm-ranged wave length is advantageously capable of reducing a spot size and is therefore useful for a case where a high resolution image forming is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the red laser diode has a characteristic that emission of light beam has a delay relative to a time of receiving a signal for instructing a light emission to the laser diode. Therefore, a pulse of a relatively low duty ratio may actually not be used depending upon a solution or a recording speed. Further, a proportional relationship between a time that the light beam is turned on and a duty ratio of a pulse is largely collapsed. With these adverse effects, however, the gray-scale pulses provide a variety of pulse selections and are therefore capable of being used to form images in a superior quality, corresponding to various gray-scale values included in the image data. Accordingly, it is particularly effective to apply the present invention to an image forming apparatus adopting a laser writing system using the red laser diode having 650-nm-ranged wave length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned examples, the laser diode is driven by the signal at a density twice an input image density in at least one of the main scanning and sub-scanning directions. However, the ratio of the writing density is not limited to twice an input image density and can be any integer greater than two. For example, when the ratio of the writing density is defined as a number n greater than two, suitable gray-scale pulses may be defined with a combination of n pulses. Duty ratios of the gray-scale pulses in the main scanning and sub-scanning directions may differently be defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Further, in the aforementioned examples, the duty ratio of the pulse to generate the gray-scale pulses is changeable in one-eighth steps. However, other steps such as one-fourth, one-sixth, etc., can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Numerous additional modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the disclosure of this patent specification may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> This patent specification is based on Japanese patent application No. JPAP2001-149731 filed on May 18, 2001 in the Japanese Patent Office, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
