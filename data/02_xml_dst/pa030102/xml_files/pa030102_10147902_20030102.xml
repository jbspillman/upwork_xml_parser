<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement in a collapsible frame support frame, particularly for ironing boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the invention concerns an ironing board having a Z-shaped support, providing technical solutions sufficient to guarantee an optimum operation and absolutely under safety conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As it is well known, they have been suggested in the past, with a very wide diffusion in the market, X-shaped collapsible ironing boards, that, even quite satisfying under many points of view, are quite heavy, bulky and complicated to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, some solutions providing a Z-shaped frame have been suggested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A particularly advantageous solution is that suggested in the utility model patent application No VR96U000015, filed on Jul. 9, 1996 in the name of Axana S.r.l., and concerning collapsible support frame, particularly for ironing boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Main object of the above-mentioned patent application was that of providing a collapsible support frame very light and comprised of a reduced number of components, and that was easily collapsible and erectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object was that the collapsible support frame was manufactured with competitive prices and thus was advantageous even under the economical point of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other objects were reached suggesting a collapsible support frame, particularly for ironing boards, comprising a ground bearing base, an arm having one end linked with the bearing base and the other end that can be restrained to the ironing board, so as to be erectable in a working position, in correspondence of which it supports the ironing board at an operative level above and far from the bearing base, and a rest position, in correspondence of which it is collapsed against the bearing base, and blocking removable means acting both on the arm and on the bearing base and on the ironing board to maintain said arm in the working position at an adjustable level above the bearing base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in said utility model application, stop means are described comprising automatic means for erecting and collapsing said frame between the rest position and the working position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The solution according to the previous utility model patent application, even if valid under a technical point of view, has some problems that do not allow a valid and safe technical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Particularly, some problems have been noted in the support system allowing to maintain erected a Z-shaped structure as described in the previous utility model patent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, some studies have been made allowing its use under maximum safety conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another problem noted is that concerning the possibility of easily moving and putting back the ironing board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, the Applicant has developed a technical solution allowing to solve the above-mentioned problems, thus allowing to have an absolutely &ldquo;in the van&rdquo; ironing board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is therefore specific object of the present invention a collapsible support frame, particularly for ironing boards, comprising a ground bearing base, at least an arm having one end linked with the bearing base and the other end that can be restrained to the ironing board, and blocking removable means acting both on the arm, or on the arms, and on the bearing base, and on the ironing board to maintain said arm erected in a working position at an adjustable level above the bearing base, wherein said blocking removable means comprise at least two strut elements, one of which has its end articulated, when used, respectively one to said arm, or arms, and the other one to said bearing base, while the other strut element is articulated, when used, to said arm, or arms, and to the ironing board, and locking removable means to lock the position of said strut elements, each strut element comprising a plurality of plate-shaped element, packed by the interposition of a friction spacing element between two adjacent plate-shaped elements, and each one providing one end articulated to the arm or arms or to the bearing base, or to the ironing board, the other end provided with a slot for the loose articulation, to the bearing base or to the ironing board, or to the arm, or arms, respectively, and said locking removable means providing a tension rod, axially slidably mounted, and acting to engage the slots and to pack said plurality of plate-shaped elements, elastic means to load the tension rod, and an operation device, suitable to neutralise, upon activation, the elastic loading force of the tension rod, thus allowing the sliding displacement each other between plate-shaped elements and tension rod, said collapsible frame being characterised in that the plurality of plate-shaped elements of each element is comprised of a group of sliding plate-shaped elements and of a group of friction plate-shaped elements, each group of sliding plate-shaped elements providing at least 7 elements and each one of group of friction plate-shaped elements providing at least 8 elements, each group of plate-shaped elements of each strut element providing elastic means for packing the plate-shaped sliding elements and the plate-shaped friction elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, according to the invention, said plate-shaped friction elements are realised by block moulds, thus obtaining a perfect planarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Particularly, said plate-shaped elements are comprised of iron C70, with a single trimming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still according to the invention, said plate-shaped sliding elements are comprised of iron, subjected to tumbler system galvanisation, thus eliminating the punching burrs. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a frame according to the invention is shown, the main features of which are those of a specific embodiment of the previous utility model patent application No VR96U000015. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is shown an erectable and collapsible frame, which is generically indicated by the reference number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for an ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, comprised of a frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for example comprised of light alloy or of a suitable synthetic material, that can have a rectangular configuration and provided in correspondence of its angles with a ground bearing foot <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, advantageously of the height adjustable kind, for example by screwing. Frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is oriented in such a way to have its long sides substantially parallel to the long lateral sides of the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> One arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provides one end coupled with the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and one end coupled with the frame <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the solution shown, struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are kept in an erected position by two packs of plates or blades: an upper one <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between a blocking device, that is generically indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, under the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an upper transverse one <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and a lower group of plates or blades between transverse lower element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a locking device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supported by the bearing base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the following it will be described in greater detail the lower blocking device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the bearing base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, being provided that the blocking device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> above the struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is realised in function of, and in an analogous way with respect to the blocking device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each blade or plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides one end articulated to a respective transverse element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, while its other end is coupled to a slot (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), that is loose sliding coupled on a pin or tension rod <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided parallel to the transverse elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. Pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is slidably mounted on two spaced support brackets, or on a ear <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> an a U-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, welded, or coupled in another way, to a support plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, supported by the bearing base <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The tension rod or pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends between the two flaps of the U-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, said tension rod or pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an hexagonal head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> acting as abutment for an elastic loading element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, e.g. a rubber ring that, on one side abuts against the hexagonal head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and on the other side against the flat bottom of the U-shaped <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In correspondence of its free end, the hexagonal head <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> slidably abuts against a cam <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, rotating mounted on the flaps of the U-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. One end of the cam <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is fixed to a hand actuated or pedal actuated lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to control the cam <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The plates <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> pack is mounted on the pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by safety washers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> kept pushed against the bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by pack pushes against the bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a nut <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> screwed on the pin <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> within the bracket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By this arrangement, the plate pack <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is normally maintained blocked by the blocking force of the elastic locking means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while once the pedal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is actuated, pedal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will cause the squeezing of the elastic means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus the release of the plates <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that they can slide along the pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the elastic element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be comprised of opposed springs, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To erect the collapsible frame according to this example of realisation it must before squeeze the lower pedal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then the struts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are lifted, with the ironing board bearing on them. Once reached the wished level to operate on the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, pedal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is released, so that plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be blocked. Then, lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pushed on the side of the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is placed in a horizontal position, afterward the lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is released, so that the ironing board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is erected to work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> To collapse the frame it is obviously necessary to operate according to a contrary sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Observing now <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is particularly shown the plate pack <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> realised according to the invention, providing eight sliding plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and nine friction plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. It is further provided a spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> keeping packed the sliding plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the friction plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Sliding plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> could be seven and the friction plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> could be eight. Higher is the number of plates and higher are the blocking features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On the lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a pedal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided, said pedal <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being shaped in such a way to require a semi-rotation to release the plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Acting on the spring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the same is compressed, thus releasing the compression of the plates <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and allowing the sliding for the closure (or opening) the table <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Observing now also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, it can be observed the lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> providing, in the pushing point of the spring, a curved part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
