<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to preferred embodiments of the present invention, example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a financial service system according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of customer computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contact a financial service server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via a communication network such as an Internet. The financial service server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a main account database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a sub account database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a lottery management portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and an exchange rate processing portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> gives a user (i.e., depositor) a non-interest compound function saving account <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, also known as a refundable lottery-money saving account as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> when a user becomes a membership of the financial service server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The non-interest compound function saving account <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and a ranking/lottery-money information <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is an account used to perform a lottery. The balance of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> cannot be drawn out since it is regarded as an installment deposit unless the client terminates the non-interest compound function saving account <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and the lottery ticket number is given to the balance of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. However, when the lottery for the money deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is performed by a predetermined number of times, the deposit money of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is regarded as a balance which can be drawn out and can be transferred to the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> by the client. Even though the deposit money of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is regarded as the balance which can be drawn out, the lottery ticket number is given to the deposit money until the deposit money is drawn out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is a common account. The balance of the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be withdrawn at any time, and a common transaction such as a remittance, an account transfer, and a use of an automatic teller machine (ATM) is possible in the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Various functions can also be added to the sub account. However, the lottery ticket number is not given to the balance of the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The ranking/lottery-money information <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is managed by a drive manager <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> by using an ID and a password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The main account database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> stores a main account information of respective customers. The sub account database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> stores a sub account information of respective customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The lottery management portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> performs a lottery. The account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines whether the user draws a winning number or not, and manages a winning money. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The exchange rate management portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> applies a foreign exchange rate to a foreign money when the foreign money is deposited. When an exchange rate is 1,298 won per one dollar and 1,000$ is deposited, the exchange rate management portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> exchanges 1,000$ for one million two hundred ninety eight thousand (1,298,000) won. Therefore, if it is assumed that one lottery ticket number is given per one hundred thousand won, one million two hundred thousand won is deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the ninety eight thousand won is deposited in the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and 12 lottery ticket numbers are given to the depositor. The exchange rate management portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also processes an exchange rate when won is exchanged for dollar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating a financial service method according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The financial service method according to the present invention is described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A user can use the financial service according to the present invention after joining the financial service server <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a membership. When a user joins the financial service server, the account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> gives the user a non-interest compound function saving account <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> having the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). The main account information and the sub account information are stored in the main account database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the sub account database <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The lottery management portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> confers a lottery ticket number to the depositor and determines a lottery period (step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). Here, when a predetermined amount of money is deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the lottery ticket number per a predetermined amount of money is conferred as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, one lottery ticket number per one hundred thousand won is given. For example, when one million won is deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, ten lottery ticket numbers are given to the depositor. However, when a monthly amount of sales money is less than one hundred billion won, the lottery can be limited to once a month. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The lottery management portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> performs a lottery for the money deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> according to the lottery ticket number and the lottery period (step S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). Preferably, the lottery is performed twice a month on the first day and the 16<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>day. However, a lottery for a first month is preferably performed one time on the 16<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>day of the second month. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The lottery result for a deposit money of the first half of the month is announced on the first day of the next month, and the lottery for a deposit money of the second half of the month is announced at the 16<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>day of the next month. However, when the first day and the 16<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>day are holiday, an announce of the lottery result falls on the next day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines whether the user draws a winning number or not (step S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). When the user does not draw a winning number, it is determined whether the lottery is performed by a predetermine number of times (e.g., twice) or not (step S<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). The deposit money that underwent the lottery of the predetermined number of times is regarded as a balance which can be withdrawn from the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). For example, among the deposit moneys of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the deposit money that underwent the lottery twice can be withdrawn at any time. When the deposit money does not undergo the lottery of the predetermined number of times, the step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is performed until the lottery is performed by the predetermined number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A predetermined amount unit of money, e.g., one hundred thousand won, can be transferred between the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In this case, a multiple of one hundred thousand won is deposited in the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. But, a money of a won unit can be deposited in the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The withdrawal method follows a firs-in-first-out method similar to a current financial system. The lottery opportunity for a deposit money is continuously given to the client twice a month until the deposit money is drawn out of the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, whereupon the client can have a lottery opportunity automatically and the financial company has an advantage of a long-term deposit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> On the other hands, when the user draws a winning number, the account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines whether the winning money is less than a predetermined amount of money (e.g., one million won or ten million won) per one person or not (step S<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). When the winning money is less than the predetermined amount of money, the winning money is immediately paid in cash to the sub account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>). However, when the winning money is greater than the predetermined amount of money, the winning money is deposited in the predetermined account <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> during a predetermined time period and then the principal and interest is paid when the time period is expired (step S<highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>). The time period depends on an amount of the winning money. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the account management portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines whether the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has the balance or not (step S<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). When the main account <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has the balance, the lottery is performed in the method described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a system operating mechanism (SOM). The financial service system that seeks for Pareto-Optimum can be managed efficiently by the SOM of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A sales money of a lottery and a balance are managed by the system operating mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is assumed that a lottery is performed one time in an initial month, the lottery is performed by twice a month on and after the next month, and the deposit money that undergoes the lottery twice is regarded as a balance which can be with drawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> benefit of a financial company can be drawn by the following formula: </paragraph>
