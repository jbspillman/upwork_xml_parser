<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a multilayer printed wiring board used in the electric and electronic fields and, more particularly, to a multilayer printed wiring board exhibiting excellent properties at high frequencies and having excellent mechanical strength. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electronic instruments such as portable telephones, various types of audio-visual instruments and personal computers have been developed and are used in the ordinary living, penetrating deeply into the life style. Printed wiring boards are widely used in these electronic instruments as the fundamental members. For these printed wiring boards, it is required that speed of transfer of electronic signals be fast so that speed of operation in electronic circuits increases and loss of electronic signals in transfer be small so that formed energy loss decreases. These properties are deeply related to electric properties of resins forming major portions of the printed wiring boards. More particularly, magnitudes of permittivity and dielectric loss of the resins greatly affect the speed of transfer and the loss of electric signals in transfer and it is desired that values of these properties in high frequency regions are held as small as possible. Resistance to soldering and heat resistance which are required in the preparation of electronic members and mechanical properties such as strength which are required for molded articles are also important factors required for the resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, fluororesins, epoxy resins, polyolefins resins such as polyethylene and the like, polyarylene sulfide resins and the like resins have been used as the above resins. However, these resins have drawbacks in that fluororesins have a poor property for injection molding and are expensive, epoxy resins have insufficient electric properties and polyolefins resins have poor heat resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is required that printed wiring boards exhibit still higher performances. To decrease the size of a substrate and increase the density in a substrate, it has been attempted that the sheet of a molded resin forming the main portion of a printed wiring board is made of a multilayer laminate rather than a single layer sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as the information communication network is highly developed, media of the wireless mobile communication have shifted to waves in high frequency regions such as quasi-microwave or waves of higher frequencies and terminal instruments transferring and receiving information are becoming extremely small and light. However, it is the actual present situation that a printed wring board exhibiting excellent overall properties, i.e., excellent properties at high frequencies such as a small permittivity and excellent mechanical properties and impact strength, cannot be found. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> To obtain the composition of the present invention which comprises 40% by weight or more of SPS, the above components may be blended in accordance with various processes such as mixing at the ordinary temperature, mixing with melting and the like. The process for blending is not particularly limited. Among these processes for blending, mixing with melting using a twin screw extruder is preferably used. In the mixing with melting using a twin screw extruder, mixing at 270 to 350&deg; C. is preferable. When the temperature of mixing is lower than 270&deg; C., there is the possibility that productivity decreases due to a high viscosity of the resin and such a temperature is not preferable. When the temperature of mixing exceeds 350&deg; C., there is the possibility that thermal decomposition of the resin takes place and such a temperature is not preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The multilayer printed wiring board of the present invention may have a structure in which B layer comprising one or more layers is laminated to one face of A layer which is formed into a sheet in advance or a structure in which B layer comprising one or more layers is laminated to both faces of A layer which is formed into a sheet in advance, i.e., a structure of (B layer)-(A layer)-(B layer). The structure of (B layer)-(A layer)-(B layer) is superior to the structure of (A layer)-(B layer) since the properties at high frequencies are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The process for preparing the multilayer printed wiring board is not particularly limited. Examples of the process include a process in which A layer comprising an epoxy resin composition or the like is prepared by curing by pressing under heating and an SPS layer (in the form of a sheet) prepared in advance in accordance with the injection process, the extrusion process or the paper making process is pressed to the prepared A layer and heat sealed; a process in which A layer prepared in advance is inserted into a mold and B layer is formed by direct injection molding; a process in which A layer and B layer are laminated together via a thermosetting adhesive or an epoxy adhesive having heat resistance; and the like processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that, in the multilayer printed wiring board of the present invention, the ratio of the total thickness of A layer to the total thickness of B layer in the sectional direction is 200:1 to 1:1 and more preferably 100:1 to 2:1. When the thickness of B layer is so small that the ratio of the total thickness of A layer to the total thickness of B layer in the sectional direction exceeds 200:1, the properties at high frequencies deteriorate. When the thickness of A layer is so small that the ratio of the total thickness of A layer to the total thickness of B layer in the sectional direction is smaller than 1:1, the mechanical properties are inferior and handling becomes difficult. Thus, the ratios outside the above range are not preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> With respect to the thickness of each layer, it is preferable that A layer has a thickness of 0.5 to 2 mm and B layer has a thickness smaller than 0.5 mm, more preferably a thickness smaller than 100 &mgr;m and most preferably a thickness of 10 to 70 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Polyphenylene ether (inherent viscosity: 0.45 dl/g, measured in chloroform at 25&deg; C.) in an amount of 1 kg, 30 g of fumaric acid and 20 g of 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane (NOFMER BC, manufactured by NIPPON YUSHI Co., Ltd.) as the radical generator were dry blended. The obtained mixture was mixed with melting by a 30 mm twin-screw extruder at a rotation speed of a screw of 200 rpm at a set temperature of 300&deg; C. The temperature of the resin was about 331&deg; C. at this time. The obtained strands were cooled and pelletized and polyphenylene ether modified with fumaric acid was obtained. To obtain the fraction of modification, 1 g of the obtained polyphenylene ether modified with fumaric acid was dissolved in ethylbenzene and reprecipitated with methanol. The recovered polymer was extracted with methanol using a Soxhlet extractor and dried. The fraction of modification was obtained from the intensity of the carbonyl absorption in the infrared absorption spectrum of the polymer and from the titration of the polymer. The fraction of modification was found to be 1.45% by weight. </paragraph>
