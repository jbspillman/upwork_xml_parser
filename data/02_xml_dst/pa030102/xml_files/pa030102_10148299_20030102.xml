<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to utilization of radiation energies caused by alpha-decay of a natural radioactive element for improving the efficiency of fuel combustion and purifying the exhaust gas in a power generation system using fossil fuel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the power generation systems using coal or petroleum as fuel, the boilers are of a supercritical pressure type and each of the turbines has a large capacity to improve the efficiency of power generation by an electrostatic precipitator, and a stack-gas desulfurization and denitration facility, etc. are used to purify the exhaust gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the heat recovery combined-cycle power generation system consisting of a combination of a high-efficiency large-scale gas turbine using liquefied natural gas (LNG) and a steam turbine which recovers waste heat from the gas turbine, clean natural gas is used as a fuel and so the overall efficiency of power generation is as high as 50% and the exhaust gas is also clean. However, such a power plant discharges great volumes of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the conventional large-scale power generation system, the exhaust gas purification and improved efficiency of fuel combustion can be attained since many large equipment can be used. Regarding LNG, however, the district where it is usable and consumption thereof are limited. Thus, LNG cannot be used as a fuel in usable and consumption thereof are limited. Thus, LNG cannot be used as a fuel in any middle- or small-scale power generation system and discharges large amounts of NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. With the recent technical advance of the micro gas turbine, power generation systems have been proposed which generate a power with the use of LNG as a fuel while making district cooling and heating by a exhaust gas recovery boiler. However, such a power generation system is not satisfactory in prevention of the environmental pollution by the exhaust gas. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention has an object to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art by providing an environmentally-friendly power generation system which needs not to be of any super-large scale and can generate a power at low costs with an improved purification of the exhaust gas and high efficiency of fossil-fuel combustion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, radiation energies and neutrons caused by alpha-decay of a natural radioactive element which emits 0.6 becquerels/g or more of alpha rays are irradiated to a supply fuel and intake air, necessary for combustion in a combustion equipment in a power generation system using a fossil fuel, to transform oxygen contained in the intake air into active oxygen which is to be used in a fuel activator and air activator, provided in a fuel supply system and air supply system, respectively, to implement a complete combustion of the mixture of the intake air and supply fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, for water supplied to a steam generator, a water activator is provided in a water supply system. An exhaust gas purifier is provided in an exhaust gas discharge system. Further, a neutron irradiator is provided at the outlet of the air activator to return the neutron-irradiated intake air to the air activator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These objects and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated in the form of a schematic block diagram the power generation system according to the present invention. As shown, a boiler combustor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> included a combustion equipment is supplied with a fuel via a fuel pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as well as with combustion air via an air supply fan <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Exhaust gas caused by the combustion in the boiler combustor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is discharged via an exhaust fan <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A steam chest <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> included in the combustion equipment is supplied with water via a boiler feed pump <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Steam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generated by the combustion in the boiler combustor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> drives to rotate a steam turbine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which drives a generator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> coupled to a main shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the steam turbine <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to thereby generate an electric power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is provided in a place A in an air supply system of the combustion equipment, and a fuel activator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is provided in a place B in a fuel supply system. Also, a water activator <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is provided in a place C in a water supply system which supplies water to the steam chest <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and an exhaust gas purifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is provided in a place D in an exhaust gas discharge system. Further, a neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is provided at a split-flow point E in the air supply system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention uses ceramic balls formed by solidifying, with a coagulant, granules or powder of an ore containing 100 ppm/g to 1 g/g (100%) of a natural radioactive element which emits 0.6 becquerels/g or more of radiation energies by alpha-decay and shaping them into the form of balls of about 100 mm in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The fuel activator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A fuel supplied from the inlet of the fuel activator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by means of the fuel pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> flows down in contact with the ceramic balls, indicated with a reference <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, laid dispersedly on multiple mesh-like shelf stages <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is fed to the boiler combustor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the outlet of the fuel activator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. While the fuel is flowing down in repeated contact with many ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the fuel activator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it is activated by radiation energies and neutrons caused by alpha-decay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Note that since the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, exhaust gas purifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and water activator <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are identical in inner construction to each other, description will be made solely of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has provided therein the mesh-like shelves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on which the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laid dispersedly. Each of the shelves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has fixed on the bottom thereof an aeration pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having aeration holes formed therein. In addition, there is provided an aeration unit including a box <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having also ceramic balls <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> placed therein and an aeration air supply fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Aeration air flowing into the aeration unit gets in contact with the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> while being sucked by the aeration air supply fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is irradiated with radiation energies caused by alpha-decay. The aeration air taken into the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the aeration air supply fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is split into the aeration pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> branched from a main aeration pipe <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and blown out of the aeration holes in the aeration pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Air flowing in from the inlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> flows down in contact with the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> laid dispersedly on the mesh-like shelves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is mixed with the aeration air blown out from the aeration pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, the air supplied from the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the boiler combustor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a mixture of the air having flowed into the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and having been irradiated with the radiation energies and neutrons from the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and aeration air supplied from the aeration pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and having been irradiated with the radiation energies and neutrons from the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the aeration unit. It should be noted that when a part of the air from the outlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is split and recirculated as the aeration air, the air is considerably activated. Since the exhaust gas purifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is also provided with such an aeration unit, the recirculation of the exhaust gas will assure a similar effect to that in the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provided at the split-flow point E at the outlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constructed as schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Air flowing into the neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the outlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> flows down in contact with ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; laid dispersedly on the mesh-like shelves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed from forming a mixture of an ore containing 100 ppm/g or more of a natural radioactive element and an ore containing beryllium to balls having a diameter of about 100 mm. The beryllium will emit neutrons when it is irradiated with the radiation energies caused by alpha-decay of the natural radioactive element. Thus, the inflow air in contact with the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; is activated by the neutrons. It should be noted that the outlet of the neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the inlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to recirculate the inflow air for promotion of its activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Next, it will be discussed how the radiation energies caused by alpha-decay of the natural radioactive element react with air. The natural radioactive element will spontaneously change into another element, then into still another element, . . . while emitting radiation energies such as alpha-rays, beta-rays and gamma-rays, and finally into lead which will not change any more. When air is irradiated with such radiation energies caused by alpha-decay, diatomic oxygen in the air is reduced by a negative electron and transformed into a powerful oxidizing active oxygen as in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;e</italic></highlight>&rarr;.O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Air contains oxygen in about 21% and nitrogen in about 78%. When irradiated with the alpha-rays, the nitrogen atom having an atomic number 14 will undergo a fission-transmission into a highly reactive oxygen atom having an atomic number 17 and hydrogen atom having an atomic number 1 as in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>N&plus;<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>He&rarr;<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O&plus;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>H </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At this time, a very small amount of neutron is emitted. When irradiated with the neutrons, the nitrogen atom having an atomic number 14 will undergo a fission-transformation into carbon atom having an atomic number 12 and hydrogen atom having an atomic number 1 as in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>N&plus;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>&rarr;<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>C&plus;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>H </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The monatomic oxygen (<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O) produced due to the atomic nucleus-transformation of the nitrogen will react with the carbon monoxide (CO) to produce carbon dioxide as in the following. In other words, the fuel will be completely burnt. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>CO&plus;O&rarr;CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Also, the active monatomic hydrogen (<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>H) will easily combine with carbon and react with the hydrocarbon (HC), as in the following, to produce methane: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>HC&plus;3H&rarr;CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The active oxygen (.O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) will react with the methane, resulting in complete combustion. That is, the hydrocarbon (HC) produced due to incomplete combustion is changed, due to the monatomic hydrogen, into a hydrocarbon (C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) and will burn again as a fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; laid dispersedly in the neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provided at the outlet of the air activator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed from a mixture of a natural radioactive element and beryllium and emit neutrons as in the following: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further, the nitrogen atom having an atomic number 14 in the air having been irradiated with the neutrons emitted from the ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; will undergo a fission-transformation into carbon atom having an atomic number 12 and hydrogen atom having an atomic number 1 as in the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>N&plus;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>&rarr;<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>C&plus;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>H </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the passage downstream of the air inlet, the hydrocarbon will be burnt according to the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&plus;(<highlight><italic>n&plus;m/</italic></highlight>4)O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;3.76(<highlight><italic>n&plus;m/</italic></highlight>4)N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&rarr;n</italic></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;(<highlight><italic>m/</italic></highlight>2)H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&plus;3.76(<highlight><italic>n&plus;m/</italic></highlight>4)N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In air, each element is in an excited condition in which it shows a powerful oxidizing reaction. Also, since active oxygen, which is capable of a power oxidizing reaction, is used, incomplete combustion can be prevented to improve the combustion efficiency of a combustion equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each of the aforementioned activators has provided therein many ceramic balls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing 100 ppm/g to 1 g/g (100%) of a natural radioactive element which emits 0.6 becquerels/g or more of radiation energies by alpha-decay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Therefore, to protect the human body against irradiation of the radiation energies and neutrons caused by alpha-decay, the apparatus has to be fully housed in a box made of a lead plate having a thickness of about 100 mm. Also the neutron irradiator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to emit neutrons should be provided with the above protective feature. It should be noted that there may be provided a plurality of the above-mentioned activator stages and a recirculation circuit to further improve the effect of activation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As having been described in the foregoing, owing to the irradiation with the radiation energies caused by alpha-decay of a natural radioactive element, diatomic oxygen in the supply air can be changed into a powerful oxidizing active oxygen, and nitrogen in the air undergoes fission-transformation into monatomic oxygen and monatomic hydrogen, resulting in an increased oxygen content in the air. Also, owing to irradiation with neutrons, a part of the nitrogen in the air undergoes fission-transformation into monatomic carbon and monatomic hydrogen. The irradiation of alpha-rays, beta-rays and gamma-rays to the hydrocarbon in a fuel promotes the decomposition and bridging reactions. Since the above active oxygen permits complete combustion of the fuel, it is possible to reduce toxic components of exhaust gas and purify the exhaust gas at low costs. That is, the power generation system according to the present invention needs no large space for installation, and is environmentally friendly since the complete combustion of a fossil fuel contributes to an improved efficiency of combustion. </paragraph>
