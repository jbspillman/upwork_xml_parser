<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a particulate water-absorbing composition, an absorbent article, and an absorbent structure, wherein the absorbent article and the absorbent structure comprise the particulate water-absorbing composition. More specifically, the invention relates to a particulate water-absorbing composition, an absorbent article, and an absorbent structure wherein the particulate water-absorbing composition can provide especially excellent deodorizability and excellent absorption properties, and further, gel stability, to absorbent structures for sanitary materials such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and incontinent pads in the case where used in the absorbent structures. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, water-absorbent resins are widely used as among components of sanitary materials, such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and incontinent pads, for the purpose of causing the water absorbent resins to absorb body liquids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As to the above water-absorbent resins, the following are known as their examples: partially-neutralized and crosslinked poly(acrylic acids); hydrolyzed graft polymers of starch-acrylonitrile; neutralized graft polymers of starch-acrylic acid; saponified copolymers of vinyl acetate-acrylate esters; crosslinked polymers of carboxymethyl cellulose; hydrolyzed copolymers of acrylonitrile or acrylamide, or crosslinked polymers of these hydrolyzed copolymers; crosslinked polymers of cationic monomers; crosslinked copolymers of isobutylene-maleic acid; and crosslinked copolymers of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid-acrylic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is said that the above water-absorbent resins are desired to have water absorption properties such as, upon contact with aqueous liquids (e.g. body fluids), high absorption capacity, excellent absorption rate, liquid permeability, gel strength of swollen gel, and suction quantity to suck up water from a base material containing aqueous liquids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above, various attempts are made to provide added functions to the water-absorbent resins by adding thereto deodorizable and antibacterial compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The deodorization is one of performances desirable to absorbent articles, and studies are made to enhance the deodorizability of the water-absorbent resins. Proposed as methods for providing the deodorizability are, for example, methods in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the follow materials: active carbon (JP-A-105448/1984); extracts from leaves of Theaceae plants (JP-A-158861/1985); essences extracted from coniferous trees (JP-A-241030/1999); manufactured tea (JP-A-041155/1990); tannic acid and complex silicate salt compounds (JP-A-116829/1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, as to the method in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the active carbon (JP-A-105448/1984), there are problems in that the deodorizing effect is displayed by adsorption of malodorous components to the active carbon, but that the adsorbency of the active carbon deteriorates with the passage of time so much that the active carbon becomes deactivated in a period of from the provision to absorbent articles till absorption of urine by the absorbent articles during their practical use. In addition, there are also significant problems in that the active carbon causes black coloring of diapers in the case where used for the diapers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As to the method in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the extracts from leaves of Theaceae plants (JP-A-158861/1985), the problems of coloring are improved, but the effect during the practical use is low. In addition, production costs increase because of the extraction from leaves of plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As to the method in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the essences extracted from coniferous trees (JP-A-241030/1999), essential oils such as essences extracted from trees have strong smells peculiar to them and therefore, during the practical use, for example, display a high deodorizing effect of rendering the odor of urine indistinguishable. In such a case, the deodorizing effect is mainly from an odor-masking effect. The deodorization by masking involves the smells peculiar to the essential oils. And there are differences between individuals&apos; tastes for smells, so the essential oils are not suitable as consumer materials aimed at many people. In addition, the essential oils involve production costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As to the method in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the tannic acid and the complex silicate salt compounds (JP-A-116829/1999), the removal effect is displayed upon specific malodorous substances, but the deodorizing effect during the practical use of absorbent articles cannot be said to be enough, probably because there is no effect upon bad smells included in actual body fluids such as urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As to the method in which the water-absorbent resins are allowed to contain the manufactured tea (JP-A-041155/1990), the deodorizing effect of the manufactured tea itself is good, but still the deodorizing effect during the practical use of absorbent articles could not be said to be enough, probably because of performances of water-absorbent resins being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In addition, by reason of the use for such as absorbent articles, the provision with the deodorizability is always desired to involve high safety. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as to the present invention, what is herein referred to simply as &ldquo;water-absorbent resin&rdquo; means a polymer of which only the inside is crosslinked, while what is herein referred to as &ldquo;surface-crosslinked water-absorbent resin&rdquo; means a polymer of which the inside and the surface are crosslinked. However, in some prior art documents, the latter might be referred to simply as &ldquo;water-absorbent resin&rdquo;, and the former might be referred to as &ldquo;water-absorbent resin precursor&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Used as the water-absorbent resin in the present invention is favorably a water-absorbent resin of which a surface portion and/or its vicinity is surface-treated with a crosslinking agent, specifically, treated by crosslinking with a crosslinking agent reactable with a functional group of the water-absorbent resin, and/or which exhibits an absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g, a suction power of not less than 9 g/g under a load, and an absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As to the absorption properties of the water-absorbent resin, it is favorable, for enhancing the effect of providing the deodorizability to the whole diaper, to combine together a plant powder and a water-absorbent resin which satisfies all the properties such as the absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g, the suction power of not less than 9 g/g under a load, and the absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds. Although not clear, the cause is considered to be probably that if the water-absorbent resin is limited to such as exhibits the specific absorption capacity, suction power under a load, and absorption rate and if such a water-absorbent resin is combined with the plant powder, then the optimum balance between the action of the plant powder and the liquid absorption upon contact with urine is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The water-absorbent resin of which a surface portion and/or its vicinity is surface-crosslinked with a crosslinking agent, used in the present invention, is generally obtained by a production process comprising the step of subjecting a water-absorbent resin to a surface-crosslinking treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The water-absorbent resin in the present invention means a water-swellable and water-insoluble crosslinked polymer which absorbs water to form an anionic, nonionic, cationic, or their hybrid water-insoluble hydrogel. In addition, the particulate water-absorbing composition, as referred to in the present invention, means a material which contains the water-absorbent resin in a major proportion, favorably, of not less than 70 weight %, more favorably, of not less than 80 weight %, and absorbs water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the term &ldquo;water-swellable&rdquo; means that the material is able to absorb at least 2 times, favorably 10 to 3,000 times, more favorably 50 to 2,000 times, as large a quantity of water as its own weight (solid content) in ion-exchanged water, and the term &ldquo;water-insoluble&rdquo; means that the uncrosslinked water-extractable content in the water-absorbent resin is not more than 50 weight %, favorably not more than 25 weight %, more favorably not more than 20 weight %, still more favorably not more than 15 weight %, particularly favorably not more than 10 weight %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A method for measuring the water-extractable content is specified in EDANA RECOMMENDED TEST METHODS 470, 1-99 EXTRACTABLES of EUROPEAN DISPOSABLES AND NONWOVENS ASSOCIATION. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Examples of such water-absorbent resins include one or mixtures of the following materials: partially-neutralized and crosslinked poly(acrylic acids); hydrolyzed graft polymers of starch-acrylonitrile; neutralized graft polymers of starch-acrylic acid; saponified copolymers of vinyl acetate-acrylate esters; hydrolyzed copolymers of acrylonitrile or acrylamide, or crosslinked polymers of these hydrolyzed copolymers; modified polymers of carboxyl-group-containing crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohols); and crosslinked copolymers of isobutylene-maleic anhydride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> These water-absorbent resins may be used either alone respectively or in combinations with each other, but, in particular, one or mixtures of those which have a carboxyl group are favorable, and it is typically favorable that the water-absorbent resin comprises a polymer (water-swellable crosslinked polymer of poly(acrylic acid (salt))) as the main component which polymer is obtained by a process including the steps of polymerizing monomers including acrylic acid and/or its salt (neutralized product) as the main component and then crosslinking the resultant polymer. In addition, these water-absorbent resins may be either water-containing hydrogels, or powders obtained by a process including the steps of: drying the hydrogels, if necessary; and usually pulverizing them before and/or after the drying step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned water-absorbent resin, for example, can be obtained by a process including the steps of: polymerizing or copolymerizing at lease one monomer selected from the group consisting of unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as (meth)acrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, and &bgr;-acryloyloxypropionic acid, and neutralized products thereof; and then, if need be, subjecting the resultant polymer to operations, such as pulverization and classification, to arrange its particle diameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The neutralization ratio of the above acid group is favorably adjusted into the range of 30 to 100 mol %, more favorably 60 to 90 mol %, still more favorably 65 to 75 mol %. The neutralization of the acid group may be carried out either by neutralization of an acid-group-containing monomer in an aqueous solution before polymerization, or by neutralization of an aqueous solution of the polymer, in other words, by post-neutralization of a polymer gel, or both neutralizations may be used jointly with each other. Favorable examples of salts being neutralized include those of sodium, lithium, potassium, ammonia, and amines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As to the monomer, (meth)acrylic acid and their neutralized products are preferable of the above monomers. The weight-average particle diameter is favorably in the range of 100 to 600 &mgr;m, more favorably 200 to 500 &mgr;m, and the proportion of particles having particle diameters of smaller than 106 &mgr;m is not more than 10 weight %, favorably not more than 5 weight %, more favorably not more than 3 weight %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the above-mentioned water-absorbent resin may be a copolymer of the above-mentioned monomer and another monomer copolymerizable therewith. Specific examples of the above other monomer include: anionic unsaturated monomers, such as vinylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acryloylethanesulfonic acid, and 2-(meth)acryloylpropanesulfonic acid, and salts thereof; nonionic hydrophilic-group-containing unsaturated monomers such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-ethyl(meth)acrylamide, N-n-propyl(meth)acrylamide, N-isopropyl(meth)acrylamide, N,N-dimethyl(meth)acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol (meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, vinylpyridine, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-acryloylpiperidine, and N-acryloylpyrrolidine; and cationic unsaturated monomers such as N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-diethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminopropyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamide, and quaternary salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is favorable that the water-absorbent resin is such as internally crosslinked by a reaction or copolymerization with a crosslinking agent having at least two polymerizable unsaturated groups or at least two reactive groups. In addition, the water-absorbent resin may be a self-crosslinking type which does not need any crosslinking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of the above crosslinking agent (which might be referred to as internal-crosslinking agent) include N,N&prime;-methylenebis(meth)acrylamide, (poly)ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, (poly)propylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, glycerol tri(meth)acrylate, glycerol acrylate methacrylate, ethylene-oxide-modified trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl phosphate, triallylamine, poly(meth)allyloxyalkanes, (poly)ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol diglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, ethylenediamine, polyethylenimine, and glycidyl (meth)acrylate. These crosslinking agents may be used either alone respectively or in combinations with each other. Among the above exemplifying compounds, those which have at least two polymerizable unsaturated groups are preferably used as the crosslinking agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The amount of the crosslinking agent as used is favorably in the range of 0.01 to 2 mol %, more favorably 0.03 to 0.2 mol %, of the total of the above-mentioned monomers. In the case where the amount of the crosslinking agent as used is smaller than 0.01 mol %, caution is needed, because it might be difficult to obtain the properties such as the suction power of not less than 9 g/g under a load by the below-mentioned surface-crosslinking treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, usable when the above polymerization is initiated are, for example, as follows: radical polymerization initiators such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and 2,2&prime;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; or active energy rays such as ultraviolet rays and electron beams. In addition, when oxidizable radical polymerization initiators are used, redox polymerization can, for example, be carried out using jointly therewith reducing agents such as sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogensulfite, ferrous sulfate, and L-ascorbic acid. The amount of these polymerization initiators as used is favorably in the range of 0.001 to 2 mol %, more favorably 0.01 to 0.5 mol %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition, also favorable is a way in which such as foaming agents (e.g. carbonate salts, azo compounds) or inert gases are added into the monomer during the polymerization in order for the resultant water-absorbent resin to have a porous structure, therefore, an increased specific surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, as to the process for producing the water-absorbent resin in the present invention, for example, in cases of aqueous solution polymerization, the process includes the following sequential steps of: arrangement of aqueous monomer solution&mdash;polymerization&mdash;fine particulation of polymer&mdash;drying&mdash;pulverization&mdash;classification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the case where the above aqueous solution polymerization is carried out, an aqueous monomer solution having a concentration of generally 10 weight % to saturation, favorably 20 to 60 weight %, is arranged and then polymerized. As to the polymerization method, examples thereof include: a method in which the polymerization is carried out in a twin-arm kneader while agitation is carried out if necessary; a method in which cast polymerization is carried out in a container; and a method in which static polymerization is (continuously) carried out on a moving belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For drying the polymer (hydrogel) resultant from the above polymerization step, it is desirable to finely particulate this hydrogel into predetermined particle diameters. The fine particulation of the hydrogel can be carried out during the polymerization by doing the polymerization under stirred conditions with such as twin-arm kneaders, or can be carried out by extruding the gel from dies with such as meat choppers after the polymerization. In addition, the fine particulation can also be carried out with such as cutting mills. The particle diameters of the finely particulated gel can fitly be set according to such as ability of driers, but is generally preferably in the range of 0.1 to 10 mm. In the case where the gel is finer than 0.1 mm, the properties of the resultant water-absorbent resin might be inferior. In the case where the gel is coarser than 10 mm, the gel might be difficult to dry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the fine particulation step, a coarse gel with particle diameters larger than 10 mm and a fine gel with particle diameters smaller than 0.1 mm might form. These polymers can be separated and then added to such as an aqueous monomer solution or a polymer gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The gel as finely particulated in the above fine particulation step is dried in the drying step. Examples of usable means for drying include hot-air driers, air blow type (pneumatic type) driers, azeotropic dehydration, fluidized-bed driers, drum driers, microwaves, and far infrared rays. The drying temperature is favorably not lower than 80&deg; C., more favorably not lower than 120&deg; C., still more favorably in the range of 150 to 250&deg; C., yet still more favorably in the range of 160 to 220&deg; C. </paragraph>

Furthermore, the water-absorbent resin may comprise either substantially ungranulated primary particles or a granulated matter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned water-absorbent resin generally does not satisfy the requirements of the present invention for the ranges of the absorption capacity, the suction power under a load, and the water absorption rate. Therefore, the crosslinking density in the vicinity of surfaces of the water-absorbent resin needs to be rendered higher than that inside the water-absorbent resin by further using a crosslinking agent. In other words, water absorbent resins usable in the present invention are obtained by crosslinking the vicinity of surfaces of the water-absorbent resin with the crosslinking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, obtainable from these water-absorbent resins are a water-absorbent resin of which a surface portion and/or its vicinity is treated by crosslinking, and/or a water-absorbent resin which exhibits an absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g, a suction power of not less than 9 g/g under a load, and a water absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the case where the functional group of the water-absorbent resin is for example a carboxyl group, examples of the surface-crosslinking agent include one or more members selected from the group consisting of: polyhydric alcohol compounds such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, polypropylene glycol, glycerol, polyglycerol, 2-butene-1,4-diol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2-cyclohexanol, trimethylolpropane, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, polyoxypropylene, oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers, pentaerythritol and sorbitol; epoxy compounds such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol polyglycidyl ether, diglycerol polyglycidyl ether, polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ether and glycidol; polyamine compounds such as ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, polyallylamine, and polyethylenimine; polyisocyanate compounds such as 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate; polyoxazoline compounds such as 1,2-ethylenebisoxazoline; alkylene carbonate compounds such as 1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4-ethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 1,3-dioxan-2-one, 4-methyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one, 4,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one and 1,3-dioxopan-2-one; mono-, di-, or polyoxazolidine compounds; haloepoxy compounds such as epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and &agr;-methylepichlorohydrin; polyvalent metallic compounds such as hydroxides and chlorides of such as zinc, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, iron and zirconium; silane coupling agents such as &ggr;-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and &ggr;-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; and polyamide-polyamine-epihalohydrin resins. Preferable are those which include at least one member selected from the group consisting of the polyhydric alcohol compounds, the polyamine compounds, the polyepoxy compounds, and the alkylene carbonate compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The amount of the surface-crosslinking agent as used depends on factors such as the compounds as used as the surface-crosslinking agents or combinations of such compounds, but is favorably in the range of 0.001 to 5 weight parts, more favorably 0.01 to 1 weight part, per 100 weight parts of the solid content of the water-absorbent resin. If the above-mentioned surface-crosslinking agents are used, the crosslinking density in the vicinity of surfaces of the water-absorbent resin can be rendered higher than that inside, thereby forming what has the absorption properties which are required of the present invention resin. The amount larger than 10 weight parts of the surface-crosslinking agent as used is not only uneconomical, but also might be so excessive to the formation of the optimal crosslinked structure in the water absorbent resin as to unfavorably result in a low absorption capacity. In addition, in the case where the amount of the surface-crosslinking agent as used is smaller than 0.001 weight part, the suction power of the water-absorbent resin under a load might be difficult to enhance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the water-absorbent resin and the surface-crosslinking agent are mixed together, water is preferably used as a solvent. The amount of water as used depends upon such as type or particle diameters of the water-absorbent resin, but is favorably in the range of 0 to 20 weight parts (but not including 0 weight part), more favorably in the range of 0.1 to 10 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the solid content of the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>

However, the mixing method is not especially limited. Preferable among various mixing methods is a method comprising the step of spraying or dropwise adding the surface-crosslinking agent (as dissolved in water and/or the hydrophilic organic solvent, if necessary) directly onto the water-absorbent resin, thus mixing them. In addition, in the case where the mixing step is carried out using water, there may coexist such as water-insoluble finely-particulate powders or surfactants. </paragraph>

The treatment temperature in this thermal treatment depends upon the surface-crosslinking agent as used, but is favorably in the range of 40 to 250&deg; C., more favorably 90 to 210&deg; C. In the case where the treatment temperature is lower than 40&deg; C., no uniform crosslinked structure is formed and it might therefore be impossible to obtain the water-absorbent resin of which the suction power under a load is in the range as defined by the present invention. In the case where the treatment temperature is higher than 250&deg; C., caution is needed, because the water-absorbent resin might be degraded so much as to merely exhibit low performance. </paragraph>

So many spices are used for foods, and the spice is produced naturally or by culture. The usable spice means a product obtained using a spice as a starting material, which product is, for example, a spice produced by intactly arranging the shape or particles of its starting material, or a spice powder formed by pulverizing its starting material. The usable spice is not such as is obtained by separating only a single component from a spice, but such as contains various components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The spice favorably usable in the present invention is a spice having deodorizability, and is not especially limited, but can be exemplified by Tracheophyta plants such as ajowan, anises, fennels, turmeric, allspices, oreganos, mustard, cardamoms, caraways, cumin, cloves, peppers, corianders, saffron, Japanese peppers, perillas, cinnamons, ginger, cardamoms, ziiru (in Japanese), star anises, sage, onions, thyme, turmeric, cloves, dill, capsicums, nutmegs, nikuzuku (in Japanese) (nutmegs), garlic, peppermint, parsley, basil, paprika, vanillas, feneguriiku (in Japanese), fennels, mace, rosemary, laurier, laurels, and Japanese horseradishes.

Above all, peppers, Japanese peppers, ginger, capsicums, parsley, and Japanese horseradishes are used especially favorably for the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The shape of the above spices is different according to the aimed deodorizability, but is powdery, and the size of their particles is such that they can pass through a mesh of which the mesh opening size is 850 &mgr;m, favorably 600 &mgr;m, more favorably 500 &mgr;m, still more favorably 300 &mgr;m, and further that the volume-average particle diameter is favorably not larger than 850 &mgr;m, more favorably not larger than 600 &mgr;m, still more favorably not larger than 500 &mgr;m, yet still more favorably not larger than 300 &mgr;m. Common liquid spices are unfavorable, because they might be so aromatic as to give an unpleasant feeling. In addition, in the case where the particle diameter is larger than 850 &mgr;m, the actions of effective components contained in the spice might unfavorably be insufficient to provide stable deodorizability during contact with urine. In addition, it is preferable that the volume-average particle diameter of the spice is smaller than the weight-average particle diameter of the water-absorbent resin, because more excellent deodorizability can be provided in such a case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The water content of the spice usable in the present invention is not especially limited, but is favorably not more than 40%, more favorably not more than 30%, still more favorably not more than 20%, yet still more favorably not more than 10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The tea leaf usable in the present invention is such as obtained by processing a plant which is a Tracheophyta plant so that it may be fit to drink.

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The general value of the water content in the above tea leaf is, for example, in the range of 6 to 9 g per 100 g of the tea leaf, but the water content of the tea leaf as used in the present invention is not especially limited, but tea leaves having various water contents are usable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The residue of extraction from the tea leaf, usable in the present invention, can be exemplified by residues of extraction from the above tea leaves, and, favorably, a dried product of the residue of extraction from the tea leaf is used.

Having water contents in these ranges is favorable also for facilitation of handling of the extraction residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Fine powders which are formed as by-products in processes for production of tea, or tea leaves and/or residues of extraction therefrom which are discharged as the extraction residues being left behind in extraction of tea, are presently disposed of, and are therefore utilizable favorably in aspects of such as effective utilization of resources or prices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The shape of the above tea leaf and/or residue of extraction therefrom is different according to the aimed deodorizability, but is powdery, and the size of their particles is such that they can pass through a mesh of which the mesh opening size is 850 &mgr;m, favorably 600 &mgr;m, more favorably 500 &mgr;m, still more favorably 300 &mgr;m. The volume-average particle diameter is favorably not larger than 500 &mgr;m, more favorably not larger than 300 &mgr;m. In the case where the volume-average particle diameter is larger than 500 &mgr;m, the actions of effective components contained in the tea leaf and/or residue of extraction therefrom might unfavorably be insufficient to provide stable deodorizability during contact with urine. In addition, it is preferable that the volume-average particle diameter of the tea leaf and/or residue of extraction therefrom is smaller than the weight-average particle diameter of the water-absorbent resin, because more excellent deodorizability can be provided in such a case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As to absorbent articles (such as diapers) in which conventional water-absorbent resins containing the above plant powder are used, some of those water-absorbent resins might provide the deodorizability to the whole diaper so insufficiently as to give wearers an unpleasant feeling. However, the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention solves the above problems by specifying the properties of a water-absorbent resin which has not yet been mixed with the plant powder, and this particulate water-absorbing composition can provide excellent deodorizability and excellent absorption properties to absorbent articles and is favorably used for the absorbent articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition, as to conventional water-absorbent resins, the balance between their water absorption properties is being improved by subjecting a surface portion and/or its vicinity of the water-absorbent resin to a crosslinking treatment with a crosslinking agent reactable with a functional group of the water-absorbent resin, but, in the case where the water-absorbent resin is used in absorbent articles (such as diapers), the water-absorbent resin might deteriorate with the passage of time so much as to provide inferior results with regard to the liquid permeability, gel strength, or absorption properties. However, because of containing the plant powder, the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention is surprisingly a particulate water-absorbing composition which deteriorates little with the passage of time after absorption of urine and exhibits excellent gel stability, and can provide excellent deodorizability and excellent absorption properties to absorbent articles for a long time and is favorably used for the absorbent articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The amount of the above plant powder as used is different according to the aimed deodorizability, but the amount thereof as added is favorably in the range of 0.001 to 20 weight parts, more favorably 0.01 to 10 weight parts, still more favorably 0.01 to 5 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the solid content of the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition, examples of methods for adding the above plant powder include: a method comprising the step of mixing the water-absorbent resin directly with the plant powder so that a desired amount of the plant powder may be added to the water-absorbent resin of which a surface portion and/or its vicinity is treated by crosslinking with the crosslinking agent reactable with a functional group of the water-absorbent resin (for example, a dry blend method in which powders are mixed together); a method comprising the steps of mixing the water-absorbent resin directly with the plant powder, and then spraying or dropwise adding such as water, aqueous liquids, or various organic solvents onto the resultant mixture, thus mixing them; and a method comprising the steps of dispersing the plant powder into such as water, aqueous liquids, or various organic solvents, and then spraying or dropwise adding the resultant dispersion directly onto the water-absorbent resin, thus mixing them. Incidentally, there can also be adopted the following methods: a method comprising the step of adding the plant powder during the polymerization of the water-absorbent resin; and a method comprising the step of adding the plant powder to the resultant gel after the polymerization. However, in cases where these methods are adopted, they need to be carried out in a way such that the resultant composition will satisfy the claimed ranges of the absorption capacity, the suction power under a load, and the absorption rate as a result of the steps as thereafter carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferable of the above methods for adding the plant powder are as follows: the method comprising the steps of mixing the water-absorbent resin directly with the plant powder, and then spraying or dropwise adding such as water, aqueous liquids, or various organic solvents onto the resultant mixture, thus mixing them; the method comprising the steps of dispersing the plant powder into such as water, aqueous liquids, or various organic solvents, and then spraying or dropwise adding the resultant dispersion directly onto the water-absorbent resin, thus mixing them; the method comprising the step of adding the plant powder during the polymerization of the water-absorbent resin; and the method comprising the step of adding the plant powder to the resultant gel after the polymerization. These methods give a form in which the plant powder is held by the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As to the present invention, in the case where the water-absorbent resin and the plant powder are mixed together, the optimum amount of such as water, water vapor, or aqueous liquids including water and hydrophilic organic solvents, which are added if necessary, is different according to the type or particle diameters of the water-absorbent resin. However, in the case of water, the amount thereof is usually not larger than 10 weight parts, favorably in the range of 1 to 5 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the solid content of the water-absorbent resin. In addition, similarly, the amount of the hydrophilic organic solvent as used is usually not larger than 10 weight parts, favorably in the range of 0.1 to 5 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the solid content of the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The apparatus which is used to mix the water absorbent resin and the plant powder together in the present invention may be a conventional one, and examples thereof include cylinder type mixers, screw type mixers, screw type extruders, turbilizers, Nauta type mixers, V-character-shaped mixers, ribbon type mixers, twin-arm kneaders, fluidizing type mixers, air blow type (pneumatic type) mixers, rotary disk type mixers, roll mixers, and tumbling type mixers. The mixing speed may be either high or low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Various inorganic powders may be added further to the above water absorbent resin and/or particulate water-absorbing composition. Specific examples of the inorganic powder include: metal oxides such as silicon dioxide and titanium oxide; silicic acid (or its salts) such as natural zeolite and synthetic zeolite; kaolin; talc; clay; and bentonite. Among these, favorable ones are silicon dioxide and silicic acid (or its salts), and more favorable ones are silicon dioxide and silicic acid (or its salts) with an average particle diameter of not larger than 200 &mgr;m as measured by the Coulter Counter Method. The amount of the inorganic powder depends on combinations of the water-absorbent resin and/or particulate water-absorbing composition with the inorganic powder, but is in the range of 0.001 to 10 weight parts, favorably 0.01 to 5 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of the water absorbent resin and/or particulate water-absorbing composition. The method for mixing the water-absorbent resin and/or particulate water-absorbing composition with the inorganic powder is not especially limited, and, for example, dry blend methods in which powders are mixed together or wet mixing methods are available, but the dry blend methods are preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, a difference between the plant powder and a powder on which an essence extracted from a plant (essential oil) is carried is as follows: components having the deodorizing effect are retained in fibrous portions of the plant powder, and liquids such as urine prevent the deodorizing components from volatilizing and/or flowing out, and the deodorizing components effectively work as the need arises, and further, fibrous portions of plants seem to also have an effect on such as adsorption of malodorous components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In addition, another difference between the plant powder and the powder on which the essence extracted from a plant (essential oil) is carried is as follows: the latter has a great powder odor strength and therefore displays a high deodorizing effect during the practical use, but this deodorizing effect is mainly from an odor-masking effect. The deodorization by masking is not suitable, because it involves smells peculiar to the masking material, and because there are differences between individuals&apos; tastes for smells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The powder odor strength is favorably not more than 4, more favorably not more than 3, still more favorably not more than 2, most favorably not more than 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The particulate water-absorbing composition as obtained by the above production process is a particulate water-absorbing composition which comprises a plant powder and a water-absorbent resin, wherein a surface portion and/or its vicinity of the water-absorbent resin is surface-treated with a crosslinking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A particulate water-absorbing composition, according to the present invention, is characterized by comprising a plant powder and a water-absorbent resin, wherein a surface portion and/or its vicinity of the water-absorbent resin is surface-treated with a crosslinking agent, and wherein the particulate water-absorbing composition exhibits an offensive-odor removal index of not less than 180 wherein the offensive-odor removal index is represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>offensive-odor removal index&equals;1.1&times;hydrogen sulfide removal ratio&plus;2.0&times;methylmercaptan removal ratio&plus;0.3&times;ammonia removal ratio. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As is mentioned below, the offensive-odor removal index is an index as calculated from the three removal ratios&apos; hydrogen sulfide removal ratio, methylmercaptan removal ratio, and ammonia removal ratio; and it is needed for the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention that this offensive-odor removal index is not less than 180. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> JP-A-079159/2000 and JP-A-116829/1999 disclose the malodorous-substance removability of water-absorbent resins and their deodorizing effect during their practical use. As to JP-A-079159/2000, ammonia is used as the malodorous substance, but, actually, malodorous components of liquids (e.g. urine, menstrual blood) as excreted out of bodies are so various that it does not follow that the ammonia removability copes with all odors. In addition, as to JP-A-116829/1999, the deodorizing effect of water-absorbent resins is examined in a liquid-unabsorbed (unswollen) state by using ammonia, methylamine, and t-butylmercaptan as the malodorous substances to measure their concentrations remaining after a predetermined time has passed, and further the deodorizing effect of water-absorbent resins is further examined by using human urine as an evaluation close to a practical state of the use of absorbent articles to measure the concentrations of gases of ammonia, methylamine, hydrogen sulfide, and methylmercaptan after a predetermined time has passed. However, the removal effect on these malodorous components is different from the human sense of smell and, therefore, even if the offensive odors are much removed, there cannot be said to be the effect in cases of the practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In addition, as to the measurement of the removal of already known malodorous substances, the results thereof are much different according to measurement conditions such as concentrations of the malodorous substances, time passing until the measurement, temperature in a period of until the measurement, and amounts of water-absorbent resins as used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present inventors diligently studied about water-absorbent resins having the deodorizing effect during the practical use. As a result, it is not until by the present inventors that the particulate water-absorbing composition comprising the surface-treated water-absorbent resin and the plant powder and displaying the offensive-odor removability (herein referred to as offensive-odor removal index) under specific conditions has been found out to display the effect also during the practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The offensive-odor removal index is an total expression of the ratios of removals of ammonia, methylmercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide as the malodorous components by the above particulate water-absorbing composition under specific conditions and is represented by the following relational formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>offensive-odor removal index&equals;1.1&times;hydrogen sulfide removal ratio&plus;2.0&times;methylmercaptan removal ratio&plus;0.3&times;ammonia removal ratio. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is not until by setting the degree of importance upon the ratios of removals of the malodorous components by the particulate water-absorbing composition comprising the water-absorbent resin and the plant powder that it has become possible to quantify the human sense of smell to offensive odors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> However, the above relational formula according to the present invention is related only to the particulate water-absorbing composition comprising the water-absorbent resin and the plant powder, and it is not until by the present inventors that the particulate water-absorbing composition has been found out to display the effect during the practical use in the case where the offensive-odor removal index of this composition is not less than 180. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in general, particulate water-absorbing compositions which satisfy the offensive-odor removal index of not less than 180 do not necessarily display the effect upon liquids (e.g. urine, menstrual blood) as excreted out of bodies. The reason for this can be considered to be that the offensive-odor removability (removability upon various malodorous components contained in liquids as excreted out of bodies), during the practical use, of the particulate water-absorbing composition comprising the water-absorbent resin and the plant powder can be simulated by the aforementioned relational formula dealing with ammonia, methylmercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The offensive-odor removal index is favorably not less than 200, more favorably not less than 220, still more favorably not less than 240, yet still more favorably not less than 260, particularly favorably not less than 280. In the case where the offensive-odor removal index is less than 180, there are disadvantages in that the effects of the present invention cannot sufficiently be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If the water-absorbent resin and/or the plant powder is selected to enhance the offensive-odor removal index of the particulate water-absorbing composition, then it is possible to obtain a particulate water-absorbing composition which displays a still higher deodorizing effect during the practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The particulate water-absorbing composition, according to the present invention, preferably exhibits an absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g, a suction index of not less than 14 g/g under a load, and an absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The above absorption capacity is more favorably not less than 27 g/g, still more favorably not less than 29 g/g, particularly favorably not less than 31 g/g. In the case where the absorption capacity is less than 25 g/g, there are disadvantages in that the absorption quantity is insufficient. In the case where the absorption capacity is more than 60 g/g, there are disadvantages in that the gel strength is so weak that the gel blocking easily occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The above suction index under a load is a new parameter for measuring the power for the water-absorbent resin to suck liquids from paper, and is represented by the sum of a value displayed for a liquid absorption time of 3 minutes and a value displayed for a liquid absorption time of 60 minutes. If this total value is high, the power to suck liquids surrounding the particulate water-absorbing composition is so great as to serve to enhance the deodorizing effect of the plant powder by taking in liquids (e.g. urine, menstrual blood) which are excreted out of bodies to emit offensive odors. In addition, such a function provides the excellent deodorizing effect not only to the particulate water-absorbing composition, but also to absorbent articles. The suction index under a load is more favorably not less than 16 g/g, still more favorably not less than 18 g/g, particularly favorably not less than 20 g/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The above absorption rate is more favorably not more than 55 seconds, still more favorably not more than 50 seconds. In the case where the absorption rate is more than 60 seconds, there are disadvantages in that the liquid absorption is slow and that the deodorizing effect is also deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The above absorption properties, represented by the absorption capacity, the suction index under a load, and the absorption rate, can not only enhance the deodorizing function, but also provide actual absorbent articles with the reduction of leakage, the reduction of the desorption (wet back) quantity, the prevention of a buttock rash, and the enhancement of a dryness feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> With regard to the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention, the weight-average particle diameter is favorably in the range of 100 to 600 &mgr;m, more favorably 200 to 500 &mgr;m, and the proportion of particles having particle diameters of smaller than 106 &mgr;m is favorably not more than 10 weight %, more favorably not more than 5 weight %, still more favorably not more than 3 weight %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The particulate water-absorbing composition, according to the present invention, is favorably used for sanitary materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The absorbent article, according to the present invention, comprises an absorbent layer, a liquid-permeable surface sheet, and a liquid-impermeable back sheet, wherein the absorbent layer includes the present invention particulate water-absorbing composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As to the absorbent article according to the present invention, favorably the weight ratio of the particulate water-absorbing composition as included in the absorbent layer is not less than 0.3. Favorably the weight ratio of the particulate water-absorbing composition to the total of hydrophilic fibers and the particulate water-absorbing composition is not less than 0.3. Such a weight ratio is more favorably in the range of 0.4 to 1.0, still more favorably 0.5 to 0.8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As to the absorbent article according to the present invention, in the case where the weight ratio of the particulate water-absorbing composition as included in the absorbent layer is less than 0.3, there are disadvantages in that the amount of the particulate water-absorbing composition as used might be too small to sufficiently provide the deodorizability to the whole diaper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The water-absorbent resin which is a component of the particulate water-absorbing composition as included in the absorbent layer of the absorbent article according to the present invention comprises a crosslinked poly(acrylic acid (salt)) as the main component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The particulate water-absorbing composition as included in the absorbent layer of the absorbent article according to the present invention is a particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention, and is therefore characterized by exhibiting an offensive-odor removal index of not less than 180 which is represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>offensive-odor removal index&equals;1.1&times;hydrogen sulfide removal ratio&plus;2.0&times;methylmercaptan removal ratio&plus;0.3&times;ammonia removal ratio. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the particulate water-absorbing composition, as included in the absorbent layer of the absorbent article according to the present invention, favorably exhibits an absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g, a suction index of not less than 14 g/g under a load, and an absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds, wherein the absorption capacity is more favorably not less than 27 g/g, still more favorably not less than 29 g/g, particularly favorably not less than 31 g/g, and wherein the suction index under a load is more favorably not less than 16 g/g, still more favorably not less than 18 g/g, particularly favorably not less than 20 g/g, and wherein the absorption rate is more favorably not more than 55 seconds, still more favorably not more than 50 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the particulate water-absorbing composition, as included in the absorbent layer of the absorbent article according to the present invention, favorably exhibits a color-difference (L, a, b) in which: L is not less than 40; the absolute value of a is not more than 6; and b is in the range of 0 to 15; wherein L is more favorably not less than 50; still more favorably not less than 60, and wherein the absolute value of a is more favorably not more than 5; still more favorably not more than 4, and wherein b is more favorably in the range of 0 to 14; still more favorably 0 to 13. A color-difference deviating from the above ranges has the disadvantage of being recognized as a foreign substance by consumers in the case of being used for diapers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As to the absorbent article according to the present invention, the above modes are favorable, but one of particularly favorable modes is an absorbent article which comprises an absorbent layer, a liquid-permeable surface sheet, and a liquid-impermeable back sheet, wherein the absorbent layer includes an absorbent structure such that the weight ratio of the particulate water-absorbing composition to the total of hydrophilic fibers and the particulate water-absorbing composition is not less than 0.3, and which is characterized in that the particulate water-absorbing composition includes a water-absorbent resin comprising a crosslinked poly(acrylic acid (salt)) as the main component and has the following properties: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> an offensive-odor removal index of not less than 180; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> a suction index of not less than 14 under a load; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> a color-difference (L, a, b) in which: L is not less than 40; the absolute value of a is not more than 6; and b is in the range of 0 to 15; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> an absorption capacity of 25 to 60 g/g; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> an absorption rate of not more than 60 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In a process for producing this absorbent article, for example, the particulate water-absorbing composition is blended or sandwiched with a fibrous material to prepare an absorbent layer (absorbent core), and the resultant absorbent core is sandwiched between a liquid-permeable base material (surface sheet) and a liquid-impermeable base material (back sheet), and the resultant product is, if necessary, provided with materials such as an elastic member, a diffusion layer, or a pressure sensitive adhesive tape, thus obtaining an absorbent article, particularly, a disposable diaper for adults or a sanitary napkin. The above absorbent core is, for example, subjected to compression forming so as to have a density of 0.06 to 0.50 g/cc and a basis weight of 0.01 to 0.20 g/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Incidentally, examples of usable fibrous materials include hydrophilic fibers such as pulverized wood pulp, and other examples include cotton linters, crosslinked cellulose fibers, rayon, wadding, wool, acetate, and vinylon. Preferably, they may be air-laid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Favorable examples of the above hydrophilic fibers include mechanically pulverized wood pulp, chemical pulp, kraft pulp, cotton, rayon, wadding, wool, acetate, vinylon, polyolefin fibers, and polyester fibers. These fibers may be used either alone respectively or in combination with each other so as to have such as laminate structures or core-sheath structures. Of the above fibers, those of which the surfaces are hydrophobic are subjected to hydrophilization treatment before being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In addition, hydrophilic fibers which are obtained from plants are fibrous, not powdery. It is generally a fine-thread-shaped substance that is referred to as &ldquo;fibrous&rdquo;, and such a substance favorably has an aspect ratio value larger than the aspect ratio range of the plant fiber as referred to in the present invention. The aspect ratio is a value as calculated from the following equation: aspect ratio&equals;length/breadth wherein the length and the breadth are those of the hydrophilic fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As is aforementioned, the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention can provide the deodorizing function to absorbent articles and exhibits excellent deodorizability and excellent absorption properties for a long time. Specific examples of such absorbent articles include sanitary materials such as disposable diapers for adults, which greatly develop in recent years, diapers for children, sanitary napkins, and so-called incontinent pads, but there is no especial limitation thereto. The particulate water-absorbing composition, as included in the absorbent article, has very excellent deodorizability and gel stability, and the absorbent article displays little desorption (wet back) and therefore gives a great dryness feeling, whereby the burden on wearers of the absorbent article or on people who take care of the wearers can greatly be lessened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In addition, the absorbent structure, according to the present invention, comprises a hydrophilic fiber, a plant powder, and a water-absorbent resin; and is characterized by exhibiting an offensive-odor removal index of not less than 180 as a particulate water-absorbing composition including a mixture of the plant powder and the water-absorbent resin, wherein the offensive-odor removal index is represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>offensive-odor removal index&equals;1.1&times;hydrogen sulfide removal ratio&plus;2.0&times;methylmercaptan removal ratio&plus;0.3&times;ammonia removal ratio. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The above wording &ldquo;as a particulate water-absorbing composition including a mixture of the plant powder and the water-absorbent resin&rdquo; means &ldquo;as a particulate water-absorbing composition which is obtained in the case where the plant powder and the water-absorbent resin are mixed together in a weight ratio appropriate to the use for the absorbent structure&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As to the absorbent structure according to the present invention, the plant powder and the water-absorbent resin may separately be put into the absorbent structure. The absorbent structure, according to the present invention, favorably comprises the particulate water-absorbing composition in which the plant powder is held by the water-absorbent resin. Namely, it favorable that at least parts of the plant powder and the water-absorbent resin, which are included in the absorbent structure, are in the form where the plant powder is held by the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention is more specifically illustrated by the following examples of some preferred embodiments in comparison with comparative examples not according to the invention. However the present invention is not limited to these examples. Incidentally, the various properties of water-absorbent resins and the volume-average particle diameter of plant powders were measured according to the following methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> (a) Absorption Capacity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> To a bag (60 mm&times;60 mm) made by nonwoven fabric, 0.2 g of water-absorbent resin (or particulate water-absorbing composition) was uniformly added, and then immersed in 100 g of aqueous sodium chloride solution of 0.9 weight % (physiological saline) of which the temperature had been adjusted to 25&deg; C. The bag was pulled up after 60 minutes, and the weight (W2 (g)) of the bag was measured after removing water with a centrifugal separator (250 G) for 3 minutes. In addition, the same procedure was carried out without using the water-absorbent resin, and the resultant weight (W1 (g)) of the bag was measured. Then, the absorption capacity (g/g) of the water-absorbent resin was calculated from these weights W1 and W2 in accordance with the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the measurement apparatus comprises: a receptacle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (No. 2, produced by Advantech, diameter&equals;90 mm, ten pieces); and a measurement part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The receptacle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contains 25 g of artificial urine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (of which the composition is as follows: 97.1 g of deionized water, 1.9 g of urea, 0.8 g of sodium chloride, 0.1 g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and 0.1 g of calcium chloride) wherein the temperature of the artificial urine is adjusted to 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The measurement part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> wherein the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is attached at the bottom of the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then, the measurement part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed by mounting the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (namely, the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) on the filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in this order, and further mounting the weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> inside the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, namely, on the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter of the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in 60 mm. The wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made of stainless steel and formed in 400 mesh (mesh opening size: 38 &mgr;m). The total weight of the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is adjusted to 62 g. Then, an arrangement is made such that a predetermined amount of water-absorbent resin (or particulate water-absorbing composition) can uniformly be spread on the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is adjusted in weight such that a load of 1.96 kPa can uniformly be applied to the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in other words, to the water-absorbent resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The suction power under a load and the suction index under a load were measured with the measurement apparatus having the above-mentioned constitution. The measurement methods are hereinafter explained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> First of all, the filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was mounted on the receptacle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, 25 g of the artificial urine <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of which the temperature has been adjusted to 25&deg; C. is added thereto so that the filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will absorb it. On the other hand, in parallel with this mounting operation, 1.0 g of water-absorbent resin (or particulate water-absorbing composition) was uniformly spread inside the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, namely, on the wire net <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> was put on this water-absorbent resin. Then, the weight of the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including the water-absorbent resin and the weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> was measured (as weight W1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Next, the above supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (on which the water-absorbent resin and the weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> had been mounted) was mounted on the center of the filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Then, the artificial urine got sucked over a period of 60 minutes since the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> had been mounted on the filter paper <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After 60 minutes, the weight of the supporting cylinder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including the water-absorbent resin (which had sucked the artificial urine) and the weight <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> was measured (as weight W2).

<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention is a new particulate water-absorbing composition which can provide the deodorizing function to absorbent articles and exhibits excellent deodorizability and excellent absorption properties for a long time. Although not clear, the cause is considered to be probably that since the water-absorbent resin is limited to such as exhibits the specific absorption capacity, suction power under a load, and absorption rate and since such a water-absorbent resin is provided with the plant powder, the optimum balance between the action of effective components of the plant powder and the liquid absorption quantity upon contact with urine has been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the above absorbent article according to the present invention includes the particulate water-absorbing composition according to the present invention and can therefore be provided with excellent deodorizability of this composition, this absorbent article is favorably usable particularly for sanitary materials such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinent pads for adults, and diapers for adults, and can be what is able to retain an excellent wearing feeling for a long time because of further being provided with the gel stability. </paragraph>
