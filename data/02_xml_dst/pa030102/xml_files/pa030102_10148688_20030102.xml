<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for transmitting Web pages for a virtual exhibition space from a Web server to a user terminal such as a personal computer connected to the Internet, and for displaying the Web pages on said personal computer. This display screen enables users to collect specific product information with ease. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of the conventional method for by which a consumer collects data concerning specific products. The specific product in this example is studless tires. When collecting data regarding the features and prices of studless tires of various brands and various manufacturers, a user of the conventional method begins by looking for exhibitions held exclusively on studless tires. Ordinarily, however, there are no exhibitions held only on studless tires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hence, the user of the conventional system must then attend large-scale exhibitions, such as motor shows. However, in this case, the user must be available during the limited time period of the exhibition and moreover must walk around a large convention center, browsing the display booths of each company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an individual can search for the home pages of companies on the Internet. In this case, the user inputs keywords such as &ldquo;studless tire&rdquo; or the manufacturer&apos;s name and selects from among various addresses found in the search. Next, the user displays the Website of, for example, Company A and follows links on that Website to various pages for studless tires. The user can download and save the necessary product data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Next, the user must view the Website of Company B and repeat the same operations performed for Company A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The user must repeat this procedure for each company and edit the data format for each company in order to compare data. When necessary, the user must order material, such as catalogs of merchandise, to be sent by mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system that is (1) able to transmit Web pages for a virtual exhibition from a Web server to a user&apos;s personal computer that is connected to the Internet, with said Web pages to be displayed on said personal computer, and (2) able to easily collect product information through simple operations performed by the user. Here the user accesses the display on the user&apos;s personal computer and uses a database in which product information is presorted according to business type and further sorted by specific products for each company, enabling the user to take part in a virtual exhibition held exclusively for a single specific product, such as studless tires, and thereby to compare the products of various company. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These objects will be attained by the present invention&apos;s virtual exhibition system, which is (1) capable of transmitting a Web page for a virtual exhibition from a Web server to a user&apos;s terminal, such as a personal computer, that is connected to the Internet, and (2) capable of displaying the Web page on the user&apos;s terminal, enabling the user to collect product information from the displayed Web page. The system comprises (1) a virtual-exhibition database that is provided with a folder for each of a plurality of categories denoting types of businesses, and that is used to classify companies&apos; exhibited product data that is entered in a virtual exhibition, and that stores files with thematic names of the virtual exhibitions that denote a category of products or their technologies and that identify product types that further classify the exhibited product data in each category; (2) a product-information database for storing a large volume of product data, such as videos and images, released by companies for such exhibitions; (3) virtual exhibiting means for (a) reading data from the virtual-exhibition database, (b) displaying a screen corresponding to a user&apos;s selection when the user selects, on the user&apos;s terminal, either one of the categories or one of the thematic names of the virtual exhibitions from the Web page, (c) for displaying booths in a virtual exhibition comprising companies that entered products under the thematic name selected by the user, and (d) displaying exhibit data edited in a uniform format for a company selected by the user; and (4) product-information displaying means for reading data from the product-information database and for displaying a screen of product information, including video and images, when the user requests more-detailed information for a product after selecting a booth in the virtual exhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the virtual exhibition system recited in claim 1 further comprises a virtual-negotiation-room means for enabling a user and a company participating in the exhibition to conduct a highly confidential discussion over an Internet communication line about a product exhibited by the company when the user &ldquo;visits&rdquo; (i.e., selects) the company&apos;s booth in the virtual exhibition and selects &ldquo;Negotiation Room&rdquo; from the screen displayed on the user&apos;s terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, the virtual-negotiation-room means transmits a negotiation request to a representative of the company via the Web page when the user selects &ldquo;Negotiation Room;&rdquo; allows negotiations to commence between the user and the representative after the representative sends to the user a conversation application that includes a built-in encryption key and logs into a private-conversation Web page at a preset date and time and the user receives the reply from the representative and also logs into the private-conversation Web page at the preset date and time using the conversation application, providing both the representative and the user input-correct passwords when the system prompts for password input; and automatically deletes all data related to the conversation application from the system after receiving a signal indicating the conversation has ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, the user can participate in a workshop, an open forum, or the like via a Web page that is displayed after the user first selects &ldquo;Participate in a Convention&rdquo; in the initial Web page displayed on the user&apos;s terminal and then selects either &ldquo;Virtual Seminar&rdquo; or &ldquo;Virtual Forum.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, the user can participate via a Web page in a virtual hall involving a drawing or sales promotion by first selecting &ldquo;Event Halls&rdquo; in the initial Web page displayed on the user&apos;s terminal and then selecting a hall.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The user selects one of the items listed in the Web page <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The Web server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives a signal for this selection, transfers the signal to the virtual exhibition server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, contacts the virtual-exhibition database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and displays the Web page corresponding to the selection (virtual exhibiting means). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a Web page <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> displayed at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the Web page <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> displays virtual booths for specific products and technologies within the scope of the selected category. The example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is displayed when the user selects the category &ldquo;Computers&rdquo; and the virtual exhibition theme &ldquo;State-of-the-Art Mobile-Computers Exhibit.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A group of booths in the virtual exhibition are displayed on the screen. In this example, virtual booths <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>are displayed for companies participating in the exhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> By selecting one of the participating companies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, the user can &ldquo;visit&rdquo; (i.e., select) the booth for that company so as to view a display of the company&apos;s specific products and to collect exhibit data. Because exhibit data is provided by each participating company and is edited in a uniform format, the user can easily compare and study data for various companies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The virtual-exhibition database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>a is configured with files for each virtual-exhibition theme that is stored in a folder for each category name. Hence, the database is configured in a hierarchical structure that facilitates browsing. If the user wishes to collect more-detailed information about a specific product, the user opens a booth for a single participating company among the group of booths and selects a button requesting detailed information in a Web page. The Web server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives a signal for this request, transfers the signal to the product-information-display server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, contacts the product-information database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and displays a Web page corresponding to the selection (product-information displaying means). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> From this display, the user can collect a large volume of detailed data&mdash;including videos, color images, and the like&mdash;submitted by the participating company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the user wishes to negotiate for the possible purchase of a product, the user can select the &ldquo;Negotiation Room&rdquo; on a screen displayed after opening a booth for a particular company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After receiving a signal for this request, the Web server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transfers the signal to the virtual-negotiating-room server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The virtual-negotiating-room server transfers the user&apos;s request to a representative of the participating company. After receiving this request, the representative sends to the user a conversation application with a built-in encryption key and logs into a private-conversation Web page at a prearranged date and time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After receiving the reply from the representative, the user uses the conversation application to log into the private-conversation Web page at the preset date and time. If both the representative and user log into the conversation Web page at this time, the virtual-negotiating-room server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the system end requests that each input a password. If the passwords are correct, the user and representative can begin negotiating on a private-conversation Web page <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the private-conversation Web page <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The private-conversation Web page <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a space <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for inputting transmission content, a space <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for displaying output of the conversation, transmission and cancel buttons <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for transmitting or canceling transmission of the content in the space <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and a &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for terminating the conversation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has been selected to end the conversation, a signal transmitted from that button causes the virtual-negotiating-room server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to remove all data for the conversation and the log by automatically uninstalling the conversation application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, security for maintaining confidentiality of the conversation is increased by transmitting a single-use conversation application with a built-in encryption key for each conversation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Here, we return to the Web page <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to describe the remaining selection buttons. The numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>d indicates a selection button for &ldquo;attending&rdquo; a convention. When this button is selected a Web page is displayed, enabling the user to further select a virtual seminar or a virtual forum in which to participate. In these screens the user can participate in a workshop or an open forum, respectively. </paragraph>
