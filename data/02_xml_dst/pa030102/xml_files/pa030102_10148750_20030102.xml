<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for producing a tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate and a process for producing a 4-aminotetrahydropyran compound from the tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate. The tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate is a useful compound for introducing a tetrahydropyranyl group into various compounds by substitution of a sulfonyl group, and the 4-aminotetrahydropyran compound is a useful compound as a synthetic intermediate or a starting material for medicines, agricultural chemicals, and the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As a process for producing a tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate from 3-buten-1-ol, there has been known a process for producing it by two steps through a tetrahydropyran-4-ol, for example, 3-buten-1-ol and formalin are reacted in the presence of sulfuric acid to synthesize the tetrahydropyran-4-ol with a yield of 76% (Chem. Ber., 88, p.1053 (1955)), and then, in the presence of a base, the tetrahydropyran-4-ol and methanesulfonyl chloride are reacted to synthesize a tetrahydropyranyl-4-methanesulfonate with an yield of 35% (J. Chem. Soc., 1952, p.910), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, as a process for producing a 4-aminotetrahydropyran compound, there have been known, for example, a method of contacting an ammonia gas and a hydrogen gas with a tetrahydropyran-4-one in the presence of Raney Nickel (Helv. Chim. Acta, 47, 2145 (1964)), a method of reacting a tetrahydropyran-4-one and an amine in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride (J. Med. Chem., 37, 565 (1994)), a method of heating a tetrahydropyran-4-one in a mixed solution of water, N,N-dimethylformamide and formic acid (Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. Hei.11-263764) and the like. However, the tetrahydropyran-4-one is a compound synthesis of which is relatively difficult and is a compound extremely unstable to a base and troublesome in handling since it is ring-opened easily and forms polymers, and there is a problem that an yield of the objective 4-aminotetrahydropyrane compound is low in either of the methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there is disclosed a method in which a 4-chlorotetrahydropyrane and ammonia in an autoclave at 200&deg; C. (J. Org. Chem., 36, 522 (1971)), but the reaction conditions thereof are extremely strict and there is a problem of low yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate, which is industrially advantageous, from an easily available 3-buten-1-ol without requiring any complicated operations, with a simple and easy method and which is capable of producing the tetrahydropyranyl-4-sulfonate with one step and high yield. </paragraph>
