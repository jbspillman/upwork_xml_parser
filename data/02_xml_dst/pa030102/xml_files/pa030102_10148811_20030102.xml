<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This presentation discloses an invention relating to a reader for an electromagnetic radiation detection element and an image sensor including such a reader. The invention also relates to a read process that could be implemented by this reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An image reader means a device capable of transforming an electronic signal supplied by one or several electromagnetic radiation detection elements into a signal that can be used to represent or record an image, or at least an element of an image (pixel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention is used for applications in different types of image sensors, for example such as cameras. These image sensors may be equipped with detection elements in the form of field effect diodes or elements (MOSFET). In particular, the invention may be used for devices equipped with a sensitive retina integrated in thin layers (TFA Thin Film on Asic). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention is also used for applications in the instrumentation (spectroscopic, etc.) and robotics (sensors) fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The state of the art closest to the invention is described in document (1), for which the complete reference is given at the end of the description. It is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, extracted from document (1) and described below to facilitate understanding of the rest of the presentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an electrical diagram of a reader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> associated with an electromagnetic radiation detection element. The detection element shown in the form of a diode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is associated with an impedance matching circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or an input stage, designed essentially to polarize the diode and collect the charges that are generated in it by radiation. The detection element, in the event diode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is capable of converting electromagnetic radiation, for example visible or infrared light, or y radiation, into a current of electrical charges. The charge current denoted I<highlight><subscript>ph </subscript></highlight>in the figure is transmitted through the impedance matching circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the reader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself. (The reader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is usually also called the preamplifier-integrator). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The reader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises integration means in the form of a capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The capacitor is charged by the electronic current I<highlight><subscript>ph </subscript></highlight>in an integration phase and there is a voltage denoted V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>at its terminals. The voltage V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>represents the intensity of the radiation flux received by the detection element during the integration phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected to a terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> supplies a detection signal that varies linearly with the voltage V<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>. The amplifier in particular connects the terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the capacitor to a read signal bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is considered as being a constituent of an output stage from the reader or as forming part of such an output stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also connected to the inverter input of a comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The comparator is designed to compare the voltage V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>with a set voltage V<highlight><subscript>comp </subscript></highlight>and to control opening of a switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> when the voltage V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>goes above the set voltage threshold V<highlight><subscript>comp</subscript></highlight>. When the switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is open, the reader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is isolated from the detection element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Opening the switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> also interrupts integration of the current in the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and prevents a reader saturation phenomenon when the radiation flux received by the detection element is very intense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that the rate of the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is controlled by a &ldquo;Clock&rdquo; signal such that opening the switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also has to be validated by a synchronization pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Synchronization pulses are also produced for initialization of the reader before each new integration phase. These pulses then temporarily close a switch <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected between the terminals of the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to discharge it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to one interesting feature of the reader, it also comprises a timed indication stage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> capable of outputting a signal representing the duration of each integration phase. Essentially, this signal is provided by a second capacitor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connected to a time signal bus <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through an amplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to a charge voltage source V<highlight><subscript>ramp </subscript></highlight>through a switch <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which is also opened under the control of the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> By combining the sampled voltage blocked by the time indication stage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (integration time T<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>) and the voltage integrated in the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (integrated photocharge Q<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>), it is then possible to obtain the value

<heading lvl="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the invention is to propose a reader operating essentially on the principle of the reader described above, and which has improved operating characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One purpose in particular is to propose such a reader with low reading noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another purpose is to propose such a reader with improved sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> There is another purpose related to the previous purpose, which is to propose such a reader that can operate with a low capacity integration capacitor, and that can therefore reduce the surface area of the integration capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another purpose of the invention is to propose a read process and a sensor, or detection device, using one or several readers conform with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve these purposes, more precisely the invention relates to a reader for an electromagnetic radiation detection element comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> at least one electrical charge integration capacitor that can be connected to at least one electromagnetic radiation detection element, to output a voltage that it is a function of the electrical charges supplied by the said detection element, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> an amplifier connected between the capacitor and an output stage from the reader, the amplifier having a high impedance terminal connected to the integration capacitor and a low impedance terminal connected to the output stage, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> comparator means for isolating the integration capacitor from the detection element when the voltage at the capacitor terminals is greater than a set value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the comparator means are connected to the low impedance terminal of the amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Since the comparator means are connected to the low impedance terminal of the amplifier, in other words to the terminal connected to the output stage, their input capacitance is not in parallel with the integration capacitor. The result is an increase in the current-voltage conversion factor, creating better sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The available voltage at the output from the amplifier reflects the voltage at the capacitor terminals. Therefore, it is used to determine whether or not it exceeds a given value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the amplifier does not amplify an input noise inherent to the comparator means and to a comparison voltage source applied to these means, if any. This can significantly reduce noise transferred to the output stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to an improvement to the reader, a switch can be connected between the low impedance terminal of the amplifier and the comparator means, to connect the comparator means to the amplifier during an integration phase and to isolate the comparator means from the amplifier during a read phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Due to this improvement, the comparator means may be completely isolated from the amplifier and from the output stage to protect the output stage from noise generated by these means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to another improvement of the reader, an additional switch may be connected between the amplifier and the output stage, to connect the output stage to the amplifier in a read phase and to isolate the output stage from the amplifier in an integration phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This improvement has a number of advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> During the integration phase, the low impedance output from the reader is charged solely by the input capacitance in the low capacitance comparator, which gives a low reader polarization current and hence low consumption of the device. On the other end, during the read phase, the low impedance output of the reader is connected to the output stage through a high capacitance bus. The result is a high polarization current to charge the output stage, but only for a short instant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The final result is a reduction in the electrical consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A reader according to the invention may be common to several radiation detection elements. However, it is preferable to associate an individual reader with each image sensor detection element. One possibility for high level integration of the reader made available as a result of the invention, is that radiation detection elements and readers can be associated with each other. They are associated in a retina in which each elementary point comprises a detection element and a reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment of the amplifier used to apply an input to the output stage, the output stage may be built around a field effect transistor polarized as a follower source. The transistor is polarized by a low intensity polarization current source and may be connected elsewhere to a read bus that forms the output stage, or at least part of it. In this case, the polarization current source is connected in parallel with a polarization source of the read bus, if any. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a process for reading a detection element, for example a quantic or thermal detection element, using a reader like that described. The process comprises an alternating succession of integration phases and read phases. The comparator means are connected to the amplifier during integration phases, and the comparator means are isolated during read phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, it is also possible to connect the amplifier to the output stage during read phases, and to isolate it from the output stage during integration phases, either as a complementary or alternative feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clear from the following description with reference to the figures in the attached drawings. This description is given for illustrative purposes only and is in no way limitative.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A large number of elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are identical to or similar to the elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, already described. A complete description of the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and its components is not repeated here. Identical or similar parts are marked with the same references, in order to facilitate the reference to explanations that have already been given in the previous part of the text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mentioned above is connected to a low impedance output terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, instead of being connected to the terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the integration capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It should be remembered that the comparison voltage V&prime;<highlight><subscript>comp </subscript></highlight>applied to the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is different from the voltage V<highlight><subscript>comp </subscript></highlight>applied to the comparator in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The voltage V&prime;<highlight><subscript>comp </subscript></highlight>applied to the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> must take account of the transfer characteristic of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this case, the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> performs two functions. Obviously, a first function is to modify the output level of the reader characterized by the amplification gain. A second function is impedance matching. The impedance of an input terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is higher than the impedance of an output terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The input and output terminals are thus denoted as the high impedance and low impedance terminals respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By connecting the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a low impedance terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the noise associated with reading the voltage V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>of the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Furthermore, injection of charges from the detection element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a parasite input capacitance of the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The reader in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises two additional switches <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, apart from the switches <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> already described in relation with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The first additional switch <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected between the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the low impedance terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the amplifier. When the switch <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is open, it completely isolates the comparator from the amplifier, and also from the output stage. In the example in the figure, the output stage is formed by the read signal bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This measurement eliminates all noise that could be generated by the comparator from the reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The second additional switch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected between the low impedance terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the read bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Its first role is to prevent a short circuit between all low impedance terminals of the readers connected to the same bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A second role of this switch is related to a reduction in the energy consumption of the reader. It will be described more clearly in the reminder of the description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The rate at which the reader operates is controlled by a clock synchronization circuit that is only shown symbolically on the figures by arrows marked Ck. Operation essentially includes two phases, namely the integration phase and the read phase. During the integration phase, the current I<highlight><subscript>ph </subscript></highlight>charges the capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, at least until the switches <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> mentioned above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are open. The voltage V<highlight><subscript>int</subscript></highlight>, available at the capacitor terminals and amplified by the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is read during the read phase, in other words is transferred onto the read bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the voltage at the capacitor terminals <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is read on the bus of the time signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Operation of the time indication stage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is exactly the same as the operation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A stage of this type is described in document (1), mentioned above, which should be referred to. In particular, it can be noted that the capacitor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of stage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is charged by a voltage ramp generator, also during the integration phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> described below shows a particular embodiment of the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> used in the reader according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the amplifier <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises a transistor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the drain of which is connected to a power supply voltage denoted Vdd in which the grid is connected to a terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the integration capacitor, and the source of which is polarized by a current source <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The transistor source is also connected to the terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to which the comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the output stage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The current source <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> outputs a low intensity current denoted I<highlight><subscript>pel</subscript></highlight>. Since the second additional switch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is opened during the integration phase in order to avoid charging the read bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the transistor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> only carries a low intensity current I<highlight><subscript>pel</subscript></highlight>. On the other hand, during the read phase, the switch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is closed and the current source <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in parallel with a polarization source of the read bus <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This source, shown in discontinuous lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is marked with reference <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. It outputs a current I<highlight><subscript>col </subscript></highlight>with an intensity very much greater than I<highlight><subscript>pel</subscript></highlight>. This source is input to the read bus with a matched compliance. Compliance means the ability to output a current that can be used to set up a signal in a given time on a given capacitive charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Due to these characteristics, the consumption of the amplification means and therefore the reader may be particularly low. A low consumption results in better integration of the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The reader according to the invention is particularly suitable for junction type detection elements of the MOS type or the charge transfer device type (CCD). </paragraph>
