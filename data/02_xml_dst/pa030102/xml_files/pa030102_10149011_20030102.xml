<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical acoustoelectric transducer for converting vibration displacement of a vibrating board into an electric signal by using light. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There is a microphone as an acoustoelectric transducer. In general, in order to provide sharp directivity for sensitivity in an incident direction of a sound wave vertical to a vibrating board of the microphone, it is necessary to configure a microphone apparatus so as to have the sound wave incident not only on a front portion but also on a back portion of the vibrating board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As for a dynamic microphone broadly used in the past, it has a configuration wherein a coil is mounted on the vibrating board in order to detect the sound wave from the vibrating board, and so the coil and so on resist sound pressure entering from the back so that the vibrating board cannot always be vibrated as on the front. It was difficult, however, to provide the configuration wherein the front portion and the back portion of the vibrating board are completely opened so as to render the sound wave incident from both the front portion and the back portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, as for a condenser microphone, it has the configuration wherein, as it detects the sound wave by detecting change of capacity due to vibration of the vibrating board, the back cannot be structurally opened to render the sound wave incident from the backside. Accordingly, it is ideal that the acoustoelectric transducer such as the microphone has nothing on its back as on its front. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an optical microphone apparatus using an optical device is known as one of the microphones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For instance, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-297011 discloses an optical fiber sensor using a pair of optical fibers and having a configuration wherein light is irradiated to a vibration medium from one optical fiber connected to a light source and the light is detected by the other optical fiber, indicating that it is applicable to a microphone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An optical microphone device used for the optical microphone apparatus is comprised of the vibrating board for vibrating due to sound pressure, the light-emitting device for irradiating a light beam on this vibrating board, and the light-receiving element for receiving reflected light from the vibrating board and outputting a signal corresponding to vibration displacement of the vibrating board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thereby it is possible to detect the vibration displacement of the vibrating board caused by the fact that the sound wave hits the vibrating board without touching this vibrating board and to convert the detected vibration displacement to an electric signal, so that it is no longer necessary to place a vibration detecting system on the vibrating board, weight of the vibrating portion can be rendered lighter, and feeble variation of the sound wave can be sufficiently followed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A first objective of the present invention is, for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned first problem, to provide the acoustoelectric transducer having the directivity, as its directional characteristic, only in the vertical direction to the vibrating board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, as for the microphone in the past, the apparatus is configured by using a single optical microphone device so that one vibrating board covers frequency characteristics ranging from low to high frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Such a microphone characteristic is generally called a monotone characteristic, where frequency coverage is actually almost limited to 50 Hz to 20 KHz as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, as the optical microphone apparatus in the past used a single optical microphone device using a single vibrating board, it is difficult to control the low to high frequencies with the single vibrating board so as to render the sensitivity (amplitude) thereof flat. In general, the sensitivity in a low frequency band is enhanced by increasing thickness of the vibrating board, and the sensitivity in a high frequency band is enhanced by decreasing the thickness thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is difficult, due to such a physical property of the vibrating board, to implement the optical microphone apparatus of which frequency characteristic of the sensitivity (amplitude) is flat over a wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second objective of the present invention is, for the purpose of solving such a second problem in the past, to provide the acoustoelectric transducer like the optical microphone apparatus of which sensitivity (amplitude) characteristic is flat over a wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in case of configuring the optical microphone apparatus of the wide frequency band by arranging a plurality of the past optical microphone devices, there is a fault that the vibrating board cannot be rendered close or the shape thereof becomes larger. For that reason, it is difficult to implement a small and wide-band directional microphone apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as the size of the vibrating board of the microphone apparatus is fixed, it is difficult to have settings with featured frequency characteristics and to implement the microphone apparatus which is efficient in the wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A third objective of the present invention is, for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned third problem, to provide the directional acoustoelectric transducer which is small and has the wide-band frequency characteristic. </paragraph>

And a light-emitting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are provided on the backside of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that an incident light beam L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reflected by the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be reflected light L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus, vibration displacement of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is detected, by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as change of a light-receptive position of the reflected light L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this case, a sound wave <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> gets incident from the front of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a sound wave <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> gets incident from the back thereof, where if the respective sound pressure phases are the same, no vibration occurs on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and no output is generated from the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case where the sound wave <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a&plus;b comes from the front direction of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the sound wave <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of a comes from the backside thereof, the sound wave a is canceled and only b is detected on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Here, in general ambient noise, noise and so on input from the front side and the backside of the microphone with the same phase and amplitude. Accordingly, this becomes the sound wave a. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a speech signal only gets incident as b from the front side of the microphone, and consequently only noise a is canceled by the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and only speech b is taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible, by implementing the configuration allowing the sound wave to come to the vibrating board from the front and the backside, to take out only the speech signal so as to reduce the noise. In addition, it is possible, by implementing such a configuration, to obtain the complete directional characteristic as shown by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are diagrams showing the configuration of the optical microphone apparatus which is an embodiment of the present invention I, where <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a exploded perspective view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a side view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side sectional view thereof respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the present invention I has the light-emitting device and the light-receiving element formed as one piece as the light emitting and light-receiving device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and mounted on a substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted close to the center of a bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed almost in parallel with and close to the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A supporting side plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for coupling this bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In addition, it is not always necessary to form this supporting side plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to totally surround the bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but it is also feasible, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to configure it by erecting supports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the periphery of the bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and connect a periphery <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to lower ends of these supports <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It has the configuration wherein the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on which the light-emitting and light-receiving device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted is connected to a terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and supply of power and delivery of necessary signals are performed to the light-emitting and light-receiving device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and peripheral circuits thereof via this terminal <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In addition, the present invention I has openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided to the bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to render the sound wave from the backside of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> incident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is also feasible, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to form these openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by providing a plurality of circular holes on a circumference to surround the light-emitting and light-receiving device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is possible, by forming such openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to induce the noise from the backside to the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is possible, in addition to the openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided on the bottom plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to also provide openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the supporting side plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as to allow the sound wave to enter as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, if the openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provided on the supporting side plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed to have excessively large opening area, the speech from the front of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> diffracts and gets incident on the backside thereof via these openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to cancel the speech, and so it is desirable to provide the openings of an adequate size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are diagrams showing another embodiment of the present invention I, that is, the diagrams showing the configuration of a head portion of the optical microphone device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a sectional shape, where an electronic circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided on a bottom <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of a container <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and a substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> on which the light-emitting device and the light-receiving element are placed is mounted on this board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. It can also be mounted by electrically connecting the substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by flip chip bonding for instance. In addition, it is possible, if the bottom <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is configured with a semiconductor substrate such as silicon, to omit the electronic circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> since an electronic circuit can be configured thereon. Moreover, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> uses a vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode LD as the light-emitting device and a photodiode PD as the light-receiving element. The vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode LD in a circular shape is placed in the middle of the substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and the light-receiving elements PD are concentrically provided to surround the LD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a plane showing enlarged light receptive and emitting portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> on which the light-emitting device and light-receiving elements shown as enclosed by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in the drawing, the light-emitting device LD in the circular shape is placed in the center, and the light-receiving elements PD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> . . . PD<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>are concentrically provided to surround it. Moreover, the vertical cavity surface emitting laser can be used as the light-emitting device LD used here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> These light-emitting devices LD and the light-receiving elements PD can be simultaneously manufactured on a gallium arsenide wafer by a semiconductor manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, alignment accuracy of the light-emitting devices LD and the light-receiving elements PD is determined by accuracy of a mask used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, and so it is possible, as the alignment accuracy thereof can be rendered as 1 &mgr;m or less, to implement it with high accuracy of a one millionth or less compared to the alignment accuracy of the light-emitting device and the light-receiving elements of optical microphone devices of the past. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In general, a vertical cavity surface emitting device has a characteristic that its intensity distribution of the light emission is concentrically almost even. Accordingly, radiated light that is radiated toward a vibrating board <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at a predetermined angle from the light-emitting device LD placed in the center is concentrically reflected with the same intensity, and its reflection angle is changed by vibration of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> due to reception of a sound wave <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> so that it concentrically reaches the light-receiving elements PD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the vibration displacement of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be detected by detecting the change of a received light amount of the concentrically placed light-receiving elements PD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> . . . PD<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. It becomes usable as the optical microphone device since it can thereby detect the intensity of the incident sound wave <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an electrode <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is formed in order to drive the light-emitting devices LD and the light-receiving elements PD or to detect an incident light amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is the same as the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the openings not shown are provided on a side wall and the bottom <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As this embodiment uses the light-emitting device and the light-receiving element using the vertical cavity surface emitting device (VCSEL) and the photodiode (PD) configured in a monolithic structure on the same plane, it is very small, able to secure large space on the backside of the vibrating board and eliminate a resistance to the sound pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention I is not limited to the optical microphone apparatus but is also applicable to an optical sensor. </paragraph>

It is configured so that a predetermined driving current is supplied to the light-emitting device of each of the optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from a light source driving circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are diagrams showing the configuration of the compound optical microphone device configured by combining the plurality of optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, where (a) shows a top view and (b) shows a side sectional view thereof respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are configured by having each of them sectioned by a shielding plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and are placed and fixed so as to position vibrating boards <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the plurality of optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> almost on the same plane as supporting frames <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Each optical microphone device is comprised of a light-emitting device <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a light-receiving element <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> mounted on the substrate not shown and the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> placed almost in parallel with and close to the substrate having the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> mounted thereon, having the configuration wherein the light beam from the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is reflected by the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> so that the signal corresponding to the vibration displacement of the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), each vibrating board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is placed to be exposed in the opening formed on a frame surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the supporting frames <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> These vibrating boards <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are placed to be located in the same plane as the frame surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and are fixed on the supporting frames <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a diagram showing the configuration of the light-emitting and light-receiving device of the optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> used in the present invention II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode LD and the light-receiving elements PD such as the photodiodes are placed on the gallium arsenide substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The laser diode LD is formed in the center of the substrate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of the light-receiving elements PD are concentrically formed to surround it. Electrodes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are taken out of the laser diode LD and the light-receiving elements PD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The vertical cavity surface emitting laser diode LD has the a characteristic that its intensity distribution of the light emission is concentrically almost even, where the laser beam concentrically radiated from this laser diode LD is concentrically reflected by the vibrating board, and it is received by the light-receiving elements PD to be taken out as a receiving signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as for the light-emitting and light-receiving device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the light-receiving elements can be taken out by differential output since they are concentrically formed on a plurality of circles, and it is thereby possible to absorb an error such as temperature change of the laser diode LD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Here, the vibrating board of the optical microphone device used in the present invention II will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a relationship between a thickness t and an amplitude characteristic of the vibrating board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, in the case where a frequency f of a wave-receptive sound wave is low, the thinner the thickness t of the vibrating board is, the larger the amplitude becomes. And if the frequency is high, the thicker the thickness t is, the smaller the amplitude becomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The present invention II utilizes this property so that the thickness of the respective vibrating boards of the plurality of optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> becomes different to have almost even receiving sensitivity in mutually different frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, a reproducible frequency range of the sound waves is limited for the vibrating board of each optical microphone device, so that the vibrating board of the thickness conforming to that frequency range is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an amplitude characteristic in the case where the thicknesses of the vibrating board of each optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are changed and the frequencies reproducible for each of them are dividedly assigned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> For instance, assignment is performed to the optical microphone device M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be able to reproduce the sound waves in the lowest frequency range, and to the optical microphone device M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to be able to reproduce the sound waves in the highest frequency range. In this case, it is necessary to render the vibrating board thickest for the optical microphone device M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to render it thinnest for the optical microphone device M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to obtain the amplitude characteristic as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> by selecting the thickness of the vibrating board so that, according to the frequency range assigned to each optical microphone device, the amplitude characteristic thereof becomes almost flat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the amplitude characteristics of the optical microphone devices M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are corresponding to A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to A<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It is possible to obtain the compound optical microphone device having the flat amplitude characteristic in the entire frequency range as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> by inputting the amplitude characteristics of the plurality of optical microphone devices to the mixer circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and synthesizing them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present invention, it is possible to implement the optical microphone apparatus of which frequency characteristic of the sensitivity from the mixer circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is almost flat in the range of 1 Hz to 100 KHz. In addition, it is possible to implement miniaturization by configuring the optical microphone device with the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) diode and the photodiode (PD) configured in a monolithic structure. For this reason, the miniaturization is possible even when the plurality of optical microphone devices are combined. </paragraph>

In addition, the light-emitting devices LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to LD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving elements PD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are mounted on light-emitting and light-receiving device mounting members <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> respectively. Supply of a driving current to the light-emitting devices LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to LD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and fetching of a light-receptive current form the light-receiving elements PD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to PD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are performed via an electronic circuit board <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in order to ensure coming of the sound waves to the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and provide directivity to the front and rear thereof, a large number of openings <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided to the cabinet <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the mounting members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> To be more specific, as the basic resonance frequency F<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is inversely proportional to a square of the radius of the vibrating board, a quadruple frequency can be obtained if the radius becomes half. Furthermore, in the case of the basic resonance frequency or a resonance frequency of even number times thereof, it becomes a division mode wherein the amplitude is the largest around the center thereof, and so the sensitivity becomes extremely high around the resonance frequency when the light is focused thereon. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the radiuses of the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are set to be 1:{square root}{square root over (3)}:{square root}{square root over (5)}:{square root}{square root over (9)}:{square root}{square root over (20)}, where the respective resonance frequencies are superimposed so as to cover a wide frequency band. Here, as the voice band is emphasized, the basic resonance frequency of the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is the highest is set at 100 Hz. Thus, the extremely high sensitivity is obtained in the range of approximately 100 to 3,000 Hz as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the space among the respective vibrating boards is large, deterioration of the directivity becomes worse even at low frequencies due to deviation of phases, and so it is desirable to place the vibrating boards with the spacing as narrow as possible. Here, it is set at approximately 2 mm so as to obtain stable sensitivity up to the frequency characteristic of 20 kHz or so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a sectional structure of the acoustoelectric transducer related to a second embodiment of the present invention III. This embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the light-emitting devices LD and the light-receiving elements PD are placed on the same mounting member <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Adoption of such a configuration allows the shape of the apparatus to be miniaturized compared to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the sectional structure of the acoustoelectric transducer related to a third embodiment of the present invention III. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the present invention III, the light-emitting devices and the light-receiving elements are placed on the same mounting member <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> as in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. While it is necessary, in the case of the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, to provide the small holes <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the closer vibrating boards just to pass the incident light and the reflected light, it is configured, by arranging the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to deviate sideward respectively, to prevent change of the shape of the vibrating boards (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and change of the frequency characteristics due to provision of such holes <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and to make small holes on mounting members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to pass the light. This makes it unnecessary to make small holes on the vibrating boards. In addition, in the case of the acoustoelectric transducer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, it is possible to use the vertical cavity surface emitting laser diodes (VCSEL) for the light-emitting device and use the light-emitting and light-receiving device wherein an arrangement is made to concentrically surround the device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> show a block diagram of the acoustoelectric transducer related to a fourth embodiment of the present invention III, where (a) shows a sectional view and (b) shows an external view thereof. This embodiment has all the vibrating boards (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) placed on a mounting members <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which are on the same plane. In addition, the light-emitting devices and light-receiving elements are placed likewise on the same mounting member <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> in correspondence with each vibrating board. It is possible, by adopting such a configuration, to render the vertical thickness smaller while the horizontal thickness increases. It is also feasible, in this embodiment, to use the light-emitting and light-receiving device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As a result of using the configuration described above, the directivity that can be finally obtained by synthesizing sensitivity characteristics from such a plurality of vibrating boards takes the form as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. While a gain is slightly impaired by the existence of other vibrating boards, the light-emitting devices and light-receiving elements and other components in the rear, it is possible to implement the acoustoelectric transducer having sharp directivity forward and backward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the case where the vibrating board is horizontally placed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, high frequency characteristics deteriorate compared to the one vertically placed, the forward and backward directional characteristics take almost the same form as the vertical one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is possible, by combining the plurality of optical microphone apparatuses, to configure a directional microphone apparatus of the wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> However, in such a configuration of the apparatus, the light-emitting devices and the vibrating boards are used at a ratio of 1:1 when combining the plurality of devices, and so a plurality of pairs of combinations of vibrating boards and light-emitting devices are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Thus, the apparatus of which relationship between the vibrating boards and the light-emitting devices is 1:1 has a problem that the vibrating boards cannot be closely placed or their shape becomes larger. Therefore, the present invention has the configuration, as a further improvement, wherein the plurality of vibrating boards are associated with one light-emitting device in order to implement the directional optical microphone apparatus of a small size and having wide-band frequency characteristics and reduce costs by decreasing the number of relatively expensive light-emitting devices used thereon. It is thereby possible to cut the number of the light-emitting devices so as to implement the optical acoustoelectric transducer of the small size and having the directivity of which frequency bandwidth is wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Hereafter, a concrete configuration thereof will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the acoustoelectric transducer showing a fifth embodiment related to the further improvement of the present invention III. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A plurality of vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are vertically placed and mounted step-wise in a cabinet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> And a single light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is mounted in the lower portion of these vertically placed vibrating board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition, the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are arranged and mounted on the same plane where the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is mounted respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Moreover, openings <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for rendering the sound waves from the outside incident are provided on an outer wall surface of the cabinet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the mounting members of the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and mounting plates of the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It is configured, by providing such openings <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, to have the sound waves incident from the front and back of the respective vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Thus, the optical microphone apparatus comes to have bi-directivity on the front and back of the vibrating boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is desirable to use the VCSEL as the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A laser beam radiated from the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> gets incident on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and is partially reflected and gets incident on the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In addition, a portion thereof passes through this vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and gets incident on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The light incident on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is also partially reflected here and gets incident on the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In addition, the light which passed through the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>gets incident on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and is reflected here and gets incident on the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is necessary to use a material having a half mirror effect for the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The shapes of the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are defined to have different acoustic resonance frequencies respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the respective vibrating boards have different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the small-sized vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has a higher resonance frequency, and the large-sized vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a lower resonance frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, the frequency characteristics obtained by using the vibrating boards having different shapes and totalizing output from the three vibrating boards are the wide-band frequency characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> That is, sound receiving characteristics are formed by synthesizing peak characteristics of three vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, to render the gain higher in a desired frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In addition, while output characteristics obtained by totalizing the output of the three light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are influenced by the other vibrating boards, the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the rear of the vibrating boards and a little gain is lost, it is possible, as the openings <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> allow the vibrating boards to vibrate freely, to have the sharp directivity forward and backward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is not always necessary to place the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the same plane in spite of their placement in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is sufficient to define the shapes of the plurality of vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to have different acoustic resonance frequencies respectively, not necessarily having to form them only to have different sizes, and it is also possible to change their thicknesses so as to form them to have different acoustic resonance frequencies respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the acoustoelectric transducer showing a sixth embodiment related to the further improvement of the present invention III. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> This embodiment has the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>placed on the same plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are placed on the same plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In addition, a half mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is placed in a predetermined position in the cabinet <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The light radiated from the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is partially reflected by the half mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, hits the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is reflected thereon to get incident on the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the portion of the light having passed through the half mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> gets incident on the vibrating board <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and is reflected thereon to get incident on the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The light thus irradiated from the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is distributed by the half mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and is reflected by the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to get incident on the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, it is possible to implement a further miniaturized acoustoelectric transducer since vertical length can be rendered shorter than the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is also possible, in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, to render the shapes of the vibrating boards <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>different so as to render the respective acoustic resonance frequencies different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The acoustic characteristics thus synthesized can render the gain even in the wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is possible, by using the VCSEL as the light-emitting device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, to render the diameter of the light-emitting beam extremely thin and set focal distance freely enough to provide a degree of freedom to the distance between the vibrating boards and the light-emitting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the above improved apparatus of the present invention III, it is possible to closely place the vibrating boards to one another and besides, to have the configuration having no obstacle between them so as to implement the microphone apparatus having the extremely sharp directivity and the frequency characteristics extended to high frequencies by totalizing the bi-directivity of the respective vibrating boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> While the configurations of the present invention I to III were described in detail above by taking the optical microphone apparatus as an example, it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited to the optical microphone apparatus but is applicable to an acoustic sensor and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As described in detail above based on the embodiments, it is possible, according to the present invention I, to provide the openings on the bottom plate having the light-emitting and light-receiving device placed thereon provided opposite the vibrating boards so as to primarily render the noise incident on the vibrating boards and thereby reduce the noise. And it is also possible to render a directional pattern close to an ideal shape like a letter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the present invention II, it is possible to implement the acoustoelectric transducer of which amplitude characteristic is almost even over the wide frequency band because an acoustoelectric transducing device compounded by combining a plurality of acoustoelectric transducing devices is configured and the thicknesses of the respective vibrating boards of the plurality of acoustoelectric transducing devices are combined to render the receiving sensitivity almost even in different frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is possible to widely utilize the acoustoelectric transducer of the present invention as the microphone apparatus for music suitable for the future digital age. In addition, it can be used not only as the microphone apparatus but also as the acoustic sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention III, it is possible to implement the acoustoelectric transducer of good directivity which is small-sized and has wide-band characteristics by adopting the configuration wherein the plurality of vibrating boards are placed on the same plane or on different planes and the light-emitting and light-receiving device is provided in correspondence therewith. In addition, it is possible to implement the apparatus capable of changing the sizes of the respective vibrating boards to change the frequency characteristics and gathering sound efficiently in the wide frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is possible, by using the VCSEL as the light-emitting device, to render the diameter of the light-emitting beam extremely thin and thereby set focal distance relatively freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is possible to provide the degree of freedom to the distance between the vibrating boards and the light-emitting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to place the plurality of vibrating boards very closely to one another and besides, to have no obstacle among them so as to implement the acoustoelectric transducer having the extremely sharp directivity and the characteristics extended to the wide frequencies by totalizing the bi-directivity of the individual vibrating boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible, in the case of using the vibrating boards of different diameters, to arbitrarily change the frequency characteristics by differences in the resonance frequencies determined by the diameters of the vibrating boards. Accordingly, it is possible to implement the directional acoustoelectric transducer of extremely high sensitivity by using the most efficient band. Moreover, it is possible to implement the directional acoustoelectric transducer having an advantage in terms of costs by further improving it to place the plurality of vibrating boards to one light-emitting device. </paragraph>
