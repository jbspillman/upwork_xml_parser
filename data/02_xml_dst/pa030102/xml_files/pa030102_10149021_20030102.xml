<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Since iterative decoding of turbo codes or SCCC outputs provisional decoded result and likelihood information in the course of the decoding process, effective use of this makes it possible to implement interference cancellation without marked increase in the amount of operations for decoding. For this purpose, decoding of a plurality of turbo code signals or SCCC blocks interfering with one another is implemented in parallel so that iterative decoding is performed making use of the decoded data and likelihood information obtained as the transitive decoding result of turbo codes or SCCC, to decode other blocks. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to digital communications using an error correction technique. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, rapid development has been found in the industries field relating to digital communications such as the Internet, digital cellular phones. Under such circumstances, basic studies for high-speed high-quality communications of information of importance have been intensively made. Of these studies, error correction techniques are part and parcel of establishment of high-quality communications using unstable communications paths such as digital mobile communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Turbo-coding is remarkable error correction codes that enable high-quality data communications to be made with a lesser amount of energy and have drawn wide attraction in recent years. In the field of digital mobile communications, this technique is highly expected to be adopted as a next-generation standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the field of the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technique, which is also expected to be a next-generation standard, the technique of interference cancellation for reducing interference has markedly drawn attraction because the capacity of the system is limited depending on the amount of interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Turbo coding is a new coding scheme published in 1993, and is constructed of a combination of two (or more than two) kinds of systematic convolutional coding (C.Berrou et al. &ldquo;Near Shannon Limit error-correcting coding: Turbo codes&rdquo;, Proceedings of ICF93 or &ldquo;Near Optimum error-correcting coding: Turbo codes&rdquo;, IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol.44,no.10,1996). The decoding process of turbo codes is featured by reducing errors by successively repeating decoding operations of these two kinds of systematic convolutional codes. Here, the configuration of the Turbo encoder and decoder and its decoding method will be described briefly. For detailed information, reference should be made to Isaka et al., &lsquo;Fingerpost to Shannon limit: &ldquo;parallel concatenated (Turbo) coding&rdquo;, &ldquo;Turbo (iterative) decoding&rdquo; and its surroundings&rsquo;, Technical Report IT98-51 of The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers, J.Hagenauer &ldquo;Iterative Decoding of Binary Block and Convolutional Codes&rdquo;, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol.42, No.2 1996, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An encoder for turbo codes is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and a block diagram of its decoder is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Two recursive systematic convolutional code (RSCC) encoders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided in parallel with an interleaver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. An original information bit sequence X is rearranged into an interleaved stream, which is input to the second encoder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Now, provided that the coding rate of the recursive systematic convolutional encoder is &frac12;, parity bits Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are obtained from respective encoders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, are added to the original information bit X, to produce a turbo code with a coding rate of &frac13;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the decoder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> decoder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> first performs decoding of the first systematic convolutional codes, then the decoded result, after being processed through an interleaver <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is supplied to a decoder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, where decoding of the second systematic convolutional codes is performed. This result is further processed through deinterleaver <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be supplied to decoder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where decoding of the first systematic convolutional codes is performed again. This iterative decoding gradually improves the reliability of decoded symbols and reduces errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In decoding of systematic convolutional codes implemented in the process of the turbo coding, it is necessary to have the decoded result in addition with soft-decision information in order for it to be used for the subsequent decoding step. Decoder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to RSCC1, receives the signal (Lc y) that is obtained by having the received symbols weighted in proportion to the SNR (signal to noise ratio) and extrinsic information (likelihood information) and outputs the decoded result L(u) with the logarithm of likelihood ratio and extrinsic information L<highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight>(u) which is passed over to the subsequent decoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There are several decoding methods which can provide soft-decision result. Here, the MAP will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> MAP (Maximum A Posteriori Probability) decoding is one that determines, for each information symbol uk, the uk which will maximize the P(uk) under a condition where a received signal sequence y is given, as the decoded result. For this purpose, LLR (logarithm likelihood ratio: L(uk)) is determined in the following equation (1)

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Here, in the above-described turbo encoder, two systematic convolutional encoders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are used in parallel with an interleaver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in between, but two systematic convolutional encoders <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be used serially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to construct a serial concatenation of interleaved codes (SCCC), which also function as similar error correcting codes. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> puncture P is interposed between the parallel/serial converter P/S on the downstream side of systematic convolutional encoder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and interleaver <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to thin out part of the bit sequence, to thereby improve the coding efficiency of the outer code encoder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Also in the decoding process of serially concatenated convolutional codes, soft-input soft-output decoders are used to successively decode two kinds of systematic convolutional codes in a similar manner to the way the turbo codes are decoded as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, so as to able to reduce errors by performing iterative decoding using the likelihood information of the previously decoded result. Here, the systematic convolutional encoder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the outer-code encoder (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) and the systematic convolutional encoder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the inner-code encoder may be configured of other systematic convolutional encoders. For the detail of the SCCC, reference should be made to Sergio Benedetto et al. &ldquo;Serial Concatenation of Interleaved Codes: Performance Analysis, Design, and Iterative Decoding&rdquo;, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol.44, No.5 May 1998. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Here, since the replica signals are not always correct, some error (the term e(t)) may arise if this is so. This error will be generated by decision errors of the demodulated data and/or estimation errors of &tgr;<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>. Since use of the data judged from the signal having undergone interference cancellation improves the accuracy of the replicas, it can be expected that multiple numbers of canceling will be able to reduce the error ratio of the wanted signal step by step. This scheme is called subtract type multi-stage canceller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the conventional schemes, the decoding process of error correcting codes and the interference cancellation are performed separately. Therefore, if interference cancellation is imperfect, this is regarded as noise which is impossible to be removed, causing deterioration of error correcting capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further, since complex decoding is needed when error correcting codes such as convolutional codes are used, it is considered that it is difficult to combine multi-stage interference cancellation with the decoding process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention have been devised by paying attention to the fact that iterative decoding of parallel or serial concatenated convolutional codes, such as turbo codes, SCCC and the like, outputs provisional decoded results and likelihood information in the course of the decoding process and effective use of these makes it possible to implement interference cancellation without marked increase in the amount of operations for decoding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> That is, both interference cancellation and iterative decoding of turbo codes, SCCC or the like are enabled to be performed simultaneously by decoding a plurality of turbo codes, SCCC or the like which interfere with one another, in parallel and block-wise, performing iterative decoding, making use of the decoded data and likelihood information obtained as the transitive decoding result of turbo codes, SCCC or the like, to decode other blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the first embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a parallel concatenated convolutional coder (PCCC: turbo encoder) wherein a systematic (recursive) convolutional (RSC) encoders <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are arranged in parallel with an interleaver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Interleaver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rearranges an input data sequence X so as to create a data sequence XI which is composed of the same elements but arranged in a different order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The data sequence (parity data) obtained by recursively convoluting an input data sequence X through RSC encoder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assumed as Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while the data sequence (parity data) obtained by recursively convoluting the data sequence XI, which was rearranged by interleaver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, through encoder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is assumed as Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In other words, the first parity code sequence Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second parity code sequence Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are generated from input data sequence X, so the encoder produces parallel outputs (X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Upon transmission, the input data sequence X, first code sequence Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second code sequence Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are passed through a parallel/serial converter P/S and the processed result is spectrum despread through a spreader <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that the signal is send out as a spread code sequence (X&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a basic structure of a turbo decoder of a received signal r(t) which is comprised of transmitted signals from a plurality of transmitting stations. Here, for description convenience, illustration is given showing a case where three users are making code division multiple access on the same frequency. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one cycle of decoding is called one stage, and the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> among iterative decoding are shown. Here, since decoding of an identical scheme is implemented in parallel for every user, the turbo-code decoder for one user will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the initial stage of the turbo decoding process, or the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is comprised of a despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, turbo-code decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, turbo-code re-encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, all being arranged in series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> despreads the input received signal sequence (X&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) using respective spreading codes. In this process, some interference component may remain in each signal depending on the strength of cross-correlation. The despread received signal sequences (X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are made to pass through serial/parallel converter S/P (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and are supplied separately to turbo-code decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In turbo-code decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a single cycle of decoding process is performed first. This operation of decoding is the same as the conventional decoding process of turbo codes and will be described with reference to the block diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Turbo-code encoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is generally comprised of soft-decision decoders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, interleavers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a deinterleaver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a decoding judgment portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The thus configured parallel concatenated convolutional code (turbo code) decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives the received signal sequences (X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the likelihood information E determined by the previous decoding process of the signal.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The data sequence X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) obtained as the decoded result of the above one cycle of decoding is input to encoder (turbo encoder) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for producing a replica signal of the transmitted signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> so that it is once again encoded into turbo codes, which is further spread again at a re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by spreading codes to generate a replica signal RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the transmitted signal. The replica signals of users <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are designated by RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In order to create replicas of the signals from other users sent out from other base stations, three series of blocks from the despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided in parallel for individual users to configure the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is implemented by an iterative process of the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the received signal r(t) is passed through a delay circuit (Delay) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the process of the second stage is implemented with a delay of a predetermined time lag relative to the first stage. In the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for subtracting replica signals RX of other users (the second and third users) from the input data sequence X&prime; of the received signal is provided prior to despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in addition to the configuration of the first stage. In the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, replica signals RX of other users to be subtracted are null, so that they are not depicted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, first in subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, replica signals (RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;RX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) for other users (the second and third users) obtained from the previous stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are subtracted from the received signal r(t) (cancellation of interference components) so as to produce new received sequences (input data sequence X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, the first code sequence Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the second code sequence Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;). Here, cancellation of the interference components can be implemented correctly by subtracting the replicas (RX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;RX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the interference components, which have been generated from the replica signals by taking into account the influences of the gains of the communication paths, phase rotations, and other factors, as the signal of the bandwidth of the signal spread from the received signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The above received sequences (X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) are despread by despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and supplied to turbo decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At this point, the first user likelihood information E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; which was generated at the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as extrinsic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The process after turbo decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and downwards includes the same processes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, where a replica signal RX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Thus, by repeating the process similar to the way that data decoding and generation of replica signals are implemented in the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in a usual, iterative manner of decoding for turbo codes, it is possible to cancel the interference components as well as to decode turbo codes as error correcting codes, with a simple configuration. That is, the turbo-code decoder of the present embodiment is featured by provision of the function of generating replica signals RX from interfering stations and removing them from the received signal, so that the complexity of decoding will not increase compared to the conventional turbo decoders (through the repeated number should be increased in order to obtain improved characteristics). Further, when the turbo decoding process is substituted by a simple hard-decision process, this results in a similar configuration to the conventional subtraction type multi-stage interference canceller, thus enabling a simple configuration to perform both cancellation of interference components and decoding of turbo codes as error correcting codes, simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> (The Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Here, the same components as in the above embodiment are allotted with the same reference numerals and the description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the above first embodiment, the turbo decoding process at decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at each stage ST is performed once for every stage and then the operation goes to the subsequent stage ST. In this case, when replica signal RX is produced, the precision of generation of the replica signal may become lowered if the decoded data includes many errors, possibly leading to an increase in errors. To avoid this, in the present embodiment, errors of the decoded data are reduced by performing a predetermined number of feedback loops in the turbo decoding process at each stage so as to enhance the accuracy in producing replica signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a process scheme in the present invention. The difference from the arrangement of the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is in that a plurality of loops are repeated for decoding turbo codes at each decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> before replica signal RX is produced at the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. More specifically, iterative turbo decoding process is performed by using the likelihood information E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; from deinterleaver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) as the input likelihood information E to the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After reduction of decoded data errors by the above process, replica signal RX is produced, and this is followed by the interference cancellation process at the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Of course, the iterative number of turbo-code decoding process at each stage ST can be set arbitrarily. For example, it is possible to vary the number of loops such that there are six loops at the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and one loop only at the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Thus, the above process enables effective implementation of interference cancellation by reducing errors of decoded data X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) hence enhancing the accuracy of the replica signals RXn when replica signals RXn are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> (The Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, the third embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Here, the same configurations as in the above embodiments are allotted with the same reference numerals and the description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the system configuration of the present embodiment. The difference from the configuration of the first embodiment resides in that decoders <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>output likelihood values LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LY<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of parity data Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and a weighting portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of each turbo encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Weighting portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a means which is disposed downstream of turbo encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and estimates the accuracy of the replica signal based on the likelihood information LLR (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) obtained from the decoding process of turbo codes at decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and performs a weighting process on the replica signal. The error corrected data X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having been weighted by weighting portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is spread by re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to produce a weighted replica signal URX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the above embodiment, the weighted replica signals URX<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to URX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, produced at the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for different users are supplied appropriately to subtracting portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of each user at the next stage, or second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so as to implement subtraction of the sum of the weighted replica signals of the other users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In order to be able to output the likelihood values of parity data Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a likelihood information synthesizer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in addition to the configuration of the above-described decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Likelihood information synthesizer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> receives as its input the parity symbol LY<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with likelihood information determined by soft-decision decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the parity symbol LY<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with likelihood information determined by soft-decision decoder <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and decoded symbol LX&prime; with likelihood information output from deinterleaver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and outputs as likelihood information of a code sequence the likelihood information of the decoded symbol and parity symbols en bloc to weighting portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The likelihood values of parity symbols Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) can be obtained by the above equation (6) similarly to the likelihood value of the aforementioned information symbol (the information symbol u<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is assumed to be the parity symbol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The weighted replica signal is given by the following equation (9):</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>&equals;tan<highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>))&middot;&dgr;(sign(<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>),<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>&prime;),</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> where x is substituted by uk. &dgr;(a,b) is a function which is equal to 1 when a&equals;b only and is equal to 0 otherwise. x&prime; indicates a symbol obtained by re-encoding. Sign(x) is a function which is equal to 1 when x is positive and is equal to &minus;1 when x is negative. That is, the weight is set at the tanh of the likelihood information LLR when the sign of the re-encoded symbol coincides with that of the symbol obtained from the likelihood information LLR, and set at 0 otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows error ratio characteristics of the present embodiment. Turbo-codes have a constraint length of 3 and a block length of 1000. The number of iterative decoding is assumed to be 18. The modulations for both the information modulation and spread modulation are implemented by the BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying). The spreading ratio is 4 and as to the spreading codes, the maximal-length sequence having a period of (2<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>&minus;1) is truncated based on the frame length. It is assumed that the communication path is static and the wanted station and interfering stations present the same received signal level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> comparatively shows the characteristics of the cases where the number of users varies from one to five under the above conditions. The single user case is free from interference and is assumed to present the ideal characteristics. In contrast, as the number of users increases, degradation of the characteristic occurs due to interference. However, the decoding operation with the interference canceling (IC) function of the present embodiment turned out to markedly improve the characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As described heretofore, each code block is subjected in parallel or in series with others to the process comprising the steps of producing replicas of the transmitted signals by weighting the aforementioned error corrected signal X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) in accordance with the ratio of the interference with the wanted component of the received signal, using the likelihood information and subtracting the replicas from the received signal (to remove interference components). This cycle is repeated over a plurality of stages to thereby complete the decoding process, whereby it is possible to obtain high-accuracy decoded result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (The Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the block diagram showing a system configuration of the present embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Here, the same components as in the above embodiments are allotted with the same reference numerals and the description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In each stage in the first through third embodiments, a spread received signal r(t) is received while the spread replica signals RX generated for individual user in the previous stage are subtracted. In this embodiment, received signal sequences r<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (X&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;) are reverse spread in the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and they are supplied as the input signals to the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and downwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Therefore, no despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as above is provided for the second stage and downwards. Since the input signals to the second stage and downwards are not spread signals, the replica signals of the transmitted signals produced at each stage do not need to be spread so no re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, at subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or downwards, the sum of the non-spread replica signals of the others is subtracted from the despread received signal sequences (X, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). In this case, each replica signal is multiplied (weighted) by a cross-correlational value (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>i,j</subscript></highlight>) between associated spread codes to implement the subtraction. Specifically, for the reception of the first user, the second user replica signal URX<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> multiplied by cross-correlational value (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>1,2</subscript></highlight>) and the third user replica signal URX<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> multiplied by cross-correlational value (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>1,3</subscript></highlight>) are subtracted from the despread received signal sequence X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Thus, interference cancellation through subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is implemented by weighting taking into account the influences of the gains, phase rotations of the communication paths and the cross-correlation between the spread codes and further weighting based on the obtained likelihood information and subtracting the result in units of the symbols after despreading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Also in this case, a highly-accurate decoded result equivalent to the above embodiments could be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (The Fifth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a system configuration of this embodiment, wherein a circuit configuration when transmitting stations implement multi-code transmission of information sequences using a plurality of spread codes orthogonal to each other. Here, the same components as in the above embodiment are allotted with the same reference numerals so that the description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The difference of this embodiment from the configuration of the third embodiment is that in order to deal with multi-code transmission using a plurality of spread codes orthogonal to each other, a pair of despreaders <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are provided in parallel while a delay circuit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is disposed prior to one of the spreaders <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and an MRC circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for implementing Rake synthesis is provided on the downstream side of the pair of despreaders <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, an adder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for summing replica signals (restored symbols) at the same stage is provided and a subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for subtracting the sum of the replica signals RX in adder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided prior to each of despreaders <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the second stage and downwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A plurality of electric waves or transmitted signals undergo different delays depending on the communication paths and are received together by the receiver. In multi-code transmission using orthogonal spread codes, no interference occurs between signals free from any delay, but signals having delays therebetween will interfere with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> At the first stage ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the received signal undergoing other station&apos;s interference arising in the code division multiple access (CDMA) system is reverse spread through each despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> based on the associated spreading code and the result is subjected to the Rake synthesis. Thereafter the signal is decoded (once) by turbo coding. The decoded information sequence is again turbo-coded by turbo encoder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and the resultant signal is weighted by weighting portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> using likelihood information LLR (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) in the same way as in the third embodiment. This is re-spread by re-spreader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The thus obtained re-spread signals are synthesized by adder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to produce a replica signal RX of the transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> At the second stage ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the replica signal RX of the transmitted signal is subtracted from the received signal in subtracter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the timing of the delayed wave so as to extract the leading wave component, which is reverse spread by despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the same manner, the leading wave is removed so as to extract the delayed wave, which is reverse spread by despreader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The thus despread received signals are subjected to maximum ratio composition at MRC circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, whereby signal components corresponding to respective spreading codes can be extracted. From here and thereafter, the decoding process after decoder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is repeatedly performed using likelihood information E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the prior stage, in the same manner as in the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Though the above description of the present embodiment was made of removal of interference components and decoding of error correcting codes when using turbo codes, it is also possible to obtain the same effects as in the case where a serial concatenated convolutional coding (SCCC) is used.
