<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to color filters and liquid crystal display devices using the color filters, and particularly relate to a liquid crystal display device capable of reproducing a wide range of colors. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal display devices (LCDs) are used for various apparatuses, such as notebook PCs, personal digital assistants, and digital cameras, which take advantage of the light weight, small thickness, reduced power consumption, and the like of the liquid crystal display devices. The display properties (luminance, color reproducibility, viewing angle characteristics, and the like) of the liquid crystal display devices have been much improved, and therefore, use of the liquid crystal display devices is spreading to desktop monitors in addition to conventional notebook PCs. In addition, by improving the color reproducibility of desktop LCD monitors, liquid crystal television sets having a big screen are being developed in these days. In general, however, improving the color reproducibility leads to a reduced transmittance of the color filter. Accordingly, a color filter having a high transmittance is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While the liquid crystal display devices for desktop monitors require a color reproducibility of 50 to 65% in NTSC (National Television System Committee) ratio, liquid crystal television sets require a wider range of color reproducibility of 60 to 75% in NTSC. In addition to a wider range of color reproducibility, it is desired that, in the liquid crystal television set, each of the red, green, and blue colors has the same tone as that of conventional CRT television sets. The color properties of the conventional CRT television sets are substantially the same as in the EBU (European Broadcasting Union) standards in which the chromaticity coordinates of red, green, and blue in the XYZ colorimetric system are set at (0.640, 0.330), (0.290, 0.600), and (0.150, 0.060), respectively. Also, the color temperature of the white color displayed by a conventional CRT television set is set at about 9000 to 10000 K. This temperature is higher than the color temperature of the white color displayed by a liquid crystal display device for desktop monitors, which is set at 6000 to 7500 K. The liquid crystal television sets also need a high color temperature of the white color displayed by them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal display devices, usually, display color images using a backlight source and a color filter in combination. Such a conventional combination of a backlight source and a color filter, however, does not lead to a color reproducibility, color tone, and a white color temperature satisfying the requirements for liquid crystal television sets. Specifically, the combination brings about problems in that (1) a small range of colors can be reproduced; (2) color tones in pixels is far away from the EBU standards; (3) the color temperature of the white color displayed thereby is low; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a backlight source having a high color temperature (about 10000 K) is used for a liquid crystal display device in combination with the conventional color filter in order to increase the color temperature of the white color displayed thereby, the color tone takes on a blue tinge and thus fades. In particular, the red tone shifts to blue excessively in comparison with when a light source for desktop monitors is used. For example, when a backlight source having a high color temperature is used in combination with a color filter for desktop monitors, the red chromaticity, particularly the x value, is reduced to 0.590 to 0.615, and the red chromaticity is far from the EBU standard of (0.640, 0.330), which means the standard television color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to prepare a color filter satisfying the EBU standards using a conventional backlight source for desktop monitors, it is required to increase the thickness of blue dots and the concentration of pigments and to improve the color purity. In this instance, unfortunately, the transmittance of the blue dots is greatly reduced. Consequently, the white color takes on a yellow tinge and thus the display characteristics deteriorate. Also, the white color temperature is low and thus the requirements for liquid crystal television sets are not satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition to the reduction of the transmittance, problems are caused in workability of the color filter and the shape of the dots. For example, when the thickness of the dots is increased to improve the color reproducibility but the concentration of pigments is not changed, the difference in height between the blue dots and the other dots is increased. This difference causes poor alignment of liquid crystal molecules and thus degrades the display quality. Also, even when the concentration of pigments is increased and the thickness of dots is reduced to improve the color reproducibility, workability is degraded and, for example, the dots are liable to crack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Considering characteristics, such as transmittance, contrast, and chromaticity, pigments for the blue dots are selected from blue and violet colors, depending on the application. Exemplary pigments for the blue dots include Pigment Blue PB-6, PB-15 (15:1, 15:2, 15:3, 15:4, 15:6), PB-21, PB-22, PB-28, PB-60, and PB-64 and Pigment Violet PV-14, PV-19, PV-23, PV-29, PV-32, PV-33, PV-36, PV-37, PV-38, PV-40, and PV-50. In practice, some pigments having excellent characteristics are selected from these pigments. Blue pigments particularly with a phthalocyanine skeleton have excellent light stability and heat resistance, and therefore, they are suitable for use in color filters. When adjustment of the chromaticity is required, dioxazine violet is added to a blue pigment having a phthalocyanine skeleton. However, it is know that the transmittance is reduced in this instance (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 9-95638 and 9-197663). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional combination of the back light and the color filter does not satisfy all the color characteristics (color reproducibility, color tone, and color temperature of the white color displayed), which are the requirements for liquid crystal display devices capable of reproducing a wide range of colors, and particularly for liquid crystal television sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, preparing a color filter having an excellent color reproducibility using a conventional blue paste causes problems such as transmittance shortage and poor alignment of liquid crystal molecules, and therefore a liquid crystal display device capable of providing high-quality images has not yet been achieved. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a thin layer such as ITO is disposed on a color filter of the present invention, the chromaticity coordinates of the color filter are measured using glass having the thin layer thereon as a reference in order to eliminate the change in color tones arising from interference by the thin layer. When a thin layer such as ITO is not formed on the color filter, the chromaticity coordinates of the color filter are measured using glass as a reference. When glass having a thin layer thereon is used as a reference, the thin layer must be formed under the same conditions as in the thin layer formed on the color filter. The chromaticity coordinates of the color filter of the present invention may be measured by an immersion method using a liquid having substantially the same refractive index as the liquid crystal in order to eliminate the change in color tones arising from interference by the thin layer, such as ITO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The color filter of the present invention has at least three color dots, red, green, and blue, and is used in combination with a three-wavelength fluorescent light source. The color filter is formed on, but not limited to, a transparent substrate such as glass and a polymer film, and it may be formed on a substrate having switching devices. The color filter is patterned in a stripe manner, a delta arrangement, or the like; however, it is not limited to this. A fixed columnar spacer may be disposed on the color filter, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pixels are formed by photolithography, printing, or electrodeposition. Considering pattern formability, it is preferable to use photolithography. Exemplary resins forming the pixels include various kinds of resins, such as acrylic resins, alkyd resins, melamine resins, polyvinyl alcohol, phenolic resins, polyamides, polyamide-imides, and polyimides, irrespective of photosensitivity. In particular, preferably, resins soluble in alkaline solution are used because they allow simple equipment for developing or etching processes. Preferably, resins having a carboxyl group are used as an alkali-soluble resin, and specifically an acrylic resin and polyimide are used in view of solvent resistance. Polyimide is more preferable because precursors of polyimide serve as a dispersing agent for pigments. Also, polyimide is preferable in view of the thermal resistance of the color filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> General coloring materials may be used as the pigments in the present invention whether they are organic pigments, inorganic pigments, or dyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is important that the color filter of the present invention includes blue dots whose chromaticity coordinates (z, Z) in the XYZ calorimetric system, measured with the C light source, satisfy the relationships 114&gt;Z&gt;&minus;1087023z<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&plus;3205105z<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&minus;3545958z<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;1744329z &minus;321773 and 0.730&lE;z&lE;0.810. When the above-described expressions are not satisfied, the transmittance of the blue dots decreases, and thus they do not exhibit excellent display characteristics. Preferably, the chromaticity coordinates (z, Z) of the blue dots satisfy the relationships 114&gt;Z&gt;&minus;1087023z<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&plus;3205105z<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&minus;3545958Z<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;1744329z &minus;321773, and 0.730&lE;z&lE;0.810, and more preferably, 114&gt;Z&gt;&minus;1361051z<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&plus;4044634Z<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&minus;4508657z<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;2234150z &minus;415091.5, and 0.735&lE;z&lE;0.81. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Z is a parameter representing the transmittance of blue light and is preferably high, but is limited to 114. In contrast, when Z is less than the value defined by the above-described expressions, the transmittance of blue light is substantially the same as in the case of using the conventional color filters; hence it does not satisfy the requirements for liquid crystal television sets. Also, when z is out of the above ranges, excellent color reproducibility is not exhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of the blue dots, measured with CIE standard light source C, satisfy the relationships 0.13&lE;x&lE;0.15 and 0.08&lE;y&lE;0.12, preferably, 0.135&lE;x&lE;0.145 and 0.085&lE;y&lE;0.115, and more preferably, 0.136&lE;x&lE;0.142 and 0.085&lE;y&lE;0.11. When x and y of the blue dots are out of the ranges described above, a blue color in accordance with the EBU standards, which define standard colors for television sets, cannot be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In red dots, preferably, the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) measured with CIE standard light source C satisfy the relationships 0.635&lE;x&lE;0.665 and 0.31&lE;y&lE;0.35. More preferably, the chromaticity coordinates satisfy the relationships 0.635&lE;x&lE;0.665 and 0.32&lE;y&lE;0.34, yet more preferably, 0.64&lE;x&lE;0.66 and 0.32&lE;y&lE;0.34, and yet still more preferably, 0.645&lE;x&lE;0.66 and 0.32&lE;y&lE;0.34. It is not preferable that x of the red dots measured with CIE standard light source C is smaller than 0.635, because the red color is far from the EBU red color standard (0.640, 0.330), which defines standard colors for television sets, and thus excellent color reproducibility cannot be exhibited. Also, it is not preferable that x of the red dots is larger than 0.665, because the transmittance of the dots is reduced and thus the luminance of the liquid crystal display device is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of the green dots, measured with CIE standard light source C, satisfy the relationships 0.20&lE;x&lE;0.34 and 0.56&lE;y&lE;0.65, more preferably, 0.21&lE;x&lE;0.33 and 0.56&lE;y&lE;0.64, and still more preferably, 0.215&lE;x&lE;0.33 and 0.565&lE;y&lE;0.63. It is not preferable that y of the green dots measured with CIE standard light source C is smaller than 0.56, because the green color is far from the EBU green color standard (0.290, 0.600), which defines standard colors for television sets, and thus excellent color reproducibility cannot be exhibited. Also, it is not preferable that y of the green dots is larger than 0.65, because the transmittance of the dots is reduced and thus the luminance of the liquid crystal display device is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Preferably, all blue, red, and green dots satisfy the above-described ranges so that color characteristics satisfying the requirements for liquid crystal television sets can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain dots having the above-described color properties, at least one selected from various pigments may be used and other pigments may be added as long as the color properties are not degraded. Exemplary typical pigments include Pigment Reds PR-2, PR-3, PR-22, PR-38, PR-149, PR-166, PR-168, PR-177, PR-209, PR-224, PR-242, and PR-254; Pigment Oranges PO-5, PO-13, PO-17, PO-31, PO-36, PO-38, PO-40, PO-42, PO-43, PO-51, PO-55, PO-59, PO-61, PO-64, PO-65, and PO-71; Pigment Yellows PY-12, PY-13, PY-14, PY-17, PY-20, PY-24, PY-83, PY-86, PY-93, PY-94, PY-109, PY-110, PY-117, PY-125, PY-137, PY-138, PY-139, PY-147, PY-148, PY-150, PY-153, PY-154, PY-166, PY-173, and PY-185; Pigment Blues PB-15 (15:1, 15:2, 15:3, 15:4, 15:6), PB-21, PB-22, PB-60, and PB-64; Pigment Violets PV-19, PV-23, PV-29, PV-32, PV-33, PV-36, PV-37, PV-38, PV-40, and PV-50; and Pigment Greens 7, 10, 36, and 47. The present invention is not limited to these and various pigments may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The above-described pigments may be subjected to surface treatment, such as rosin treatment, acid group treatment, basic treatment, or pigment derivative treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> However, preferably, a combination of PB15:6 and PV23 is used for the blue dots of the present invention in view of the color properties, dispersibility, thermal resistance, and the like thereof. In this instance, preferably, the weight ratio of PB15:6 to PV23 (PB15:6/PV23) is in the range of 96/4 to 70/30 and the chromaticity coordinate z in the XYZ colorimetric system measured with CIE standard light source C satisfies 0.73&lE;z&lE;0.81. More preferably, the weight ratio (PB15:6/PV23) is in the range of 92/8 to 75/25 and z satisfies 0.735&lE;z&lE;0.81. Still more preferably, the weight ratio (PB15:6/PV23) is in the range of 90/10 to 80/20 and z satisfies 0.745&lE;z&lE;0.81 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The combination of PB15:6 and PV23 has not been considered useful in practice because it is known that mixing PB15:6 with PV23 degrades the transmittance. The inventors, however, found that when the two are mixed with each other at a specific weight ratio within the above-described ranges and z of the resulting dots of the color filter is set in the specific ranges described above, the dots exhibit a relatively high transmittance, contrary to the conventional knowledge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For the red dots of the color filter of the present invention, preferably, a combination of pigments selected from PR177, PR254, PY138, and PY150 is used in view of the color properties, dispersibility, thermal resistance, and the like thereof. In particular, a combination of PR177 with PR254 is more preferable because it leads to a reduced thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When PR177, PR254, and PY138 are mixed with one another or PR177, PR254, and PY150 are mixed with one another, preferably, the proportions of PR177, PR254, and PY138 or PY150 to the total weight of the pigments are 15 to 50%, 30 to 60%, and 10 to 30%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When PR177 and PR254 are mixed with each other, preferably, the proportions of PR177 and PR254 are 3 to 30% and 70 to 97%, respectively. More preferably, the proportions of PR177 and PR254 are 10 to 20% and 80 to 90%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For the green dots of the color filter of the present invention, preferably, a combination of pigments selected from PG36, PY138, and PY150 is used in view of the color properties, dispersibility, thermal resistance, and the like thereof. In particular, a combination of PG36 with PY138 is more preferable because it can increase the transmittance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When PG36 and PY138 are mixed with each other or PG36 and PY150 are mixed with each other, preferably, the proportions of PG36 and PY138 or PY150 to the total weight of the pigments are 30 to 90% and 10 to 70%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, it is important to combine a color filter having the blue dots whose chromaticity coordinates (x, y) in the XYZ colorimetric system satisfy the expressions 0.13&lE;x&lE;0.15 and 0.08&lE;y&lE;0.12 and a backlight source whose chromaticity coordinates (x, y) in the XYZ colorimetric system satisfy the expressions 0.265&lE;x&lE;0.29 and 0.24&lE;y&lE;0.30. Thus, excellent color reproducibility and a white color temperature necessary for liquid television sets (9000 to 11000 K) were achieved for the first time. When the backlight source of the present invention is combined with a conventional color filter to prepare a liquid crystal display device, the entire color takes on a blue tinge and thus the color tone deteriorates. Also, when the color filter of the present invention is combined with a conventional backlight source for desktop monitors, the white color of images takes on a yellow tinge and the white color temperature is reduced; hence the requirements for liquid crystal television sets cannot be satisfied. Preferably, the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of the backlight source satisfy the expressions 0.265&lE;x&lE;0.29 and 0.24&lE;y&lE;0.30, more preferably, 0.27&lE;x&lE;0.29 and 0.245&lE;y&lE;0.295, and still more preferably, 0.275&lE;x&lE;0.285 and 0.25&lE;y&lE;0.29. More preferably, the characteristics of the color filter and others satisfy the properties described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, an exemplary method for manufacturing the color filter of the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A color paste containing at least a polyimide precursor, an organic pigment, and a solvent is applied to the surface of a transparent substrate and is then dried by air, heat, or vacuum. Thus, a colored polyimide precursor film is formed. In the case of drying by heat, preferably, the drying is performed at a temperature in the range of 50 to 180&deg; C. for 1 to 3 hours using an oven or a hotplate. Next, the resulting colored polyimide precursor film is patterned by regular wet etching. First, a positive photoresist is applied to the surface of the colored polyimide precursor film to form a photoresist layer. Subsequently, a mask is disposed above the photoresist layer and is then exposed to ultraviolet light with an exposure apparatus. After exposure, the photoresist layer and the colored polyimide precursor film are simultaneously subjected to etching with an alkaline developer for positive photoresist. After etching, an unnecessary photoresist layer is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The colored polyimide precursor film is heated to be changed into a colored polyimide film. This heat treatment, normally, is performed in the air, a nitrogen atmosphere, or vacuum for 0.5 to 5 hours, in succession or in stages, at a temperature of 150 to 450&deg; C., and preferably at a temperature of 180 to 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> These steps are performed on pastes of three colors, red, green, and blue and, if necessary, on a black-colored paste to complete the color filter for the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Next, the liquid crystal display device using the color filter will be described. The color filter is provided with, if necessary, a transparent protective layer thereon and a transparent electrode, such as ITO, on the protective layer. Subsequently, a liquid crystal-alignment layer subjected to rubbing, which is performed to align liquid crystal molecules, is disposed on the transparent electrode. Next, this color filter substrate and a transparent electrode substrate which is formed by disposing a transparent electrode, such as ITO film, on a transparent substrate are bonded so as to opposing each other and have spacers for maintaining a cell gap therebetween. The transparent electrode substrate may have a thin-film transistor (TFT) element, a thin-film diode (TFD) element, a scanning line, a signal line, and the like in addition to the transparent electrode in order to prepare a TFT liquid crystal display device or a TFD liquid crystal display device. Next, liquid crystal is injected from an inlet provided in a sealing portion, and then the inlet is sealed. Next, after a polarizer is bonded to the external surface of the substrate, an IC driver is mounted, thus completing the liquid display device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The transmittance and the chromaticity coordinates are measured with a microspectrophotometer &ldquo;MCPD-2000&rdquo; produce by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. Each chromaticity coordinate is a value measured at 2-degree field of observation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The thickness of dots is measured with a surface texture and contour measuring instrument &ldquo;SURFCOM&rdquo; 1500A produced by Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd. </paragraph>

Using an ultraviolet exposure apparatus PLA-501F produced by Canon Inc., light exposure with an ultraviolet light having an intensity of 60 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and a wavelength of 365 nm was performed through a chrome photomask. After exposure, the sample was immersed in a developer of 2.25% solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide so that the photoresist and the black coating film were simultaneously subjected to etching. After etching, an unnecessary photoresist layer was removed with acetone. The black coating film was heated at 240&deg; C. for 30 minutes so that the polyimide precursor was converted into polyimide. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> According to the observation of the resulting color filters with a microscope, a very small amount of cracks was found in the dots of the color filters of Comparative Examples 1 to 3, particularly in Comparative Example 3. In contrast, Examples 1 to 9 did not have any cracks and exhibited excellent dot-shape characteristics. According to the comparison of the dot thicknesses at the same z value, the thicknesses of the dots of Examples 1 to 9 are smaller than those of Comparative Examples 1 to 3. Also, the liquid crystal display devices having any color filter of Examples 1 to 9 caused no or little display failure and exhibited excellent characteristics. In contrast, the liquid crystal display devices having any color filter of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 exhibited disclination and, in particular, the quality of displayed images in Comparative Example 3 was reduced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 10 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A blue pigment-dispersed solution (BJD-2) of 5% was prepared as in Examples 1 to 3 except than the mixture ratio of Pigment Blue PB15:6 to Pigment Violet PV23 was changed to 88/12. As in Examples 1 to 3, a red pigment-dispersed solution (RJD-2) of 5% containing PR254 and PR177 in a ratio of 90/10 and a green pigment-dispersed solution (GJD-2) containing PG36 and PY138 in a ratio of 55/45 were prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A solution prepared by diluting 5.6 g of the polymer solution (PAA-1) with 38.4 g of &ggr;-butyrolactone was added to 56.0 g of the red pigment-dispersed solution (RJD-2) to obtain a red-colored paste RJP-2. A solution prepared by diluting 1.1 g of the polymer solution (PAA-1) with 31.7 g of &ggr;-butyrolactone was added to 67.0 g of the green pigment-dispersed solution (GJD-2) to obtain a green-colored paste GJP-2. A solution prepared by diluting 14.0 g of the polymer solution (PAA-1) with 51.0 g of (&ggr;-butyrolactone was added to 35.0 g of the blue pigment-dispersed solution (BJD-2) to obtain a blue-colored paste BJP-2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, a color filter was formed as in Examples 1 to 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of red, green, and blue measured with CIE standard light source C were (0.655, 0.335), (0.292, 0.593), and (0.138, 0.092), respectively. The chromaticity coordinates (z, Z) of blue were (0.770, 79.4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A substrate having TFT elements, pixel electrodes, and the like on a non-alkaline glass was prepared separately to serve as an opposing substrate. The opposing substrate and the substrate coated with color pastes (colored layer substrate) were printed with an alignment layer and were subjected to rubbing to align the liquid crystal molecules. One of the two substrates was printed with a sealing agent containing micro rods. After inserting a PET film with a thickness of 5 &mgr;m, acting as a spacer, the two substrates were bonded to each other. Next, a TN liquid crystal (refractive index anisotropy &Dgr;n &tilde;0.1) capable of being saturated at 4 V was injected and a liquid crystal inlet was sealed with a sealing agent. The liquid crystal cell filled with the liquid crystal was disposed between polarizing films with perpendicular polarizing axes to prepare a test liquid crystal cell. The liquid crystal cell was provided with an IC driver or the like, and thus, a liquid crystal display device was completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A three-wavelength fluorescent lamp whose chromaticity coordinates (x, y) in the XYZ colorimetric system were (0.280, 0.270) was placed under the prepared liquid crystal cell, and the chromaticity coordinates were measured. The image was colorful and red, green and blue colors had chromaticity coordinates of (0.642, 0.330), (0.292, 0.598), and (0.148, 0.061), respectively, which are equivalent to the EBU standards. Also, the liquid crystal display device having the color filter exhibited a bluish white tone and excellent color balance. The color temperature of the white color displayed thereby was 9800 K and the color properties satisfied the requirements for liquid crystal television sets. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A test liquid crystal cell was prepared as in Example 10 except that the red pigment ratio of PR254 to PY150 was changed to 90/10 and that 100% of PB15:6 was used as a blue pigment. The chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of red, green, and blue measured with CIE standard light source C were (0.630, 0.335), (0.298, 0.593), and (0.138, 0.125), respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A three-wavelength fluorescent lamp whose chromaticity coordinates (x, y) in the XYZ calorimetric system were (0.280, 0.270) was placed under the prepared liquid crystal cell, and the chromaticity coordinates were measured. The image was not colorful and red, green and blue colors had chromaticity coordinates of (0.612, 0.337), (0.294, 0.605), and (0.147, 0.085), respectively, which are far from the EBU standards. </paragraph>
