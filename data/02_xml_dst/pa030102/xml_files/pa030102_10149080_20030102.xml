<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A telecommunications interface <highlight><bold>12 </bold></highlight>is connected between a voice network <highlight><bold>10 </bold></highlight>(for example the PSTN) and a data network <highlight><bold>11 </bold></highlight>(for example the Internet). Calls from a caller <highlight><bold>14 </bold></highlight>for a recipient <highlight><bold>18 </bold></highlight>are directed to the gateway which accesses user information from a profile <highlight><bold>15 </bold></highlight>to determine how the call is to be routed. The user profile is generated by reference to an appointment calendar <highlight><bold>16 </bold></highlight>(for example Microsoft Outlook), and/or by reference to an organisational hierarchy. Rules based diversion is also provided so that certain calls originating from pre-specified callers (identified by network Calling Line Identification signals) are handled in a more specific manner than calls to the default destination. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a telecommunications interface and more particularly, but not exclusively, to an interface between a connection oriented network and a connectionless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There have been a number of arrangements proposed to enable completion of calls to a designated telephone number when the person being called is not at that telephone number. So-called personal numbers usually allow the customer to select a fixed network telephone number and a mobile (cellular) network telephone number to which calls may be diverted. Such arrangements require either that the customer contacts a service provider&apos;s system to notify which number to try preferentially or for the numbers to be tried in turn. In other arrangements calls to a particular telephone number may be diverted on the basis of a Day of Week/Time of Day fixed program. One such arrangement is disclosed in European Patent Specification No. 0954193. In all of these cases some deliberate notification activity to the network service provider is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a telecommunications interface in a communications network, the interface comprising means responsive to each call to one of a plurality of users of the network to access user provided profile data at a node of the network, said profile data relating to the respective user and to determine from said profile data and from data defining identity of a calling party in a current call a preferred destination for the current call in either the originating network or in an alternative network characterised in that the user profile data is derived from a schedule or electronic diary to determine from location data entered by the user a preferred destination for the current call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Preferably the interface is located between a connection oriented and a connectionless network and uses profile data from the connectionless network to determine the preferred destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The preferred destination may be in the connection oriented or in the connectionless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The data defining the calling party may be calling line identification (CLI) data originating in the connection oriented network and the profile data may include data defining a preferred destination for each of a plurality of specified CLIs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Each of said plurality of CLI&apos;s may have respective data defining time related destination identities or there may be a single profile for a plurality of specified CLI&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably also the user profile data includes data defining a preferred destination for any call originating other than from a specified CLI or CLIs which data may be time oriented and/or call type oriented. The User profile data may refer to a schedule or electronic diary to determine from location data entered by the user a preferred destination for the current call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The interface may include means responsive to user profile data to transmit to a user telephone appointment or alarm information either directly to a user telephone using interactive voice messaging or by transmitting a data message to the user telephone or to a pager or other destination specified by the user profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a telecommunications routing agent responsive to calls directed to a communications user&apos;s address to determine, from data derived from the respective communications user&apos;s personal electronic schedule and a respective personal profile script, a routing within at least one telecommunications or data network for each such call, said routing being further dependent upon the identity of a calling party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The telecommunications network may be a connection oriented or connectionless network and is preferably a connection oriented network such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The data network may be a connectionless network such as an Internet or intranet, the users personal profile data and/or personal electronic schedule being retained in the connectionless network.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> so-called intelligent telecommunications network comprises a number of telephone exchanges or service switching points (only two of which are shown for simplicity) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The service switching points are interconnected to provide connections between customer lines <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are connected to customer premises to provide telephony service for example. Each of the customer lines <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a fixed node of the network which is connectable to any other fixed node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the network, each such node being identified by a telephone number which is transmitted by a calling customer to a service switching point <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Within a service switching point <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> processor control (not shown) software programs examine numbers signalled by calling customers to determine if the call connection is within the capability of the service switching point or whether further intelligence is required to effect &ldquo;number translation&rdquo;. If further intelligence is required (for example because of the particular code dialled indicates a special call type) then the Service switching point may transmit a message to a service control point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the message including data defining the origin of the call and the signalled telephone number. The service control point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> determines how the call should be handled and returns a message to the service switching point instructing how the call is to be further connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The further connection may be to a service platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for providing special facilities such as an answering service for example or to a so-called intelligent peripheral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which may provide prompt and collect facilities for example to transmit a voice message to the calling customer and to collect responses from the customer to provide further information on the continued re-direction of the call. In any event, there is always an individual connection from the calling customers telephone through the network to the destination whether by individual physical link, for example a copper wire, or by virtue of an allocated digital channel. Thus this type of network is referred to as connection oriented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Recent developments in data networks have led to such as the so-called &ldquo;world wide web&rdquo; or internet and also to intra-nets which interconnect desk top computers, servers and the like. These networks tend to operate by transmitting data messages having a header which defines a destination address and an originating address for example. There is no dedicated path between the originating device and the destination device, the header being used to direct data messages across a shared network until it reaches the addressed port. Thus it is possible for consecutive messages from one computer process to another computer process to take different routes through the network. The kind of data messaging network uses defined signalling protocols for example Internet Protocol (IP) currently IP4 (but likely to become IP6) or other defined protocols on intra nets for example. These networks are, because there is no fixed path between any two nodes, usually referred to as connectionless networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Most connection oriented networks have interconnect points with connectionless networks such that connectionless network traffic can be transferred from the connection oriented network (on which customers may have personal computers for example) to the connectionless network and vice&mdash;versa. Data generated within a personal computer by processes running in that computer may have an individual originating/terminating address relating to each process. Thus, although a part of the communication may be on a connection oriented network the transfer of data between different processes may still be in a connectionless manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the present invention is intended to integrate a voice (connection oriented) network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an IP data (connectionless) network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a gateway (telecommunications interface) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on receiving data defining a call from a caller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the voice network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consults a user profile <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the IP data network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The user profile has access to the user&apos;s schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and organisational data <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from which can be determined the attributes to be associated with each call for the user. Thus the gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may derive from the user profile <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, users schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the calling line identity of the caller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, organisational data <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> an actual telephonic destination for the call in the voice network. The selected destination may be the called person (recipient) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by way of a mobile phone or one of a possible multiplicity of other network nodes. Alternatively the call may be routed to an answering service (for example the proprietor&apos;s network based &ldquo;call minder&rdquo; (Trademark) service <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Call diversion of specified CLI originating calls to a third party, for example a manager or secretary may also be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus the system provides flexibility of destination based upon several user inputs selected from data provided by the user for other than telephony purposes. This flexibility is enhanced since the user schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be the calendar program to which other persons may enter data such as by use of automatic meeting setting programs, secretarial arrangements or management or other schedulers. The system is not limited to consulting a single schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> if the user profile <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> indicates that multiple schedule programs are in use. The gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may thus derive an overall schedule from a plurality of schedule programs and take in to account all inputs before determining the routing of a call from caller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to recipient <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus in calendar call routing mode, incoming calls to a personal number are routed to a destination selected from the current appointment in the calendar and a user profile. This allows call routing to be performed on an appointment by appointment basis. Thus, for each appointment in the user&apos;s schedule a destination may be selected for some or all incoming calls for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The existing destination (pre notified in the user profile <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) for example the user&apos;s desk telephone, a meeting room phone or a mobile phone; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A call answering service with or without a notification being transmitted to (e.g.) a text or other pager; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Ring multiple destinations simultaneously and connect the call to the first to answer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Ring multiple destinations sequentially and connect the call to the first to answer within a pre-specified time; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Route to default rule destination; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Route to any other specified number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Rule based routing in the user profile may be used to override appointment settings, for example calls originating from calling number &ldquo;X&rdquo; (defined by CLI) should always be connected to destination &ldquo;Y&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Where there is no calendar appointment shown then incoming calls are always routed according to the rules in the user profile. Thus &ldquo;before 8 pm and after 5 pm route calls to call answering otherwise route to desktop phone&rdquo; may be included as a default rule which may be overridden by CLI based rules (as mentioned in the preceding paragraph). Where there is a calendar based appointment then telephony rules related to the appointment location are used which may again be over ruled by CLI based rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Certain CLI rules may result in multiple ring calls across several users&mdash;for example if an organisation has a number of people who may deal with a particularly important call CLI based rule in one persons user profile (or an organisational &ldquo;master&rdquo; profile) may cause a multi ring call to diverse destinations determined from more than one user profile so that the caller is quickly connected to the first available (first to answer) call recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the system to the user include the integration of telephony diversion within existing desktop applications such as the calendar function of Microsoft (trademark) Outlook or Schedule/Schedule plus type programs; a simple to use system without the need to duplicate data input, call routing being based on an existing calendar application; the incoming caller does not need to know (nor need be revealed) personal numbers such as home telephone numbers or personal mobile numbers; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In order to perform the tasks required of it, the gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> expects a user profile <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> identified by and containing a personal number to include primary contact details such as a home telephone number, a desk number, mobile number, secretary, manager, subordinates and pager number for example. Each of these may be specified in data fields allocated for those numbers which exist and the calendar or profile software will offer multiple choice destinations when the user inputs either a calendar appointment or user profile data at the desktop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Rule based routing is simple to effect using language such as </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;always&rdquo; or &ldquo;between . . . and . . . &rdquo; &ldquo;Monday to Friday&rdquo; &ldquo;Weekend&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> send calls from CLI . . . to . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> never send calls from CLI . . . to . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Send all calls before/after . . . to . . . otherwise send all calls to . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Never send calls after . . . to . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The rule based routing program includes &ldquo;sanity&rdquo; checks to ensure that the user is alerted to potential conflict between rules as they are created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be arranged to provide appointment reminders based on schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Calendar software typically provides reminders through a &ldquo;pop-up&rdquo; dialog window. The Gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be used to forward reminders to a text pager or telephone with text display or may call the user (based on current location) and use text to speech conversion to provide appointment information to the user. The gateway may also be used to enable the user (or other authorised caller) to query the users schedule <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using an inter-active voice system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may also be used to facilitate the establishment of conference calls for example by using a calendar programs ability to schedule a meeting with several users by way of electronic (e-mail) messaging. Following acceptance of a request to join a conference at a specified time the gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will automatically call all of the participants at the appropriate time. Calendar call routing as mentioned above can be used so that the call is established to each participant based on that user&apos;s location at the time of the call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Where incoming calls are unanswered the gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be able to provide helpful information to the calling party, for example (subject to user profile rules), the gateway could use calendar information to inform the users current location and the expected duration of appointments together with a message indicating the time at which the called party is expected to be available to take calls prior to connection to the answering service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Persistent callers (determined from CLI for example) or senior management calls could be diverted to &ldquo;all telephones in a selected group&rdquo;, or to the secretary or through identity of project groups or line management responsibilities in the organisational hierarchy <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, calendar call routing application may be implemented using Microsoft Outlook 98 client coupled with the Microsoft Exchange Server program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Using the Outlook forms programming environment with the Active X control function and VBScript language schematically represented at <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Call translation requests are held in an Oracle8 (Trademark) database <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The call translation application <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are built using Parlay API standards specification (currently available at http://www.parlay.org). The gateway <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located between a connection oriented network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as the Public Switched telephone Network (PSTN) a private telephone system (PBX) or a voice of IP network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If the computer/telephony integration (CTI) server <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not integral with the desktop CTI client server suite then it may be provided separately using a suitable PC server to provide an interface between the calendar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and call translation applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The desktop CTI client <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is implemented by extension of the functionality of Microsoft Outlook (currently MS Outlook 97 and 98 versions) using the MS Outlook Appointment form. Thus, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> telephony tab <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is added to the windows display of the Outlook appointment form so that the when the user completes an appointment form simply using a point and click operation the user is taking to a telephony sub window which is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to which reference is now made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the telephony window display form of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, point and click options are provided to the user to enable selection of the options to be carried out during this appointment. Thus by clicking on the &ldquo;Divert to Call Minder&rdquo; selection <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> all calls, unless from a CLI having an overriding rule in the user profile, will be diverted to the answering facility. Clicking on the &ldquo;no action&rdquo; selection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> leaves calls following the default rules from the user profile for the duration of the current appointment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> By selecting the &ldquo;divert to&rdquo; option <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the customer is offered a drop down menu <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the more recently used or most likely option showing in the selection port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The drop down selection menu will offer all options currently held in the user profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In addition to selecting telephony options for the duration of the appointment the user also has the opportunity to have a reminder message by text or text to voice. Selection of this option using port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows selection of a message destination in port <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> using a drop down menu from tab <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Again the drop down menu will include all available options from the users profile including pager, sms text to phone and text-to-voice phone messaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The transmitted message may either be directly derived from the information entered in the appointment pro-forma or may be a specific message entered for the purpose in the telephony form in port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The reminder message (if selected) is transmitted in accordance with the timing dictated in the appointment form (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) based on the selected day and start time (ports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) and the reminder request timing (port <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If a reminder request is not set in the appointment from of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> then a default time period from the user profile will be used if a reminder is requested in the telephony proforma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The settings tab <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> allows the user to update (e.g.) telephone numbers in the user profile as hereinafter referred to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the design time view of a user defined tab in Microsoft Outlook is shown. The following components can be seen although the Object Model exposed by Outlook does not show all events or functionality. (The Object Model referenced here, at the date of this patent application, may be seen at </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> http://www.microsoft.com/OutlookDev/Articles&commat;Outprog.htm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Outlook Form Controls <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> enable cross referencing of requested actions to the call translation database (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> ActiveX Controls <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> enable capture of call handling requirements, accessing of the user profile and communication with the desktop CTI Server (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> VBScript Event Handlers are used to effect the functionality of the Active X Controls and the rest of the form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The dotted area represents the background of the form display area which is inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The telephony tab contains the following controls and/or user properties used to contain state information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Callminder&rdquo; The fixed call minder (answering service) number to be used&mdash;this could 1 also be a configurable part of the user profile information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Destination&rdquo; A number to which incoming calls are to be diverted. The purpose of this field is to select the correct options on the GUI when the form is re-opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;translated&rdquo; Cross reference to the Call Translation Database </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Remind&rdquo; Number to which a reminder if any is to be sent. This is used to keep the GUI consistent with the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Reminder/Message&rdquo; reminder message to be sent if not the default message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Reminderld&rdquo; Cross reference to the messaging data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The ActiveX Control is used to implement the call translation facility. Outlook form Controls/User properties may not be satisfactory for implementation of the call translation request functionality as if another user received an invitation to a meeting for which the organiser had set telephony options the invited user also saw the originators telephony settings before the meeting was accepted. This feature could result in unwanted disclosure of telephone numbers to an invited party such that in preference Microsoft distributed COM was used to communicate with the server component so that data base entries are created for call translation requests (and for updating call translation requests) and for reminder messages. The returned keys from the COM entry are then stored in the form&apos;s User Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Where CTI is provided as an add-on facility to an existing system then TCP socket connection could be provided as an alternative communications channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The VBScript event handlers used by the present arrangement are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Item_Open( )&rdquo; Configures ActiveX control when the form is displayed; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Item_PropertyChange( )&rdquo; Appointment updates reflected in ActiveX Control </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Item_Write( )&rdquo; Activated when the form is being saved, or a modified form is being closed. Calls the public method of the ActiveX control requesting calls to be diverted, and update Form&apos;s User Defined Fields. If the form is not visible (e.g. the time of an appointment is being changed by dragging it&mdash;without opening&mdash;in the Outlook calendar) then an instance of the ActiveX object is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Item_Close( )&rdquo; Updates Outlook Form controls with database cross-references. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the user profile comprises a set of phone numbers and a default destination to which calls to the personal number are normally sent. As previously mentioned, this profile is accessed through the settings tab (<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). These settings may be stored as an Outlook Contact item and could be configured from existing contact entries. The default routing is stored in an Oracle8 database which is used by the application performing number translation for the connection oriented network. For preference in implementation however the User Profile is held with a full set of user rules as a central component on the desktop client program which would determine how incoming calls are handled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The functions of the Desktop CTI server (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) include writing call translation requests and reminder message requests from the client <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in to the database <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The desktop CTI is also the operable component for promoting call translation request to an actual call divert on call arrival and will trigger distribution of the reminder messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Prior to transmitting a reminder message or activating a diversion the CTI server checks to determine if an entered appointment still exists since the Outlook Object Model does not export an Item_Delete( ) event. Thus the CTI uses the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to check whether the User Properties match the database keys. Similarly for the duration of a live call translation function the CTI must continue to monitor the Calendar for any deletions or changes of appointment or user profile setting. If an appointment is cancelled or changed then corresponding changes are carried out in the database <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Thus referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at run time a &ldquo;delete expired reminders and diverts&rdquo; process is started (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) which retrieves pending reminder and divert requests from the database <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>). The appropriate users calendar/schedule is opened (<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>) and the appointments data and database data compared for compatibility (<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> If there is an incompatibility between the data held in the database <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the users calendar then the database entry is deleted and any corresponding special telephony request is amended (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). If the appointment data is still valid then the reminder which triggered the run time request (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) or the divert of the causal incoming telephony call is effected (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although the above specific description uses desktop CTI server and Microsoft Outlook clients there are other equally valid implementations of the invention using other calendar programs and other database and CTI information. For example, routing rules could be stored in an integrated desktop email/calendar/contacts/CTI server in which when a call arrives the user profile is opened with the user calendar and routing determined. All rules could alternatively be held in a call translation application or there may be a hybrid system having in which both a call translation application and a CTI server could each have some rules with a determination of those rules which are over riding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Although for example only the description hereinbefore assumes that the user profile data is located in a connectionless network with calls originating and terminating in a connection oriented network it will be realised that using, for example, voice over IP methods calls could also originate and/or terminate in the connectionless network. The invention provides flexible user controllable re-direction and termination of telephony calls using user resources (Calendar/Schedule programs for example) which are more specifically directed towards the customers other needs. Thus, once the user has established profile data determining basic re-direction requirements, and/or organisational defaults are provided (for example by an employing organisation) the customer need not take any further action to ensure calls are diverted to an appropriate destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Turning then to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> simple system may be provided to enable call redirection between or within networks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. A call having a destination in network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arrives at a gateway <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> which forwards a signalling message to a routing application on a virtual path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The message may include information such as Direct Dialling In destination number, the calling line identity of the caller, and other class of service type information for example. This information is used by a routing application <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which uses launches an SQL query by way of virtual path <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to a relational database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The agent simply works by consulting on virtual paths <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> (representing accesses solely internal to the database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>) to determine a destination from the database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The destination data held in the relational database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is derived from data held in a specific user profile <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;white pages&rdquo; <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, translation tables <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and rule table <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The user profile <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, individual to a user, includes the user&apos;s personal calendar or schedule <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, details of the user&apos;s contacts (e.g. an address book function), a journal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and rules <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. The rules are derived in part from the White pages information and in part from information supplied by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Thus the white pages <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> include account details, user information <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and organisational information <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which can provide default rules <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> which are added to or substituted for the personal rules at <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The account identity from <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be associated with a virtual telephony identity as shown in the look up table <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the combination of account identity and rule identity from <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> giving rise to access specific rules from table <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thus in the example shown, telephone number 11111-111-111 (see <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>) has an account identity &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The rules from <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> give a start point for the particular user so that according to rule <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, if the calling line identity is 02345 678 901 2 AND it is between 12 mid day and 3 p.m. (1500 hrs) on the Feb. 29, 2000 the call is to be directed to 01234 567 8902. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Any call directed to the same number on Jan. 1, 2000 between 8.00 am and 6 p.m. (1800 hrs) is to be directed to 01234 567 8901 (rule 2) otherwise (rule 1) the call is to be redirected to 01 234 567 8900. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The appropriate destination will be reflected to the gateway <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the incoming call redirected accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Thus the rule identity (col. 222) in accordance with the account identity (col. 223) uses the CLIs (signalling conditions col. 224) in combination with start date (col. 225) and end date (col. 226) and start time (col. 227) and end time (col. 228) to determine a destination (col. 229). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the routing rules interface as it appears to a user using Microsoft Outlook for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the user enters an appointment in the calendar program the telephony tab opens a window offering telephony options for this appointment. Thus call diversion provides a drop down screen offering a number of options with an alternative of a single click diversion to an answering service such as the British Telecommunications plc network based answering service known as Call Minder (Trademark). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The telephony option also permits a network generated reminder to be sent again using a drop down screen offering the reminder for signalling to (e.g.) a pager, home telephone, desk telephone, mobile telephone or other node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The routing routes in the example given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> are confined to being conditional on the fields that the database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> provides. Thus they may be conditional on dates and times and the system is slightly inflexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> However, using active script processing and agent &ldquo;helpers&rdquo; a far more flexible call diversion function may be provided. Thus referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when the gateway <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> forwards a message to the routing application to query the database, the SQL query message to the database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> results in a return message to the application function <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> which returns a script and optionally a helper identity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Thus referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when the processing from the database <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> provides a simple script identity a script engine <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> runs the script using the relevant data extracted directly from the database at the time of an incoming call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 a</cross-reference> simple script using DDI (direct Dialling In) CLI (Calling Line Identity) and TLI (Destination telephone line identity) runs using the calendar and telephony rules associated with a particular user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Now, as shown by script <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> (derived from the account id and virtual telephone id), the primary rule looks first at the CLI to determine if the CLI is &ldquo;P&rdquo;. All calls originating from &ldquo;P&rdquo; are routed to the user&apos;s mobile telephone so that the script returns the mobile telephone number to the gateway and terminates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If the CLI is not &ldquo;P&rdquo; the CLI is now examined to determine if the call is from CLI &ldquo;Q&rdquo; or CLI &ldquo;R&rdquo; and if so the time of day is considered so that calls from &ldquo;Q&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; are routed to a call answering function before 9 am or after 5 pm (i.e. calls outside normal office hours). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> All calls not from P, Q or R are routed to the office telephone number as will calls originating from Q and R during normal office hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thus the script shown may return one of three destinations to the gateway these being the user&apos;s mobile telephony number, call minder address or office telephone number. The simple script here does not take account of user calendar information, only of call origin and time of day. However, it will be realised that calendar information may be introduced in to the rules in a similar manner to that hereinbefore described </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It will however be appreciated that day of week or other simple rules may be simply introduced to a script determining a preferential order and ending with a default condition for any call not previously captured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the profile scripting may include additional destinations or multiple destinations to which selected calls may be sequentially routed in the event that the call is not answered within a pre-determined period. In a further alternative profile multiple destinations may be connected simultaneously to ensure that at least one connection may be effected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A more complex script using a helper is to be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> to which reference is now made. In this example the routing rules are too complex to be expressed and cannot be directly evaluated in the application script. Thus on receipt of a call the script identity is returned as before together with one or more helper identities. The helper classes are loaded dynamically at run time. Helpers return Boolean results (yes/no). Accordingly after considering a specific appointment during which all calls are routed to the call answering service (If date &equals;Feb. 29, 2000 and time is between 1400 and 1500) the program uses the InMeeting helper which will use time and date information to consult the user profile Calendar data and if the answer from the InMeeting helper is YES then the IsContact helper is launched to determine if the meeting is with &ldquo;P&rdquo; and if the answer is again YES then the call is routed to the user&apos;s mobile telephony number. If the answer returned by either of these helpers is no, then the InMeeting helper is again launched and if a YES is returned the incoming call is routed to the call answering service. A NO return from the helper ensures that the default routing of the User&apos;s Office telephone number is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the invention provides a simple reminder function using the calendar facility. Thus if the user calendar function passes a reminder request message to the application suite a script is returned together with helpers if required. The script is processed to provide a destination for the reminder call which may cause a pager message, voice message to mobile/desk/home telephone or a computer message display. </paragraph>
