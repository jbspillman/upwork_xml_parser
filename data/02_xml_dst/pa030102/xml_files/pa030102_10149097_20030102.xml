<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for displaying and assisting manipulative movements when operating an operating device for a piece of functional equipment, for example, a telephone, a mobile telephone, a remote control unit, a text and/or character transmitter, a calculator, an electronic planner, a portable, hand-held or stationary computer (e.g., PC or mini-PC), a music center, a camera, game equipment, alarm equipment, admission control equipment, control equipment or the like, where the operating device is actuatable by an operator&apos;s finger to execute at least two function commands. Displayed on the display panel are at least three discrete fields and/or sub-fields of selectively optional functions and/or designation and/or characters, the operating device thus being able to actuate at least three options. At least one further manipulation of the operating device will cause at least one successive selection to be made on the basis of or starting from a preceding selection of said functions and/or designations and/or characters. The selections made are displayed and used in or by the functional equipment. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for displaying and assisting manipulative movements when operating an operating device for a piece of functional equipment, as disclosed in the preamble in the independent patent claims below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Today&apos;s mobile telephones incorporate a great number of functions in addition to the usual telephone functions, and they are equipped with a memory like that of small computers. This means that a user can build up information, for example, telephone numbers and address lists. Technological advance has reached mobile telephones which are being developed as complete communicators for text, pictures and speech by using, among things, the Internet as used on a personal computer (PC). A new format for this application is called WAP and is a standard for Internet services used on GSM telephones. All these new services and functions will require simpler, logical and efficient methods for handling all the information, entering data and navigation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the prior art reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,808,602, 6,016,142 and 6,031,471. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed for use in various electronic apparatus, preferably mobile telephones, to allow simple, logical, reliable and efficient operation of the apparatus through functions and menus, and also in simple operations, as may be required, for example, when operating a mobile telephone to dial a number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention described will be programmable as software in hardware that is used today in computers and other electronic apparatus. Therefore, such programming is not described in detail, as anyone with a knowledge of such technology will understand how the invention can be implemented via software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although the following description will relate primarily to the use of the invention with mobile telephones, this should by no means be understood as limiting for the present invention, as it could just as easily be used with, for example, ordinary telephones, remote control units, text and/or character transmitters, calculators, electronic planners, portable, hand-held or stationary computer equipment (e.g., PCs, mini-PCs), music centres, cameras, games equipment, alarm equipment, admittance control equipment, control equipment or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, an essential feature of the invention is that the operating device should be actuatable by an operator&apos;s finger to be able to execute at least two function commands.</paragraph>
</summary-of-invention>
<brief-description-of-drawings>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The operating devices described in the following description and shown in the drawings and also operating devices of a similar kind are described in detail in, for example, the applicant&apos;s International Patent Application PCT/NO99/00373 and Norwegian Patent Applications 19995520, 20000819 and 20003974, and the description and drawings in these applications are included herein by means of this reference, thereby making it unnecessary to further elucidate technical details in the following description and the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a mobile telephone where the keypad is composed of a total of 19 buttons, of which four, indicated by means of the reference numerals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are navigation switches/arrow keys in connection with the telephone display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In a telephone with simple functions, the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can, as shown, optionally be replaced by an array of light-emitting diodes. When turned on, the telephone will normally be in a ringing mode, i.e., ready for the input of a number in order to make a call. To switch to another function, for instance, to read Internet pages, the use of arrow keys, for example, to the right, will take the user into a menu overview, where by further use of an arrow key a desired function can be selected. The system is so constructed that the numbers, letters and functions desired will be presented on the display in, for example, three rows. The number of rows may, however, be increased, but with the proposed keypad design they would have to be increased, if desired, to 3&times;2-3-4 etc. It is desirable to be able to divide each row into groups of four. This will be most relevant in connection with the keying-in of letters for the input of a text on the display. A more detailed description of this will be given below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When keying in a number, it is possible to use the ordinary numeric keypad or the arrow keys, the digits being distributed across the display as they appear on the keypad (this solution will be described later where the system is used without a push-button keypad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As the need for input of text in connection with text messages, e-mail and other Internet services in mobile telephones increases, the use of today&apos;s system and keypad will become rather laborious. The system for this keypad solution functions as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the display in the text mode will of necessity have to show the whole alphabet split into three columns. Each group of letters is represented under each number key. For example, the user may choose the left-hand column and wish to key in the letter A. In this case, the letter A will be found on the numeric keypad under the number 1. The number key 1 in this case is pressed twice. If the user wishes to key in, e.g., the letter S, he selects the number 3 on the numeric keypad, followed by the number 1. If the user then wishes to enter the letter K, he depresses the number key 2 twice. If the user then wishes to select, e.g., the letter H, he first selects the number 7, and then presses the number key 8. As an alternative to the above, the user may select columns by using the arrow keys. The column the user selects will be highlighted, so that the user will always see which column is activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the solution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the letters may also be assembled in groups of four, distributed in three rows. Here, it is possible to choose whether all the groups should be visible on the display, or whether it is desirable to fetch up three groups at a time. Of course, this depends on the size of the display, here indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;. This solution will be described in more detail for use with other kinds of keypads, since it is not primarily made for a keypad having many keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For navigation in menus and for the Internet (for example, WAP), the four arrow keys will be used for looking through menus and pages on the screen. This is in fact known from today&apos;s technology. A large display can be divided into columns and rows in which the user clicks his way forwards, backwards, up and down. Each row is divided into groups that have four sub-functions which the user can easily choose between by using the arrow keys. As the screens are now becoming large and with large resolution, it will be possible to put icons on the screen, as in a personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, the method which must be used in connection with the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> is cumbersome in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The system according to the invention which will now be described is based on an embodiment of a keypad with a switch that has three or possibly four depression positions, and can also be pushed into, for example, four positions. It will be described below on the basis of a 4&times;4 position keypad where the keypad or operating device is basically arranged in a 3&times;4 system, with a fourth additional function for certain tasks, and in this connection reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The movement for the sliding positions and the movement up and down on the screen, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the reference numeral <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, will be described as the Y-direction, whilst the side positions and movement to the sides of the screen will be described as movement in the X-direction. In the quite mode, the display screen <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, will show all numbers in a pattern known from an ordinary push-button keyboard. This mode will also be the ringing mode for the mobile telephone. In this mode, the selection of numbers is controlled by the movement of the control element or the key 8, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in the four Y-positions, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and movement of the control element or the key 8 in the X-direction, i.e., in depression position <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As an example, in order to dial the eight-digit number 22988890, the following movements of the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be made. The control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved to the position Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is shown in position Y<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), and the key 9 is depressed with a repetition, which gives the number 22. Subsequently, the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved down to position Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>where the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pressed at the marking <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which gives the composite number 229. The control element is then depressed twice at the marking <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which gives the composite number 22988. Subsequently, the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is depressed at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which gives the composite number 2298889. Next, the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved into position Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, whereupon depression of the control element at the marking <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will give the complete desired number 22988890 Depression of the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the marking <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will result in the call being initiated, i.e., the mobile telephone initiates an ordinary dialling function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The solution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> can be used to explain a write mode related to, for example, a mobile telephone. The control mode can be defined as a function selected from a menu that requires the input of a text, for example, telephone book, text message, e-mail, the input of an Internet address etc. In the write mode, the whole of or part of the alphabet will be shown on the display <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Of course, this will depend on both the size and resolution that the display <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can provide. According to a proposed embodiment, the alphabet will be divided into three rows having groups each consisting of four letters. For example, to write the word &ldquo;Her&rdquo;, the following functions must be performed, and here reference is also made to a control element as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. First, the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is depressed at the marking <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to select the middle group in the selected Y-direction. Here, the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in the position Y4X2. The user is now in a mode where the markings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> represent F, G, H and E respectively. The control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position or marking <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which gives the letter H. After this, the system returns automatically to the first step. Next, to select E, the marking <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is pressed first to select the middle group, and then the marking <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to select the letter E, and HE will become visible on the display. After this, the system again returns automatically to the first step. Movement of the control element to position Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and depression of the marking <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will result in the position Y3X2 being selected. Selection of the letter R is now desired, and this is done by depressing the marking <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that HER is now displayed on the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This principle can, of course, be subjected to variations, as it is possible to add extra keys that alone can provide movements on the display screen, whilst the keying-in takes place by the use of the operating device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Recently, modern mobile telephones have been equipped with a vast amount of functions, and developments suggest that it is desired to implement even more and more functions into mobile telephones. Mobile telephones will then almost be like small computers with programs, files and folders. To be able to find what is wanted from among all this data, the use of an operating device as mentioned above will be suitable in a system where the main groups in the menu are shown on the display <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at any given time. Under each main function, sub-functions will be divided into a system of groups of four. The menu may conceivably be built up as follows: Each function will be divided into groups of four that can be selected quickly by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the markings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In reality, Internet access for mobile telephones will soon be a fact. Having connected to the Internet, the user can browse through the various pages by using the pressing function <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The pointer function can be controlled by sliding in the Y-direction and movement in the X-direction by pressing or holding the control element down at the markings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The switch between page function and pointer function can be assigned to the marking on the control element <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, confirmation should be assigned to the position on the control element indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 31</cross-reference> show an operating device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which has been given three X input positions and four Y sliding positions, where the X-positions are indicated by X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and the Y-positions are indicated by Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Connected to this operating device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a light diode array as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, where <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> diodes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, are arranged in a light matrix consisting of three columns and four rows. In each Y-position (sliding position), a marking is made in that all light diodes (in this case <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) will shine faintly. Keying to the right, left or in the middle (X-position) will cause the light diode for the position is question to light up. When using this switch for a mobile telephone, numbers and symbols will be arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and for the keying-in of letters, the alphabet will be arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> When keying in a number, such as 22988894, the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be pushed into the uppermost position (Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), and the control element is depressed in the centre position which gives a digit 2 for the position X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The depression is repeated so that the number 22 is generated on the display screen. Next, the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to the position Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and depression is effected on the right-hand side (X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), so that the number 229 appears. Then the centre portion (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of the switch element is depressed, and this depression is carried out twice so that the number 22988 appears first, followed by 229888. Subsequently, the right-hand side of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is depressed, which produces the number <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, represented by X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Then the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to position Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and depression is effected on the left-hand side of the control element (see X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), which gives the digit 4, so that the desired telephone number 22988894 now appears as a result of a long depression at position X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. A long depression at position X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>will cause the telephone to start to dial chosen number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In connection with key entry of letters, the system can be opened as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. When a group has been selected, one of three letters is selected by pressing to the right, to the left or on the middle of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, the word &ldquo;Hallo&rdquo; is to be written, since, for example, a text message has been selected. The position Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is selected. The letter group <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is selected, and the X<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>side of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is depressed. The letters G, H, I will then become assigned to X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and X<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>respectively. Depression of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for position X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will result in the letter H being produced. Then the system returns automatically to &ldquo;Select letter group&rdquo;. In this case Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is selected, and then X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>followed by X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>again, which gives the letter A, so that HA is now displayed. Next, Y<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is selected and the control element is depressed at X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and then X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which gives the letter L, so that HAL now stands on the display. The last operation is repeated so that the letters HALL appear on the display. Then the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is held down a little longer at position X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, whereupon the control element is depressed at the X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>position (centre point) and then at the X<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>position, which gives the additional letter O, so that in the end the word HALLO appears on the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A similar example as now described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 8</cross-reference> respectively in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> can also be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. It will be seen in these figures that the individual letters or numbers selected may be marked so that it is easier to see which field is referred to or which letter is referred to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a mobile telephone with two operating devices of different types. These operating devices are indicated by means of the reference numerals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively. Operation in connection with an operating device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> will be described in detail in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The operating device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be of the same type per se as that shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The operating device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is particularly well suited for functions such as navigation on the display screen, consisting of a central key <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having four functions, and a rotating wheel or disc <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which in addition can also be depressed at four positions. The input of numbers, letters and symbols can be carried as described in the above by using the operating device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Navigation in a menu and in the different functions possible in, for example, a mobile telephone will advantageously be effected by the use of the operating device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, i.e., by the use of the centre key or a first control element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the wheel/disc <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, i.e., a so-called second control element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The display screen will show the main functions and by using the central key <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> the various functions desired can be selected. The functions will be arranged in a system of groups of four with sub-groups of four, until the user reaches his desired destination. If the user chooses to browse through a list or search up/down/to the right/to the left on the display screen, the rotating wheel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> When using the Internet, a user can by means of a combination of the central key <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the wheel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> navigate a pointer around on the display screen to make his desired choices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows how an operating device as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> could be used to manoeuvre in a menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a display screen <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in connection with an operating device of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and where the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown in its starting position. On depression in the centre of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a menu appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, and at the same time the bottom row is marked. Moving the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the position Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, will cause the row for Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to be marked. Depression of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the position X<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>will result in the symbol III appearing at the top of the display in the illustrated example, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. A subsequent movement down to position Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>will cause a scrolling of the menu image, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The control element can then be moved down to the position for Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, where in the illustrated example the numerals XV, XVI and XVII are now marked on the display. Depression of, for example, the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at position X<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>will result in the symbol for XVII appearing at the top of the display screen <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows another example for the use of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a menu is selected by a central depression (position X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The menu thus appears, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and by a further depression of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when it is in position Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and depression in position X, the user will go to the next stage in the menu, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. On movement of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the position Y<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and depression thereof at position X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, a further menu image appears, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. If this image is not wanted, the user can, for example, in position Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, depress the element at position X<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which causes a return to the menu image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. On a central depression of the operating device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in position Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the menu image will return to the original image, as was shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>shows how the menu image appears after a central depression of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the central position X<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>thereof When the control element is moved to position Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the field <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the menu is marked, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. In this position, the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is, for example, depressed at position X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, which means that the user moves on in the menu as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>. By then going to position Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, it is possible to proceed in the menu. The same applies to that shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>shows how the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to the position Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and where depression of the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in position X<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>results in the establishment of a connection with, for example, a news page, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l </italic></highlight>also shows that when the control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved down into position Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a central depression of the control element (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is effected, a return is made to the original screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>. From -this starting-position, it is possible to move on in the menu, for example, by depressing the control element at position X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, so that the image in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>is established. From that point, it is also possible to go to, for example, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>o. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that what has been illustrated and described thus far is intended solely as an illustration of the many possibilities of the invention without it thus being understood as in any way defining the limits of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 16</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will now be described in more detail in connection with an operating device such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>, or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The operating device used in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is based on a control element that is 360&deg;-rotatable, and which at positions, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> as 3 o&apos;clock, 6 o&apos;clock, 9 o&apos;clock and 12 o&apos;clock, can be depressed to activate switches <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The 12 o&apos;clock position will be related to a primary function, as for instance &ldquo;Clear&rdquo;. These switches will in turn be able to activate selected functions in a menu. As an alternative, instead of being arranged under the control element <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at its periphery, the switches <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be arranged at the periphery of the control element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, and where the switches are indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime;. That shown and described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is based on an operating device as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, there is a screen image <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated, the numbers 1, 2, 3 appear at the bottom. If, for example, the user wishes to dial the telephone number 22988892, he must come to a stop as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and depress the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> twice, so that the switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is activated, and thus causes the number 2 to be selected twice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Turning the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further causes another row of numbers 7, 8, 9 to appear, and the control element is now depressed at the switch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> Se, whereby the number 9 appears on the display. Then the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, i</cross-reference>.e., that the switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is activated, and as a result the digit 8 appears on the display screen <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>This depression is repeated twice, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>respectively, to produce the digit 8 two more times. Then the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, so that the digit 9 is produced on the screen. This causes the switch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to be activated. Then the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned to produce the row of numbers shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereupon the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. As shown in <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>, the digit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will thus appear so that the complete telephone number 22988892 appears on the display <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then rotated until the option for &ldquo;Call&rdquo;, &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Store&rdquo; appears at the bottom of the display screen <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l</italic></highlight>. If &ldquo;Call&rdquo; is desired, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>(&ldquo;Call&rdquo;), i.e., activation of the switch <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, whereby a call is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> After the call has been made, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>will appear with the option of choosing, with the aid of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, between &plus; or &minus; volume adjustment during the call, hang-up or back to menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, there will now follow a brief explanation of how a control element as shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 19</cross-reference>, can be used to establish, for example, a text that is to be sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a starting position corresponding to that seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Depression of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, i.e., switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, will cause the menu to be activated. A menu image thus appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and by turning the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, it is possible to allow the cursor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to move up or down on the screen <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Placing the cursor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, for example, on menu I and depressing the control element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, i.e., activation of the switch <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, will cause an image, for example like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, to appear. In the present example, the word &ldquo;hello&rdquo; is to be written. This means that it is necessary to move forward in the alphabet in relation to the letters A, B, C, that are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. This is done by rotating the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, until the sequence of letters G, H and I appears, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Depression of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>will cause the letter h to be marked and appear as selected on the screen <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. Then the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated again, preferably in the opposite direction, to get to the row of letters D, E, F, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, where the letter e is marked and the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown, whereby switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is activated and the letter e thus appears on the display, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>shows. Then the letter I is to be written twice, which means that the control element must be rotated again to be able to move forward in the alphabet, so that the letters J, K and L appear, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>. In the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed twice to activate the switch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> twice, thus causing the letter I to appear twice on the display, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>indicates. Then the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated again a short step so that the row of letters M, N and O appear, and the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l</italic></highlight>, i.e., activation of switch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, whereby the letter o appears as the last letter of the desired word, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>shows. If message is to be sent, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be rotated again until the option as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>appears at the bottom of the screen. The selection of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and the depression of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position for the switch <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> will cause the image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>o </italic></highlight>to appear. Here, rotation of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will cause either the text or the cursor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to move up or down on the screen. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>p</italic></highlight>, a affirmative selection of address book is made by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the position shown, i.e., activation of the switch <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The address book then appears with several alternative addresses and by turning the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the cursor can be placed on the desired address, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>r</italic></highlight>. The control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed is this position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>r</italic></highlight>, i.e., activation of the switch <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, which causes the appearance of a question regarding the sending of the message to the addressee (it being assumed that the mobile telephone knows the addressee&apos;s telephone number). Selection of the affirmative, i.e., depression of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(activation of the switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>), will result in the addressee&apos;s telephone number being dialled, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight>. After the message has been sent, a message for the user to that effect appears with a question regarding any new message. Three options are given, and in the illustrated example, the user has selected &ldquo;No&rdquo; by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position for the switch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, whereby the display on the screen <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> returns to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Something similar to that shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The explanation given in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also holds good for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned until the cursor lies on, e.g., menu IV. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, this menu can be selected by depressing the control element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, i.e., activation of switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A sub-menu as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>thus appears, and the cursor will naturally remain at the same place as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, since the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has not been rotated further. Further depression of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, i.e., activation of the switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, will cause the address IV to be selected, whereby there appears, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, for example, a news page with options. If the user wishes to select the connection &ldquo;link&rdquo;, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned until the marker <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> lies on this connection. Here, this connection is selected, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown, whereby there appears in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>a display &ldquo;WAP info&rdquo;. If the user does not want this, or wishes to go back to the last screen image, return can be selected, i.e., by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, whereby the user can return to a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, which is identical with that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>. By turning the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is possible to browse through the news page, so that the screen image that appears in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>will be the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>If this is not wanted either, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, i.e., &ldquo;Back&rdquo; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), whereby the screen image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reappears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the additional embodiment exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the menu is selected by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position that can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(activation of switch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). The menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>thus appears. If the user wishes, for example, to select X, the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be turned so that the cursor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> moves down to the row in the menu image in which X appears. Depression of the control element at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>causes the Roman numeral X to be selected. This Roman numeral can optionally represent an addressee, a telephone number or the like. In the illustrated example, the user has chosen not to go on and has therefore depressed the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, whereby the screen image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>appears and is like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Although the use of Roman numerals is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>by way of example, entirely different symbols or text can of course be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Of course, that shown and described above in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will merely serve to help the understanding of the principles of the invention with regard to a substantially simpler manoeuvring on a display screen than has been possible hitherto by operating a large number of keys, as is commonly known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> it is shown how the switches <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>&prime;-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; can be used in connection with a control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> instead of switches <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that are under the face of the actual control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, the mode of operation is the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows how, as an alternative, there may be a first control element SI and a second control element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, where the first control element is made non-rotatable, but tiltable to one of four possible positions for associated activation of switches <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. However, to make it possible to browse through a menu, the other control element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided, which is 360&deg;-rotatable and, like the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is preferably stepwise rotatable. Detecting of the rotation of the control element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may, for example, be done by means of optical reading. The same applies to the control element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, electromechanical devices to detect the rotation of these control elements are also conceivable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The menu control shown and described in connection with the preceding figures and with particular reference to the type of operating device that can be seen from, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, will also be carried out with the aid of an operating device as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, consisting of a so-called touch pad <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> or a touch screen, for example, in connection with a display screen. A division of the touch pad or touch screen into fields that can be defined as X and Y coordinates will allow movements in the menu to be made easily. The actual technology related to such touch pads or touch screens is known per se and does not need to be described in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the use of another operating device which has a number of features similar to those of the operating device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, but which is tiltable in several directions, here shown having four possibilities, at the same time as the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the operating device is movable along a path and with a stepwise movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows by way of example a screen image <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> where there are options for writing an SMS message, e-mail or using the &ldquo;notepad&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Depression of the control element as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>effects, for example, the selection of SMS. If, for instance, the letters Ab are to be written, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will appear first. A short depression on the marked spot for ABC will cause the letter field for the letters abc as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to appear. The letter A is chosen here by using the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to effect a long depression (as opposed to a short depression if a were to be chosen instead), whereby the letter A appears on the screen as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Then the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is depressed briefly at the marked spot, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, whereby the letter b appears on the screen. If, for example, a space is required between letters, for instance, when several words are written, the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be depressed at the indicated spot, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>(indicated by dotted lines), whereby, also by way of example, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>will appear with the options of returning to the last image or moving forwards or backwards in the text to make spaces between letters or words. The screen image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>also gives the option of sending the message by depressing the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>when the control element has been moved to the bottom position. On depression as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, a question-will appear with regard to the telephone number to which the text message (SMS) should be sent, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>appearing. The text message as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>is Ab, and this will now be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It will thus be understood that when only one letter field, e.g., abc, is shown, slight pressure on the marked spot on the control element will produce a lower-case letter, e.g., b, whilst prolonged pressure will produce an upper-case letter, e.g., A, although in the letter field only lower-case letters appear. This is made possible by pre-setting the apparatus in which the invention is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, on selection there appears a letter field ABC DEF GHI and below an additional field containing numbers and letters. The capacity to show letters in a first transverse field and numbers/characters/&ldquo;non-current&rdquo; letters or the like in a second transverse field is made possible by pre-setting in a setting program for the apparatus in which the invention is used. It will be obvious to the skilled person to understand how this can be done and therefore it not described in more detail here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> By pushing the control element against spring action about half a movement step (marked by short dashes), it is possible by repeated movements of this kind to switch between the first and the second field. When the top field (containing letters) is selected in this way, a double letter field for the letters abc and ABC will appear at the indicated spot on the depression of the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>the letter A is selected by a long depression as indicated. This letter then appears on the screen <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Brief pressure on the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the indicated direction will cause the cursor, as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, come to rest in the field containing the letters abc, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, and the letter b will be activated. After this, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>appears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> If the text message Ab is to be sent, the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can, for example, be moved to a position as shown and explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, and depression of the control element can be effected as shown there. As a result, a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>will appear. From there, it is possible to move on, as will be explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> (from and including <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), for example by keying in a telephone number and sending the SMS message to that number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it is possible to return to a first screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l </italic></highlight>(and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and actuate the control element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as shown, whereby a menu appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>. Selection of, for example, a phone book will result in the appearance of an address list/list of subscribers, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Additional aspects of the invention can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Initially, the screen image may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The display here is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, whilst the control element is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. However, it will be understood that the operating device of which the control element is an integral part could be identical with the operating device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the chosen example, moving the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> closer to the display <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will cause a screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to appear. If, for example, the user wishes to select the telephone number 22 98 88 92, the operating device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. It must be depressed twice to generate the number 22 on the display <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When the number 9 is then to be selected, the control element is moved to a position which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is marked as 35, whereafter the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is depressed at the point indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, whereby the number 9 appears on the screen. Next, the control element is depressed three times whilst still in the same position to produce three <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s</italic></highlight>, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, whereafter the control element is depressed at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>to produce the number 9. Then the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved to the position <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to produce a last digit in the telephone number, i.e., 2, the control element at this position being depressed at the point indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved to the bottom position or the position <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> where the options of &ldquo;Call&rdquo;, &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Store&rdquo; appear. Here, it is possible to press on the control element at the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>to initiate a call. As an alternative, the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be depressed at the spot shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>, whereby cancellation takes place. The last action according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>will cause the main menu to reappear, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>l</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>shows how the menu can be selected, whereby a screen image appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. By allowing the control element to remain in the bottom position, it will be the bottom option of those shown that is marked. If the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is moved to the top position, it will be the top alternative in the menu that is marked and can be selected. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>o</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>p </italic></highlight>the option to move on in the main menu is selected, whereby there appears an option for accessories, for example, in connection with a mobile telephone. If the control element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is depressed at the point shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>q</italic></highlight>, the screen image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>will appear, which will be the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference><highlight><italic>o. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> it is shown how a simple telephone number, for example, 22 98, can easily be produced. A screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be the starting point. Depression of a control element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the point marked as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a repetition of this depression will cause, for example, the number 22 to appear. Subsequently, the control element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> must be moved two position notches away along a movement path to position <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, whereby the numbers 7, 8 and 9 appear on the screen. Then, the number 9 is selected by pressing on the control element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. This is followed by a depression of the control element as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. This last operation will cause the whole number 22 98 to appear on the display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Of course, that now shown and described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is included here to illustrate the versatility of the system according to the present invention. It will also be understood that operating devices other than that shown in these figures could quite easily be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it will be understood that by using a single control element as shown, it will be possible, via the display that takes place on the display screen, to carry out all necessary operations without having to resort to indications in connection with buttons on a keypad. This makes the individual operations that have to be carried out easier and faster to carry out than when using a traditional keypad. An additional advantage is, for example, that both lower-case and upper-case letters, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, can be displayed and selected, simply by using the control element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows an operating device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is a variant of the operating device shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this case, the control element can consist of two parts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, each of which may have three tilting points, so that in actual fact there are six options in connection with a control element of this kind, in addition to the stepwise positions of the control element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows yet another embodiment of the present embodiment wherein a control element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is used that is preferably stepwise movable along a path <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. That shown on the screen has a direct relation to that which has otherwise been shown and described in detail in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 13</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The control element <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is connected to a switch function that is activated by depression of the control element. This possible depression is indicated by x in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Along the path of movement <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the control element <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> there are push buttons <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which are connected to their respective switch functions. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, depression of the control element <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will cause a menu to be selected. A screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will thus appear. If it is desirable to move on in the menu, the key <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be depressed. A new screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>then appears. If the sub-menu <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is to be selected, the key 45 is depressed again, whereupon the screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>appears. If this is not wanted, the key 46 can be depressed, whereby the option &ldquo;Back&rdquo; is selected, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, so that the menu as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and repeated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>appears. If this is not wanted either, the control element can be maintained in the bottom position and depressed, whereby the image shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is cleared via the clear function, whereby the screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will reappear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The screen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is indicated in general by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As will be understood, the present invention can be used with many different types of operating devices without the choice of operating device being perceived as defining the limits of the use of the invention. It will also be appreciated that the possible variations that exist in connection with the present invention as regards screen image and options within the screen images can virtually be &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;tailored&rdquo;, depending on the area of use or the functional equipment in which the invention is to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Some of the operating devices that may conceivably be used in conjunction with the present invention have already been described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A further possible operating device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>. The operating device here consists of a first control element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a second control element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The first control element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is depressible and displaceable relative to a central position thereof, so that in reality it can be used as a control device for a cursor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The cursor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can, for example, be used to initiate functions connected to icons <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, as shown by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. The second control element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is stepwise rotatable through 360&deg; and is depressible at positions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to activate respective switches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the second control element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> could be used to browse through menu alternatives and optionally to select from the individual menu alternatives by means of depression in connection with positions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in order to activate respective switches <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Within the various menu alternatives, the first control element can either be used as an ordinary push-button (without the possibility of controlling the cursor), or whilst within other menu alternatives where, for example, icons <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are present, it could be used for cursor control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the operating device that is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. The control element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is initially movable as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, i.e., depressible centrally and to the sides, and also stepwise movable along a slideway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows an alternative to the operating device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. In this figure, there is also a control element, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, that has the same possibilities of movement potential, as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. Common to all the control elements that are slidable along a movement path is that the open space in the movement path can successively increasingly or decreasingly be covered by lamellae <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. Similar use of lamellae will, for example, be relevant with that shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> show yet more embodiments of operating devices that may be suitable for use with the present invention. The use of the operating devices to wander through menus is not described in any detail in connection with these embodiments, as the same or similar wandering in menus as shown and described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or variants of these could also be carried out using the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In general, in the embodiments according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> a display screen is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and may be of any suitable type, for example, like the display screens previously shown and described or variants thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> there is a control element <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> consisting of a first central part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, plus a second part <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a third part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The second part <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the third part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are located on their respective opposite sides of the first part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. All the parts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are depressible and are connected to a switch function. The first part is depressible as indicated by the symbol <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> or downwardly tiltable as indicated by the symbols <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. At its ends that are indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and at the central position as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the first part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will be capable of actuating a respective switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In connection with the variant shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the control element is generally indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The control element consists of a first part <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, a second part <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, a third part <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, a fourth part <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a fifth part <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. The first part <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, the second part <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the third part <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are arranged in succession in a first direction (y-direction) and the fourth part <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the second part <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the fifth part <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are arranged in succession transverse to the first direction (the y-direction), i.e., in the x-direction. In reality, the parts <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> replace the functions connected to the respective areas <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> on the first part <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Control element parts <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are each connected to a switch function for activating, when depressed, a respective switch (not shown) so as to initiate functions in an operation menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows a control element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that consists of a first central part <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, plus a second part <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and a third part <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> that are located on their respective opposite sides of the first part <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. The parts <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> are depressible and connected to a respective switch function. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the first part is displaceable forwards and backwards relative to the central position thereof, the central position being shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this way, the first part will be able to actuate switch functions that become operative when the first part is moved away from its central position, as indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows a control element <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> that consists of a rotatable wheel <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. The wheel is stepwise rotatable and will be connected to a detector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to detect the stepwise rotation of the wheel, which can be used, for example, to browse through a menu. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the wheel is connected to switch functions, where switches are symbolically indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for detecting respectively sideways tilting of the wheel <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and depression thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> the control element is indicated in general by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It consists of a rotatable wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and in connection with the stepwise rotation of the wheel there may be provided a detector, such as the detector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to detect rotation. The wheel is preferably centrally depressible to initiate a respective switch function, such as the activation of a switch <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in connection with the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. However, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> it is proposed that the wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> should not be tiltable sideways, but that the switches <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>should instead be replaced by switches <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> that are adjacent to respective side faces of the wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> shows a control element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> consisting of a stepwise rotatable roller <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. There is a detector <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for detecting the stepwise rotation of the cylinder. The roller <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is centrally depressible and also sideways depressible at its respective axial ends so as to actuate a respective switch <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. On central depression of the roller <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, both switches <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, the control element is indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The control element in this figure consists of a stepwise rotatable roller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is connected to a detector similar to the detector <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for detecting the rotation. The roller is centrally depressible so as to initiate a respective switch function, such as the activation of switches <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or a single switch (not shown) that detects the central depression of the roller. Adjacent to respective axial ends of the roller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> there is provided a depressible key <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that is connected to a respective switch function, symbolised by the switches <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> shows a control element <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> consisting of a stepwise movable, continuous belt that runs over rollers <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The control element <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> has means <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> for detecting the stepwise movement of the belt, and a switch means <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is provided in connection with the belt for detecting central depression of the belt. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the control element <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is not only centrally depressible, but also sideways tiltable and in this connection switches <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be provided to be activated when the control element <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is tilted to one side or the other. Of course, it is also conceivable that the control element <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> at its longitudinal, respective ends can be depressible so as to initiate a switch function, exemplified by switches <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> the control element is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and consists of a stepwise movable, continuous belt <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> that runs over rollers at respective ends thereof, as outlined in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Here too, the control element has means for detecting the stepwise movement of the belt, as for instance the means <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Also in this case, the belt part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the control element <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> will be centrally depressible so as to be able to initiate a switch function, as shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. It is of course also conceivable that the belt-shaped part of the control element can be depressible at its longitudinal respective ends, in order to initiate a switch function there, as symbolised by the switches <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Along respective longitudinal sides of the belt-shaped part there is arranged a depressible key <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to enable activation of a respective switch <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&prime;. The switch <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&prime; thus in fact replaces the switches <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> All the solutions shown and described have one thing in common, namely that the user needs only concern himself with that shown on the display screen to be able to control the operating device. Thus, manipulation of the operating device and the functions activated thereby will at all times be represented on the display. It is thus possible to avoid a large number of function switches, as known from apparatus such as mobile telephones, to be able to enter a text and/or dial a telephone number. All functions and the options permitted by the invention will be shown on the display screen, and marking on the operation panel will therefore be unnecessary. Normally, when the operating device is activated, a display screen will be illuminated, making it possible to operate the operating device in a straightforward and practical manner without having to take into account marking on the switch panel, as is known and where such marking can be difficult to read in poor lighting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The invention will also be usable in connection with the overriding of a system for displaying on a display panel information that the piece of functional equipment is preprogrammed to interpret as more important than the operations and functions effected by manipulation of the operating device. In this connection, reference can be made to that taught in the applicant&apos;s Norwegian Patent Applications Nos. 20000834 and 20003579. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In connection with that shown and described, it is possible in a further development of the invention to incorporate, for example, in connection with letter combinations generated by successive input of letters, a word list, so that in actual fact it is not necessary to key in all the letters to produce, for example, the addressee&apos;s name. Several mobile telephone manufacturers have started to use a system known as &ldquo;T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&rdquo; supplied by the company Tegic which functions in the same way when texts are entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> On an ordinary mobile telephone keypad a key usually has groups of three letters. If, for example, the keys def and tuv are pressed, the system will guess at the word &ldquo;det&rdquo; for instance. If tuv, def and jkl are chosen, the word &ldquo;tel&rdquo;, for example, is guessed. When three keys are pressed, the system thus has 27 possible combinations to guess the right word from. The system merely guesses words with same number of letters as key presses. A weakness of this known system is that assumptions are made when the system does not know the word that is to be keyed in. This means that the user must use the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; key to carry on, which will entail a great number of key presses in total. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of further development of the present application, letters and characters can be placed in groups of three as before. Each letter is selected by using the operating device and by depressing it to the left, the right or in the middle, optionally with the use of a device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24, 25</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, or optionally with a device according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It is proposed, according to the invention, to make the system in such a way that when words that are not already in the word list are entered, they are stored and assigned a priority number. All the words in the word list will be capable of being assigned priority/points in relation to how many times the word is used. The system will begin to guess at words as the letters are entered. If the system makes a wrong guess, the user simply continues to key in the word. A space will confirm the word so that it can also be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> For example, the words TELENOSTRA, TELENOR and TELEFON are found in the word list. The user starts to key in TEL. The system will in this case guess the whole word TELENOSTRA if that word has most points. However, the system will guess TELEFON if the word &ldquo;telefon&rdquo; is used most The same would happen if the word TELENOR had most points. To proceed, the user continues to key in TELEN. In this case, the system would guess the right word, namely TELENOSTRA, if this word had more points than the word TELENOR. Otherwise TELENOR would of course have been chosen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Basically, with a system of this kind it is possible to save many key presses, i.e., in the example above the user simply keys in TEL and gets TELENOSTRA, if this last word is the one most used or has greatest priority or most points for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the known solution in connection with the said system &ldquo;T9&rdquo; it is necessary to have a key press for each letter. With a system that guesses at words, the user will thus save considerable time if the system make the right guesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The known system &ldquo;T9&rdquo; works best with short words, but will have some obvious shortcomings with words it does not know, and also it will not be able to guess at words that have more letters than those entered. A user must thus have used the system extensively without having to resort to the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; key. By using the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; key each time the system guesses wrong means that the input of text cannot possibly be particularly efficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The proposed solution, according to the invention, is based on the words that are used and according to priority guesses words independent of the length of the word. If the system guesses wrong, the user simply continues with the next letter, and the system can, if necessary, guess again. Combined with the use of operating devices, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which will be easier to use than a conventional keypad for input of text, the solution proposed here clearly has an advantage over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> shows a sliding switch <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> that has five sliding positions Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 and Y5, and five tilting/pressing positions <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> relates to the display <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> which is divided into four horizontal fields F1, F2, F3 and F4. The F4 &ldquo;clear&rdquo; function relates to the pressure point <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and F1 &ldquo;shift&rdquo; relates to the pressure point <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, regardless of the Y-position. The pressure points <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are related to menu bar/command lines F2 and F3, where <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> activates X2 and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> activates X3. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>only the menu bar/command line F3 is shown. It will not always be necessary to show both these fields F1 and F2, as it is easy to switch between them during use. This can, however, be made as an option that the user himself can set according to his level of proficiency. Preferably, but not necessarily, the figures will, in the interest of simplicity, generally show both fields. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the control element is divided into three parts where a first part <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a pressure point <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>&prime;, where a second part <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> has a pressure point <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>&prime;, and where a third part <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has respective pressure points <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>the control element is divided into a first part <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and a second part <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The part <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has four pressure points <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>&Prime;&Prime;. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the control element is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and consists of five separate pressure points, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The control element that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is divided in the same way as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, except that it has a slightly different design as regards appearance. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> shows how a menu/display will work or look when another type of switch that is rotatable, like the switch shown and described in connection with earlier FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is used. The switch or control element, here indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, has a total of five depression points <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. In this case, the rotation of the control element <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> will replace the sliding positions shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, the rotation providing navigation in the Y-direction with regard to the fields F2 and F3. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>only the field F3 is shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the control element or switch consists of an outer rotatable part <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and a fixed, non-rotatable central part <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. This solution is expedient when it is desirable to have a control element or switch that also includes the possibility of free cursor control, a so-called mouse function. This possibility is also provided by allowing the pressure point <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to include a possibility for free cursor control or mouse function. Reference is also made in this connection to that shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> shows a rotatable switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> in addition to two ordinary pressure switches <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> which are also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> being not only rotatable but can also be depressed in the centre and can be tilted to the right and the left. The switches <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> will control the fixed functions F1 and F4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows how a control element of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is intended to work in connection with showing functions on a display. By way of example, it may be imagined that a number is to be keyed in order to make a call from a telephone. Here, there may be, for example, two main menus that it is possible to switch between by using F1. The F1 and F4 fields (&ldquo;shift&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear&rdquo;) will always be accessible, irrespective of the Y-position the user is in. In a solution of this kind, it will, for example, be possible to key in a number like the number 22 98 88 92 by using the same technique per se as that shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. By, for instance, pressing on the control element or the switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at the position <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, it is possible to select a subsequent menu or command line where by selecting pressure point <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> it is possible to initiate the dialling of the number entered. The device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> operates according to exactly the same principle, the only difference being that the depression points are selected in a slightly different manner. When a connection has been established, the menu bar will change appearance, so that it is, for example, possible to select the adjustment of volume. If the volume is to be adjusted, this can be done whilst the connection is present without having to break it. Furthermore, the said &ldquo;clear&rdquo; function can switch to an &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; option during a call and connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> However, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will now be described in more detail in connection with the other <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. A sliding switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has been chosen here, and it can be seen that by pressing on the control element or switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at the pressure point <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, a marked action bar will be altered to enable entry into a menu, and by depressing the centre point <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> a menu selection, for example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>,-is obtained, where it is possible to choose between SMS messages, settings and addresses. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows how letters can be divided into groups. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>indicates how the switch or control element <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be moved into the Y-position Y3 where the letters at the end of the alphabet are shown in groups of three. Selection of the group stu by depressing the switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at the pressure point <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, i.e., at X1, will cause the letters to spread out as follows: s1, position X1; t, position X2, u, position X3. By pressing in the associated positions, it will be possible to select the letter required, so that, for example, on depression at the pressure point <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, the letter s is selected. To select upper-case letters, it is necessary to hold the position in a little longer, i.e., a &ldquo;long&rdquo; depression, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows how it is possible to generate more letters and symbols. In this case, the switch or control element <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has five Y-positions, i.e., Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 and Y5. At position Y1, there may, for example, be located a command line for further options, here indicated by X1 for numbers, X2 for symbols and X3 for language. In the illustrated case, symbols are chosen by depression of the switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Grouping and splitting of these prior to selection can be effected in a way previously shown. In order to exit the function, the switch must be pressed at the pressure point <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;shift&rdquo;), thereby switching the command line from F3 to F2, which gives options, here shown by a &ldquo;back&rdquo; function at position X3, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, whereby it is possible to return to the main menu or the display as shown as the starting point in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, i.e., that can now be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>The initiation of the &ldquo;back&rdquo; function is effected by depressing the switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at depression point <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> indicates in a block diagram the means which in the main are included in the system according to the invention. Block <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> indicates a display panel (&ldquo;Display&rdquo;) that communicates with a microprocessor <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> (&mgr;P) The microprocessor <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> has either a one-way or two-way connection to an operating device (MD) <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> which may be of any one of the types referred to in this description and shown in the drawings. An auxiliary unit <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> (AUX) can be connected to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> and represent, for example, a wireless transmitter or other functional equipment, as discussed in the introductory portion of the description and the preamble of the independent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference> shows the system according to the invention in connection with the use of a switch or a control element <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> that rotates and has five depression points <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows all these pressure points. The positions will be located at the same fixed points, even when the switch <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is rotated. In this case, an active command line F3 is shown on the display <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. It will be seen that the display has the same design as that used with the first switch type, i.e., the sliding switch. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>show the keying-in of a telephone number, where in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>it will be seen that only the command line F3 taken from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be the active command line and will be shown. The keying-in, for example, of the telephone number 22 98 88 90 will be effected partly by depression of selected depression points on the switch <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> and partly by the turning of the switch, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>Once keying-in is completed, the user chooses to switch command line, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, it is shown how new options thus appear on the command line, corresponding to the command line F2 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. It will also be noted how the function F4 (&ldquo;clear&rdquo;) has changed function. This is because in connection with certain functions it will be expedient to have other commands. It will also be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>how the menu bar/command line has changed function when the number is connected to the recipient. Here the options &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; are shown. In the envisaged case, &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; can switch between several incoming calls. In this case &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; is shown as a function to produce, for example, volume adjustment, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference><highlight><italic>k. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

The depressible switches <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> control the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;shift&rdquo; functions respectively, whilst the rolling and tilting switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> handles the functions F2 and F3. The switches <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> will replace the pressure positions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the pressure positions <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in connection with the switch design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> will operate with the switch/command fields F2 and F3. By rotating the switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, the user will be able to choose from a menu as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>or continue looking through a menu or list/row of numbers, letters, symbols and the like in the fields F2 and F3. By pressing the switch <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> it will be possible to switch between the fields F2 and F3. In addition, it will be seen that the presentation on the display <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is similar to that shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>shows the selection of upper-case letters by holding the switch <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> depressed at the point <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>&prime; a little longer, a so-called long &ldquo;click&rdquo;. </paragraph>

The switch <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> controls functions such as &ldquo;clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo;. In the illustrated example, the system according to the invention will not have two main menus, but the user will have to go to a menu bar by rotating the switch <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, see, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>. In reality, the switches <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> together have a function like a previously described sliding switch or rotary switch that has four possible points of depression, the switch <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> having a possible point of depression at the centre point <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>&prime;, at a first end point <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>&Prime; and at a second end point <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, in addition to the fourth pressure point represented by the switch <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The illustrated example indicates the keying-in of a telephone number, in the chosen example, the telephone number 22 98 88 92. The input can be carried out following the same pattern as previously described in connection with the other figures described. Of course, the same also applies to the input of letters. In the illustrated solution only one menu bar/command line has been shown. By rotating the switch <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, the user can rotate to options and confirm selection by pressing the switch at one of the said pressure points <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>&Prime; or <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The options that are given in the example, but which should in no way be understood as defining the limits of the invention, can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The menu shown in this figure is only given as an example to illustrate normal functions in a functional apparatus in which the solution according to the invention may be integrated. By selecting &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; the user brings up additional functions which he can choose between by moving a cursor <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference><highlight><italic>p</italic></highlight>, by rotating the switch <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;On&rdquo;, &ldquo;clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; will be accessible at all times by means of a &ldquo;long&rdquo; depression at position X1 (on/yes), X2 (clear) and X3 (off). A &ldquo;long&rdquo; depression or &ldquo;click&rdquo; is created in that the is signals are controlled via a microprocessor which takes the time of or measures the volume of the impulse. In certain functions, the screen <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> will show options which are only of interest in certain cases, as for instance the adjustment of volume during a conversation, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference><highlight><italic>o</italic></highlight>. Clearly, it will also be understood that in the systems shown and explained in this document it will also be possible to use existing push-button keypads with only moderate modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>l </italic></highlight>will serve to illustrate how it is possible to use a keypad that is conventional per se in order to perform the tasks that have been shown to be performable using a sliding switch, a rotary switch or a combination of a rotatable/tiltable/depressible switch and optionally using one or two auxiliary depression switches. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> has been included to show the possibility of splitting letter and symbol groups. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a system where the primary information is shown on the keys themselves (for example, by silk screen printing). The display shows two lines that reflect two of the options in the Y-direction. DY1 shows options in the Y-direction and DY2 shows the main menu. As can be seen from, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, it is possible to bring up additional options for the switches other than those with which they are marked. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>shows further option alternatives that it is possible to fetch by using, for instance arrow keys. Here, the option is shown on the switches themselves, whilst only one of these will be shown on the screen. By means of a mapping system as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</cross-reference>, it is quite conceivable that marking on the switches themselves or of a key area will be able to change during use. By going into a menu or another list of options, the user will be able to navigate a cursor across a screen by using arrow keys in a known way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>o </italic></highlight>show the input of letters in connection with the facility for setting up a text message. In this case, by pressing the key 1/ABC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>, it will be possible to display a splitting of the field DY1. Then, by pressing the key 3/GHI, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, the user will produce the letter C. Similarly, to produce the letter O, the user will first press on the key 5/MNO and then on the key 6/PQR. Similar operations are carried out as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>l</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference> shows how it is possible to use a system having a keypad which in itself changes characters, numbers, letter or symbols according to what is necessary at any given time in order to make the right entries and initiate the tasks that an apparatus in which the is invention is used is to perform. In the example illustrated in this figure, the apparatus in which the invention is intended to be used has by way of example has a screen <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of relatively minimal size. Thus, the system in this case will function in that the keypad itself functions in effect as a screen, i.e., it shows options, but not the results thereof This can be done in that each key in the keypad is itself a small screen, or that the whole of the key area has a touch screen. Such touch screens are commonly known art, and it is also known that such touch screens can change appearance, depending on what the screen is to be used for. Another way, of course, would be to use a combination of light and templates which shows numbers/letters/symbols that are relevant at given times. As indicated, an apparatus that uses such a system will not need screen space to show options on the input of data, and will thus manage with a fairly small screen or display <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The input of numbers and letters shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</cross-reference> is effected in the same way as shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</cross-reference>. By making use of the switches that are generally intended to be used and that are described in the present application, it is possible, as already mentioned, to control all or most of the functions that are associated with hand-held electronic apparatus. Although a wide range of other applications are of course possible, in the interest of simplicity the present invention is related in most examples to the control of a mobile telephone. This should in no way be understood as defining the limits of the present invention. Examples will also be given in the description to show how an adapted menu system can make use of sliding and rotary switches to determine the functions of an apparatus, such as a mini-computer or a so-called PDA.

The sliding switch, here indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, has five sliding positions and four pressure points, where the pressure points are indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. The pressure points <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> correspond to the coordinates X1, X2 and X3. The pressure point <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> will have a general (global) function. The input of letters, numbers and symbols is effected in the same way as taught earlier, but here it is possible to show several alternatives directly on the screen. The alternatives shown, which are simply indicated here by examples, are telephone <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, contacts <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, diary/planner <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, Internet <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, PC function <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, e-mail <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, connections, optionally wireless, <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, calculators <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, notebook <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, MP3/on-line music <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, TV <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and radio <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The menu in this case is illustrated by icons that reflect the most common functions in functional equipment of this kind. A frame <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> can be moved down a list of stored telephone numbers. By moving the switch <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> in the Y-direction, the user can, by pressing on the switch <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, choose one of three digits in the X-direction. The switch <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> has pressure positions <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. The application of pressure at pressure point <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> will cause the function &ldquo;back&rdquo; to be activated, i.e., it is possible to return to the screen image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By moving the switch down to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the user can continue to browse through the list. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>shows how the screen image can change if the user is connected to a telephone number, here shown by the option for adjusting volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference> shows how its is possible to set up a system where the user has a list of all his contacts. Moving the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to switch position Y4 and choosing X2 by pressing the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> down at pressure point <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>, causes the list of contacts, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, to be divided into private X1, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>, emergency X2, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and business contacts X3, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The depression of the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> will result in a list of private contacts appearing on the display, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> has been pushed up to the top position, position Y5, and position X1 &ldquo;wife&rdquo; is selected by depressing the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> at the pressure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Here, &ldquo;all&rdquo; data about that person&apos;s work and private situation can be stored and retrieved. In the illustrated example the data are divided into &ldquo;home&rdquo;, &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;mobile&rdquo;. In this case &ldquo;Work&rdquo; is selected by depressing the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>shows how data under this definition can in turn be divided up. Here, a direct connection, i.e., direct dialling, is chosen by depressing the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> on the pressure point <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. A display image then appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. By pressing the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> again at pressure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a telephone connection can be established. </paragraph>

Here, it will be seen that the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is in the position Y4, and with depression of the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> on pressure point <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Letter groups thus appear in the left-hand field, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Here, position Y4, X3 is chosen with the aid of the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> which is depressed at pressure point <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> when the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is in position Y4. The letter group GHI will thus be split up and shown in a right-hand field <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Pressing on the switch either in pressure point <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, will cause one of the three letters to be selected. If the letter H is to be selected, the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> must be depressed at pressure point <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>, whereby the letter H is generated on the screen. Input of additional letters in the desired text is effected in the same way as described earlier, so that, for example, the word &ldquo;hello&rdquo;, and any additional text is set out on the screen <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. It is noted that the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; function will always be present at pressure point <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> during input. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is pushed into position Y5, and X1, i.e., pressure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, is selected in order to send a message, the field indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> being marked as indicated. Confirmation of address appears as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and can be selected or corrected. It is also possible to select copy to one or more other recipients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The system is based on the same principles also when the user looks through documents and when operating various programs. The system can thus to some extent be compared with the applicant&apos;s interactive system using a similar switch mounted, for example, on the steering wheel of a car. It will also be appreciated that the system taught and described in connection with a car can be directly transferred to a mini computer, if, for example, two multi-function switches are mounted on the apparatus. The sliding switches that are shown may have more or fewer gliding positions. The same switch can also have so-called &ldquo;toggle&rdquo; positions, as described earlier, and this will then be a position that is not fixed. The position can be assigned to one or both ends of the Y axis. It will be expedient to program this position to control, for example, the &ldquo;shift&rdquo; command in order to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; forward in menus or switch between functions and/or options. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference> shows how it is possible to operate a system as shown in preceding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58, 59</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, whilst here a rotatable switch with four depression points is used. It will be understood that the rotatable function of the switch replaces the sliding function of a sliding switch, and that in some cases it will not be necessary to install arrow functions to move up and down a list. The multifunction switch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Pressing the switch at position <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, i.e., position X1, causes input of a text for a text message to be selected. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows how it would be possible to move a cursor <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in a text field <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with X/Y navigation by rotating the switch <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Here, it will be seen that a &ldquo;shift&rdquo; function has been added. This is at the same point as &ldquo;clear&rdquo;, i.e., a pressure point at a position as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. By means of, for example, a short depression it is possible to switch between navigation by rotation in a menu field and a writing field. By means of a prolonged depression the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; function can be operated in the write mode at the same time as it is possible to return to navigation by rotation in the menu field. Switching between X navigation and Y navigation in the text field can quite simply be effected in that the user alternates between them using short presses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference> shows an example of a mini-computer/PDA with a rotatable switch <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that has four depression points indicated by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. There is also a free pointer function switch <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. The pointer function switch <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> may be mounted in the centre of the switch <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are be a fixed function of the switch. In this connection reference is made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> an <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The menu field shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The menu field also has functions associated with arrows <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to be able to move to further menu options, or to be able to return to the starting point. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows that by turning the switch <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, the fields shown in the menu field in the Y-position will successively be highlighted. In the chosen example, Y4 is selected and the switch <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is pressed down at pressure point <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, i.e., position Y4,X3, whereby Internet is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The pointing function can be made active in connection with the functions where this is expedient, such as the Internet. A pointer, here shown in the form of an arrow <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, will be visible on the screen <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. This can be used on the screen image in question for the function. It will be possible to use the pointer in a known way on &plus; and &minus; icons to enlarge or reduce and thus use the whole screen area for the function. However, this is not shown in any detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The pressure position as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will at all times have an overriding function as on/off in addition to the selected function, i.e., &ldquo;clear&rdquo; in the write mode, &ldquo;shift&rdquo; in the pointing mode where it is desirable to switch between control of the various sections of the screen. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>show how the use of the switch <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> reflects the input of letters in the system for web addresses. When the page required comes up, the user can by means of the pointer function click on the icon in order to scroll the page up or down to activate the rotation of the switch to control the manoeuvring. Any selection of input of text on the page will result in the system being taken back to a write mode where the input of text is effected in the way already described several times in the present description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The switch shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will also be capable of functioning in a similar way with a centre-implemented pointer function as represented by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference> shows a sliding switch mounted on a mini-computer, where the sliding switch in the chosen example has five sliding positions and five pressure points. The sliding switch is indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and the pressure points are indicated by the respective reference numerals <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The switch system for the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is based on that shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42, 45</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These figures show a system where there are two global main functions represented by the pressure points <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The pressure point <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> will control main functions like &ldquo;off&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;back&rdquo;. The pressure point <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> will control functions like &ldquo;next&rdquo;, &ldquo;shift&rdquo; etc. When an apparatus in which the invention is present is switched off, this function can also act as an on-switch, i.e., as switch &ldquo;on&rdquo; indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>it is shown that PC functions as indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are selected, related to the switch position Y4X2. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows an example of a menu of main functions, where the said PC function is marked and thus selected. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows how the selected PC function can be divided into, for example, programs <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, documents <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, pictures <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, setting <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, search <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, help <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and run <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that these are only examples and should not be understood as exhaustive in connection with that described here. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows that the switch has been moved to position Y5, and coordinate X2 is selected there, i.e., the position <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for documents. In this case the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> will be depressed at the pressure point <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the pressure point <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is now connected to the function &ldquo;back&rdquo; which means that the user can simply return to the starting point. The pressure point <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is linked to the function &ldquo;next&rdquo; which means that it is possible to obtain additional options in the displayed menu, if such exist. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>shows a list of directories, and where Dir 1 in the illustrated example is selected. The content of Dir 1, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to which reference is made, discloses folders connected to private <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and work <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The folder &ldquo;Priv&rdquo; <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is selected by using the depression point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, this results in an additional juxtaposed image on the screen where the documents Dc1, Dc2, Dc3, Lt1, Lt2, Lt3 are shown. In the chosen example the document Lt2 is selected and opened by a central depression of the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. During the whole operation the user can by means of the pressure points <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> move back and forth between the options &ldquo;next&rdquo; and &ldquo;back&rdquo;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>shows an opened file which in this case is shown as a character document. In this case, there will be an opened document in the program in question for further word processing. The word processing can be done by manipulating the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, as already shown and described in connection with the various exemplary embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, it will now be described how it is possible to use the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for input of text and editing of a document. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, positions Y5X1 and Y5X3 will control the X-direction of cursor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. Position Y5X3 will control the Y-direction of the cursor/line. The direction is changed by pressing on pressure point <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on the switch. When the cursor is at the desired place, input of letters, numbers, and/or symbols is effected in the described manner by using the switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> in one or more of the positions Y2, Y3 and Y4. For additional letters, numbers and/or symbols and possibly functions, the switch is moved to position Y1X1. Spaces in the text are provided by using the position Y1X2. By using combinations of &ldquo;long&rdquo; clicks and &ldquo;short&rdquo; clicks&rdquo; it is possible to make double functions for the pressure points <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. For example, it may be expedient to assign the functions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>in position Y4 to a &ldquo;long&rdquo; click on the pressure point <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;Long&rdquo; clicks are made in that the signals are controlled via a microprocessor that takes the time or measures the volume of the impulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> By integrating a pointer control in the switch, it will be possible to control a pointer and a cursor on the screen. By allowing the pressure point <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to control a &ldquo;shift&rdquo; function, it is possible to switch between allowing the switch to function as a pointer control and as an input means as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>show rotary switch <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> with five pressure positions <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight>. This rotary switch will function according to the same principles and will also control the menu display according to the same principles as described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference>. The rotation function will control navigation in the Y-direction in a similar way as for up and down movement of the sliding switch <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Many of today&apos;s mini-computers/PDAs/multicommunicators (mobile telephones) employ a system involving the use of a touch-sensitive screen, a so-called touch screen. Usually, the screen is accompanied by a &ldquo;pen&rdquo; which the user points and writes with directly on the screen. However, this technology requires the use of two hands or somewhere to put the apparatus whilst it is in use. This will not be necessary, however, with the use of the systems that are described in the present patent specification. It will be understood immediately that the touch screen technology can easily be combined with the technical solutions described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference> shows examples of menus/displays when using a multifunction switch with, for example, four Y-positions and three X options, as can also be seen, for example, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference> is intended for use in connection with a remote control unit, although this should not be understood as limiting for the present invention. The remote control can in a known way transfer signals via a cable or wirelessly, for example, using infra-red technology or ultrasound or via a radio connection (blue tooth) to the apparatus that is to be controlled. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows an example of a main menu, but should not be understood as defining the limits of the present invention. However, a main menu of this kind will typically be suitable for a remote control unit for use in the home. In the main menu as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, there are options for television (TV), video (VD), CD player (CD) cassette player (CS), lights (LT) heating (HT), doors (DR) and alarm (AL). Y1X1 and Y1X3 are positions for obtaining additional options in the menu. As shown, Y1X2 will function as an on/off switch in a start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the selection of CD player (CD) by depressing the multifunction switch <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. This represents the position Y3X1. The functions for control of the CD player will then be displayed on the display screen <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Here, the selection of position Y1X2 (back) will take the user back to the main menu. The system is intended to function so that it is possible to have on and control several functions. If, for example, the user is playing music in the CD mode, he should be able to exit the CD menu in order to operate other functions without the previously started function stopping as a result. In this connection, reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>where light (LT, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, position Y3X3) has been selected. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows the room options such as living room (LR), kitchen (KC), bathroom (BR), bedrooms (B1, B2), entry (ET), cellar (CL), hall (HL) and garage (GR). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows the actual room selected where X1 causes dimming of the lighting when the switch <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is pressed down at pressure point <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, whilst X3 on depression at pressure point <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> causes the lighting to be increased. Y2X2, Y3X2 and Y4X2 indicate which lamps in the room are to be controlled. For instance, C can represent ceiling lamps, W can represent wall lamps and F can represent standard or floor lamps. It is, of course, possible to depart from a division of rooms and lamps and equip the remote control with a sensor that registers which room it is in. Another solution would be to equip all lamps with their own receiver, which means that when controlling the lighting the remote control unit must be pointed in a particular direction to be able to control the required light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference> shows an example of a menu/display for the use of a multifunction switch which has, for example, five Y-positions and three X options. Here too, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>, the multifunction switch, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> in this figure, is intended to be used in connection with a remote control unit <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. As described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65, a</cross-reference> remote control unit can be used to control apparatus and functions wirelessly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference> shows an alternative layout of the screen image for the remote control unit. The depression positions <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> correspond to field F1 (Y1) on the remote control unit. Pressure point <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> has a global function such as &ldquo;Select&rdquo;, &ldquo;OK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; (in the write mode) etc., which corresponds to field F2 that switches between various main functions. The choice of apparatus or functions to choose between is in reality restricted only by the limitations of the imagination of the skilled person. By selecting, for example, pressure point <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, it will be possible to move down the menu list by activating the function &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. By way of example, &ldquo;Heat&rdquo;, which in this case represents the adjustment of heating, is selected in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Pressing down on the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>, causes this adjustment of heating to be selected, whereupon a list of the rooms where it may be relevant to adjust the heating appears, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows chosen rooms such as living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom I etc. Here, it is possible, if so desired, to move on in the menu to fetch more room alternatives. It is also conceivable that the remote control unit itself can find out which room it is in and adapts the choices that will thus be made to that room, as for instance shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference> shows how it is possible to control, for example, a television set by using the system solutions that the invention provides. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the selection of television by pushing the switch into position Y5 and choosing &ldquo;Select&rdquo; by applying pressure at pressure point <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. This will give a signal to the television to connect to the active position. At Y5 volume can be controlled by pressing on the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> at pressure point <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>, depending on whether the volume is to be decreased or increased. An additional option of sound can be placed at pressure point <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. The channel selection is shown by the selection of Y4, i.e., the switch <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is moved down a notch from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, i.e., to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Here, it is possible to select channels by continuing to look though the options by depressing either pressure point <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> or pressure point <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>, or optionally choosing pressure point <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to enter a new menu of channel options which will then be shown on the display <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. A program may also be selected for searching for or tuning in new channels. In connection with the function and control of a television, the functions controlled can be shown directly on the television screen, as is often usual today, or the whole screen image from the remote control unit can be shown directly on the television screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the remote control unit can effect the control of a large number of apparatus and functions by means of the interplay between switch and display. By using the solution described, it is possible to customise the remote control system as desired. This can be done, for example, by choosing between or combining the switch solutions with menu and display systems that have been disclosed and illustrated previously and which must be considered the most expedient. In connection with the invention, it should also be pointed out that all the apparatus that can be controlled by means of the various switch and menu combinations will also be able to have a function that allows the user to program the positions at which the various functions are to be located. For instance, in a remote control unit it would be possible to make a personal priority list of main functions. As an example, a person for whom it is not natural to have TV as the first option could for instance have radio as first available option. The same could also apply to the positions chosen for &plus; and &minus;, and the field F2. Here, the user will have the opportunity to program the unit according to whether he would like the field F2 to be controlled by pressure point <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows an alternative system which makes use of a rotatable switch <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that has four depression points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. There is also a central cursor controller that is freely mounted in the centre of the switch and indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. In reality, this cursor controller operates like a computer mouse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the alphabet as laid out on a conventional keyboard, q w e r t y, in a menu field <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> which expediently lies within the actual writing field <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. A cursor field <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> corresponds to the depression positions on the switch <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, i.e., the depression positions <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the letters q, a and z correspond to the depression positions or pressure points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. On rotation of the switch <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, the cursor field <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> will be moved to the group of letters it is desirable to use, i.e., in the X-direction. In all positions the application of pressure at pressure point <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> in this mode will function as &ldquo;space&rdquo; when writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Menu fields can be switched by using a &ldquo;long&rdquo; click or depression at the pressure point <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, so that, for example, a new menu <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>&prime; appears, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Here, there will be additional options. In position <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference> it will be possible to navigate the text cursor <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> freely by using all of the four available positions or pressure points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. In position <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> it will be possible to browse page by page in the same way (page up/page down/home/end). The cursor field <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> will also have three corresponding options by using the pressure points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> on the switch <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. In the end positions, see position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for the field <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and similarly position <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the field <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, it will be possible by pressing on pressure point <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>(X) to close the whole menu field, thereby causing the whole screen to be free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The design with regard to the menu field should by no means be understood as limiting, as what is important in this connection is that any layout of menu field or the like should at all times be reflected by the options and positions on the multifunction switch used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The centre button <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is a pure cursor control device that can be navigated freely across the screen. By touching the centre button the user can move the cursor which may be as shown by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, or optionally have the appearance of an arrow or another suitable shape. When a selected position has been found, the button <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> can be released and initiate the selection. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>the reference numeral <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> denotes &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; and the reference numeral <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> denotes &ldquo;Back&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clear&rdquo;. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> indicates, for example, line shift. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>the indicated arrow directions, i.e., to the left, the right, up and down, will be related to respective pressure points <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference>, whereby it will be possible to effect navigation of the text cursor. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the cursor field has been moved one step to the right from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and there will then be four indications H (Home) top P (Page up) and bottom P (Page down). It will thus be understood that the present invention provides enormous potential for fast and simple navigation in a menu image and allows editing to be carried out as required. </paragraph>
