<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Up to now, an example of utilizing a communication network (intranet, Internet and extranet) under a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) environment is known as a market research (properly, written as a &ldquo;market research&rdquo; or abbreviated as MR) through a two-way computer communication network of this kind. For example, there is publicly known such a market research that an administrator of a banner advertisement with a quiz offering a prize collects the address, name, electronic mail address and the like inputted by a reader of the banner advertisement into a home page and utilizes such information (personal attribute information) as answers to the quiz and the like. Such a market research is domestically performed in general. In other words, such a market research is performed in one language. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Recent commercial distribution to be the subject of a market research is expanded either inside or outside a country. That is to say, commodity purchase through mail order from foreign countries (for example, personal imports) and the like are active, and for an efficient sale or service offer, an international market research has been needed. In such an international market research, information of a market research performed in a country is often obtained in another country and translated and then utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an international market research has a problem that it takes a long time for acquisition and translation of information, makes it difficult to quickly obtain market information and hinders an effective market development. As such translation utilizing a two-way computer communication network (intranet, Internet and extranet), there is an example of building a Web site in each language of many languages and making each Web server perform a translation process of a language. This example brings the enlargement of processing scale and apparatus scale. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Next, embodiments of a method for performing a multilingual market research through a two-way computer communication network, and a communication system and information recording medium for the same method are described in detail with reference to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the structure of an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this example is a two-way computer communication network under a TCP/IP environment, and shows a rough composition example of an extranet in which the Internet of each country (including areas also) of plural countries is connected to the Internet of another country. In this example extranet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> for example, a multilingual market research (MR) Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for performing a multilingual market research and a plurality of multilingual user apparatuses <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for performing a multilingual translation and market research are connected to a digital wire communication network <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (ISDN: Integrated Services Digital Network) as the Internet built in Japan (country A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A market research in many languages in this case means a market research to an area where a specific language in many languages is in use or to users of this specific language. Therefore, answers to a market research are not necessarily written in the said language. Translation of answers to the market research is translation into a language required by a requester side. Further, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> a report to the requester side also results in being a report written in a language specified by the requester side instead of a report written in a language of the area where the market research has been performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Further, a plurality of multilingual market research (MR) requester apparatuses <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for requesting a multilingual market research of the multilingual market research Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side and a net-black apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for performing a net settlement (electronic commercial transaction) of a charge for a market research in many languages are connected to a digital wire communication network <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this example. A multilingual market research Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is installed in a company which performs a multilingual market research, and a multilingual user apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is installed in the site of a company or person to be an object (answerer) of a multilingual market research. Further, a multilingual market research requester apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is installed in the site of a company or person to request a multilingual market research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Charges to be an object of net settlement include a charge for a multilingual market research which the multilingual market research requester apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> side has requested of the multilingual market research Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a reward for an answer to the market research which the multilingual market research Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side has requested of a multilingual user apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As such a reward for an answer, there are various kinds of rewards including a gift certificate and the like among countries, and is described in detail after this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, in the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, networks built in the respective countries (country A, country B and country C) are connected with one another through a gateway (GW) apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A network built in each of the countries B and C has the same configuration as the configuration from the digital wire communication network <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the net-bank apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and detailed illustration of it is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The digital wire communication network <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is well known in composition and transmission method as ISDN, and is of a network configuration in which a digital exchange (PBX) is installed in a transmission circuit network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this example, a UNIX workstation is used as the multilingual market research Web site apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and a general-purpose small computer is used by an answerer in a multilingual market research as the multilingual user apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In ease that an answerer in a multilingual market research is a company or the like, a UNIX workstation system may be used.
