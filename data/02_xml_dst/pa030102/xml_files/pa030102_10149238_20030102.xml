<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a medicament dispenser including a medicament container having a dispensing mechanism actuable by an actuator. The dispenser is particularly suitable for use as an inhalation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known to treat patients with medicaments contained in an aerosol, for example, in the treatment of respiratory disorders. It is also known to use for such treatment, medicaments which are contained in an aerosol and are administered to a patient by means of an inhalation device comprising a tubular housing or sleeve in which the aerosol container is located and an outlet tube leading out of the tubular housing. Such inhalation devices are generally referred to as metered dose inhalers (MDIs). The aerosol containers used in such inhalation devices are designed to deliver a predetermined dose of medicament upon each actuation by means of an outlet valve member at one end which can be opened either by depressing the valve member while the container is held stationary or by depressing the container while the valve member is held stationary. In the use of such devices, the aerosol container is placed in the tubular housing with the outlet valve member of the container communicating via a support with the outlet tube, for example a nozzle or mouthpiece. When used for dispensing medicaments, for example in bronchodilation therapy, the patient then holds the housing in a more or less upright condition and the mouthpiece or nozzle of the inhalation device is placed in the mouth or nose of the patient. The aerosol container is pressed towards the support to dispense a dose of medicament from the container which is then inhaled by the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is also known to use dry powder inhalation devices for the delivery of inhalable medicament. In one aspect, such dispensers comprise pre-metered doses of powdered medicament, for example in capsules or blisters. In another aspect, such dispensers comprise a reservoir of powdered medicament from which doses are metered prior to or concurrent with the delivery process. In either case, the device may be designed for passive release of medicament, where the medicament is simply made available at a delivery position for aerosolisation in response to the inhalation of the patient. Alternatively, an active release mechanism may be used whereby a &lsquo;puff&rsquo; of gas or air is provided to the delivery position to assist in aerosolisation of the powder prior to or concurrent with the inhalation of the patient. Such devices are generally called active release dry powder inhalers (active DPIs). The source of the compressed gas or air is generally an aerosol container but can also be provided by another suitable means such as a pump or plunger mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also well known to use syringes for the delivery of injectable medicament to a patient. Traditional syringes rely on puncturing of the patient&apos;s skin by a hollow needle through which the injectable medicament (in solution or suspension form) is delivered to the muscle or tissue of the patient. Recently developed needleless systems for the delivery of injectables employ high velocity injection of particle formulated drugs or vaccine through the skin and into any physically accessible tissue. Other needleless systems employ similar high velocity injection of drug or vaccine coated on to a suitable carrier particle. Such needleless systems may be configured to include a source of compressed air or gas, which on release provides energy to propel the medicament particles for injection into the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It may be understood that effective delivery of medicament to the patient using an inhalation device such as an MDI or active DPI as described above is to an extent dependent on the patient&apos;s ability to manually actuate the device (e.g. firing of the aerosol) and to co-ordinate the actuation thereof with the taking of a sufficiently strong inward breath. For some patients, particularly young children, the elderly and the arthritic, manual actuation of the device can present difficulties. Other patients find it difficult to co-ordinate the taking of a reliable inward breath with actuation of the device. Both of these sets of patients run the risk that they do not receive the appropriate dose of medicament. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It may also be understood that effective delivery of medicament to the patient using a syringe or needleless injection system as described above also requires care and dexterity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The Applicants have now developed a medicament dispenser which does not require controlled manual actuation by the patient. In one aspect, the dispenser comprises a medicament container having a dispensing mechanism such as a valve or plunger and an actuator for actuating the dispensing mechanism. In another aspect, the device comprises an active DPI or needless injection system having a source of compressed air or gas having a dispensing mechanism such as a valve or plunger and an actuator for actuating the dispensing mechanism. Actuation is responsive to the application of non-mechanical energy to a coupling element of the actuator. The non-mechanical energy can be in the form of heat provided by electrical current flow through the coupling element, which in turn can be provided in response to the sensing of the breath of a patient. Alternatively, the non-mechanical energy can be in the form of a magnetic field provided by a suitable magnetic field source such as a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,914 describes a shape memory alloy micro-actuator. The actuator comprises a nickel-titanium alloy material which undergoes a temperature induced phase transition when heated. The phase transition results in contraction of the actuator. The actuator can be mechanically coupled to a micro-mechanical element for motion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,154 describes alloy materials which undergo a phase transition in response to the application of a magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a medicament dispenser comprising a housing; a medicament container having a dispensing mechanism; a container seat for receipt of the container; an anchor station on the housing or connecting therewith; and a coupling between said container seat and said anchor station capable on deformation of moving the container seat relative to the anchor station to actuate the dispensing mechanism. The coupling is reversibly deformable in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a medicament dispenser comprising a medicament container having a dispensing mechanism; a container seat for receipt of the container; a dispenser seat for receipt of the dispensing mechanism; and a coupling between said container seat and said dispenser seat capable on deformation of moving the container seat relative to the dispenser seat to actuate the dispensing mechanism. The coupling is reversibly deformable in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a medicament dispenser comprising a housing; a medicament container for containing medicament for release; an aerosol container having a dispensing mechanism; a container seat for receipt of the aerosol container; an anchor station on the housing or connecting therewith; and a coupling between said container seat and said anchor station capable on deformation of moving the container seat relative to the anchor station to actuate the dispensing mechanism to energise released medicament, wherein the coupling is reversibly deformable in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a medicament dispenser comprising a medicament container for containing medicament for release; an aerosol container having a dispensing mechanism; a container seat for receipt of the container; a dispenser seat for receipt of the dispensing mechanism; and a coupling between said container seat and said dispenser seat capable on deformation of moving the container seat relative to the dispenser seat to actuate the dispensing mechanism to energise released medicament, wherein the coupling is reversibly deformable in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Suitably, in accord with the two aspects introduced directly above, the medicament container comprises a release mechanism for releasing medicament therefrom, such as a valve or other suitable mechanism which may also provide a metering function. In another aspect, the medicament container may be arranged for rupture in response to firing of the aerosol container, thereby making the medicament contents thereof available for energisation. In one aspect, the medicament dispenser is in the form of an active DPI in which a &lsquo;puff&rsquo; of air or gas (e.g. helium) is delivered from an aerosol container, pump or plunger mechanism to aerosolise a dose of released dry powder medicament. In another aspect, the medicament dispenser is in the form of a needless injection system in which compressed air or gas (e.g. helium) is delivered at high velocity from the aerosol container to propel a dose of dry powder medicament for injection into the skin. Thus, suitably the aerosol container, which as used herein refers to any suitable container for comprising liquefied gas under pressure, comprises a compressed air or gas (e.g. helium). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The release mechanism comprises means for the making medicament available from the medicament container for release to the patient. The release may be active in the sense that medicament is actively dispensed from the container, or the release may be passive in the sense that medicament is merely made available for release when the release means is actuated. Release may be to a delivery position for delivery to the patient, or alternatively there may be a further transport step in which the medicament is transported from a non-delivery, position, to a position where the drug is ready for delivery to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the medicament is pre-metered prior to release. For example, the medicament is pre-metered in capsules, strip or tape form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the medicament container comprises a reservoir for medicament (e.g. in powder form) and a meter is provided for metering an amount (e.g. by volume or by weight) of medicament from said reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Suitably, the dispensing mechanism is selected from the group consisting of a valve, pump or plunger mechanism. Preferably, the dispensing mechanism comprises a metering mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the dispensing mechanism comprises a valve. Suitably, the valve is a slide valve. Other valve systems include, but are not limited to, poppet valve systems, wedge gate valve systems, double-disc gate valve systems, globe and angle valve systems, swing check valve systems, end cock valve systems, and other like valve systems. The valve design is typically a function of providing a predetermined dosage or amount of the medicament contained within the container to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Where the medicament container is a pressurized aerosol container, the valve typically comprises a valve body having an inlet port through which a medicament aerosol formulation may enter said valve body, an outlet port through which the aerosol may exit the valve body and an open/close mechanism by means of which flow through said outlet port is controllable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The valve may be a slide valve wherein the open/close mechanism comprises a sealing ring and receivable by the sealing ring a valve stem having a dispensing passage, the valve stem being slidably movable within the ring from a valve-closed to a valve-open position in which the interior of the valve body is in communication with the exterior of the valve body via the dispensing passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Typically, the valve is a metering valve. The metering volumes are typically from 10 to 100 &mgr;l, such as 25 &mgr;l, 50 &mgr;l or 63 &mgr;l. Suitably, the valve body defines a metering chamber for metering an amount of medicament formulation and an open/close mechanism by means of which the flow through the inlet port to the metering chamber is controllable. Preferably, the valve body has a sampling chamber in communication with the metering chamber via a second inlet port, said inlet port being controllable by means of an open/close mechanism thereby regulating the flow of medicament formulation into the metering chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The valve may also comprise a &lsquo;free flow aerosol valve&rsquo; having a chamber and a valve stem extending into the chamber and movable relative to the chamber between dispensing and non-dispensing positions. The valve stem has a configuration and the chamber has an internal configuration such that a metered volume is defined therebetween and such that during movement between is non-dispensing and dispensing positions the valve stem sequentially: (i) allows free flow of aerosol formulation into the chamber, (ii) defines a closed metered volume for pressurized aerosol formulation between the external surface of the valve stem and internal surface of the chamber, and (iii) moves with the closed metered volume within the chamber without decreasing the volume of the closed metered volume until the metered volume communicates with an outlet passage thereby allowing dispensing of the metered volume of pressurized aerosol formulation. A valve of this type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,085. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The valve may also have a structure and action similar to those aerosol valves described in European Patent Application No. EP-A-870,699 and PCT Patent Application No. WO99/36334. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the dispensing mechanism comprises a plunger, such as might exist in a syringe for the delivery of injectable medicament to a patient. Embodiments including multiple plungers and multiple syringe chambers are also envisaged. The syringe contents may for example, be liquid, solutions, suspensions, particulates or in freeze-dried form. A retract or reset mechanism is typically provided for the plunger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Traditional syringes rely on puncturing of the patient&apos;s skin by a hollow needle through which the injectable medicament (in solution or suspension form) is delivered to the muscle or tissue of the patient. Recently developed needleless systems for the delivery of injectables employ high velocity injection of particle formulated drugs or vaccine through the skin and into any physically accessible tissue. Other needleless systems employ similar high velocity injection of drug or vaccine coated on to a suitable carrier particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the dispensing mechanism comprises a pump mechanism such as might be found in a dispenser for dispensing liquid or solution (e.g. aqueous solution) form medicament. The pump may deliver the medicament directly to the patient (e.g. as a nasal spray) or the pump may deliver the medicament to an intermediate position at which further energy is supplied thereto to further propel, aerosolise or otherwise direct the medicament dose to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A reset mechanism may be provided for resetting the dispensing mechanism after actuation thereof. The reset mechanism may for example, comprise a spring, motor, mechanical arrangement or a reset coupling which is reversibly deformable in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The term &lsquo;non-mechanical energy&rsquo; herein is used to mean essentially any energy type which is not mechanical energy. The coupling and any reset coupling herein typically comprise a material which deforms, or undergoes a phase transition in response to the application of non-mechanical energy, thereby resulting in a change in shape/dimension of the coupling which serves to actuate the dispensing mechanism. In embodiments the energy may be in the form of heat energy, electrical current energy, electrical field energy and magnetic field energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the non-mechanical energy comprises electric current flow through the coupling or reset coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the coupling or reset coupling comprises a wire, strip, coil or tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Arrangements comprising multiple strips, wires, coils, or tubes are also envisaged. The multiple strips, wires, coils, or tubes may be arranged in any suitable fashion including parallel or series arrangements and bundle arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The coupling may be coated with any suitable coating, or encased within any suitable encasing including a shrink-wrap sheath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one particular aspect, the coupling or reset coupling comprises one or more wires which contract in response to application of non-mechanical energy thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the degree of contraction of the coupling is from 2% to 8%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, the coupling comprises an alloy which undergoes a phase transition on heating (shape memory alloys). Certain shape memory alloys also undergo a change in shape on recooling without externally applied energy. Such two way shape memory alloys are also envisaged for use herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the shape memory alloy is preferably a nickel-titanium alloy such as a nickel-titanium alloy comprising from 5% to 95%, preferably from 20% to 80%, nickel by weight and from 95% to 5%, preferably from 80% to 20%, titanium by weight. By nickel-titanium alloy it is meant an alloy comprised essentially of nickel and titanium, although other elements such as Cu and Nb may be present in small (e.g. trace) amounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the shape memory alloy is preferably a copper-aluminum-nickel alloy or a copper-zinc-aluminum alloy. Trace amounts of other elements may also be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In further embodiments, the coupling comprises an alloy which undergoes a phase transition on application of a magnetic field thereto (magnetic shape memory alloys). These materials are generally intermetallic, ferromagnetic alloys that exhibit twin variants in the martensitic, or low-temperature, phase of the material. Suitable magnetic shape memory alloys are for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,154. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the magnetic shape memory alloy exhibits an austenitic crystal structure above a characteristic phase transformation temperature and also exhibits a martensitic twinned crystal structure below the phase transformation temperature. The alloy has a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy that is sufficient to enable motion of twin boundaries of the martensitic twinned crystal structure in response to application of a magnetic field to the martensitic twinned crystal structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Where a magnetic shape memory alloy is employed the medicament dispenser preferably includes a magnetic field source disposed with respect to the coupling in an orientation that applies to the coupling a magnetic actuation field in a direction that is substantially parallel with a selected twin boundary direction of the martensitic twinned crystal structure of the coupling material. </paragraph>

Shahinpoor, Y. Bar-Cohen, J. O. Simpson and J. Smith as published at http://www.unm.edu/&tilde;amri/paper.html. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Other potentially suitable shape memory alloys include those based on contractile polymers such as are described in &lsquo;Review of Artificial Muscle based on Contractile Polymers&rsquo;, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Memo No. 1330, November 1991, David L. Brock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the one or more wires have a diameter from 30 to 400 micrometers, preferably from 50 to 150 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the coupling comprises from two to twenty, preferably six to twleve wires which contract in response to the application of non-mechanical energy thereto. The wires may be arranged in any suitable fashion including parallel or series arrangements and bundle arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the coupling comprises a strip which comprises multiple layers of different metals. Suitable strips typically comprise a plurality of layers of material, each material having a different coefficient of thermal expansion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferred examples of strips include those comprising multiple layers of different metals (e.g. bimetallic strips) and strips comprising at least one piezoelectric material. Suitable piezoelectric materials include piezoelectric ceramics, such as compounds of lead zirconate and lead titanate, and piezoelectric crystals which are generally polycrystalline ferroelectric materials with the perovskite structure. Such piezoelectric materials generally deform in response to the application of an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the coupling is deformable in response to heating arising from electrical current flow in the range from 0.01A to 100A, preferably from 0.1A to 5A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the coupling is deformable in response to the application of an electrical field, particularly where the coupling comprises a piezoelectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the coupling is deformable in response to a magnetic field of from 0.01 to 100 Tesla. The magnetic field may for example, be produced by a permanent magnet or by an electromagnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the medicament dispenser additionally comprises an electrical energy source for providing electric current, or for providing an electric field, or for powering an electromagnet to provide a magnetic field. In one aspect, the electrical energy source comprises a voltaic cell or battery of voltaic cells which may be rechargeable. In another aspect, the electrical energy source comprises a photovoltaic cell or battery of photovoltaic cells. In a further aspect, the electrical energy source comprises a converter for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In a further aspect, the electrical energy source comprises a capacitor for local storage of charge. Suitable capacitors comprise those known as &lsquo;super capacitors&rsquo; with a high capacitance to size ratio, such as those consisting of solid electrodes and liquid electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Any known systems for power management and conservation may be employed with the electrical energy source to manage and/or conserve the power output thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Energy may be conserved by a variety of means to enable the device to operate for longer on a given source of energy, such as a battery. Energy conservation or saving methods have additional advantages in terms of reducing the size requirements of the power source (e.g. battery) and thus the weight and portability of the inhalation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A variety of energy saving methods are available which generally involve reducing power consumption. One such method is to use a clock or timer circuit to switch the power on and off at regular or predetermined intervals. In another method the system can selectively switch on/off specific electronic devices, such as visual display units or sensors, in order to power these devices only when they are required to perform a particular sequence of events. Thus different electronic devices may be switched on and off at varying intervals and for varying periods under control of the system. The power sequencing system may also respond to a sensor, such as a motion or breath sensor, which is activated on use of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Low power or &ldquo;micropower&rdquo; components should be used within the electronics where possible and if a high power device is required for a particular function this should be put into a low power standby mode or switched off when not required. Similar considerations apply in the selection of transducers. Operation at low voltage is desirable since power dissipation generally increases with voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For low power digital applications complementary metal oxide semi-conductor (CMOS) devices are generally preferred and these may be specially selected by screening for low quiescent currents. Clock speeds of processors and other logic circuits should be reduced to the minimum required for computational throughput as power consumption increases with frequency. Supply voltages should also be kept at minimal values consistent with reliable operation because power dissipation in charging internal capacitance&apos;s during switching is proportional to the square of the voltage. Where possible, supply voltages should be approximately the same throughout the circuit to prevent current flowing through input protection circuits. Logic inputs should not be left floating and circuits should be arranged so that power consumption is minimised in the most usual logic output state. Slow logic transitions are undesirable because they can result in relatively large class-A currents flowing. Resistors may be incorporated in the power supply to individual devices in order to minimise current in the event of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In some control applications, devices that switch between on and off states are preferred to those that allow analog (e.g. linear) control because less power is dissipated in low resistance on states and low current off states. Where linear components are used (e.g. certain types of voltage regulators) then types with low quiescent currents should be selected. In some circuit configurations it is preferable to use appropriate reactive components (i.e. inductors and capacitors) to reduce power dissipation in resistive components. Any electrical circuit may incorporate voltage amplification means for generating a higher voltage than that supplied by the voltaic cell or battery of voltaic cells, for example a step-up or inverting switching circuit or a dc-dc converter incorporating an oscillator, transformer and rectifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The electrical circuit may incorporate one or more energy storage components such as capacitors or inductors in order to supply a high enough instantaneous current to raise the temperature of the strips or wires at the required rate to the required temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The input to the electrical circuit may be connected to the electrical energy source by means of a mechanical, electromechanical or electronic switching component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The output of the electrical circuit may be connected to the strips or wires or to an electromagnet by means of a mechanical, electromechanical or electronic switching component or by a component allowing the output current to be controlled in a linear or digital (e.g. pulse width modulated) manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Suitable control profiles (e.g. via pulse width modulation) include those where the temperature of a shape memory alloy coupling is initially raised to a holding temperature (H) which is just below the transition temperature (T). Actuation of the coupling is then achievable by heating the coupling to a temperature (A) just above the transition temperature. This can be achieved rapidly because the holding temperature (H) is close to the transition temperature (T). When the source of heating is switched off, deactuation also occurs rapidly because the cooling from a temperature (A) only just above the transition temperature (T) to the transition temperature involves only a small temperature decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The strip or wire components may be powered from the battery using a switching component without additional power supply circuitry. </paragraph>

Suitable techniques include optical detectors, magnetic detectors or detectors using detection of capacitative effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Optical detectors may be used to detect movement of the breath-movable element by providing the element with a patterned outer surface, for example strips in a barcode type arrangement, and locating the optical detector so that it points towards the patterned surface. Movement of the breath-movable element alters the amount of the light source which reflects back onto the optical detector as the beam passes over the patterned surface. The strips may be arranged so that the direction of movement of the element can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Magnetic detectors may be used to detect the movement of breath-movable element by the use of a magnetic switch device. A reader is located on the dispenser and magnetic material embedded within the breath-movable element (or vice-versa).

Movement of the breath-movable element results in a change in capacitance which can be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the sensor comprises a pressure sensor for sensing the pressure profile associated with the breath of a patient. A pressure transducer is an example of a suitable pressure sensor. </paragraph>

The information could for example, include manufacturing and distribution compliance information written to the memory at various points in the manufacturing or distribution process, thereby providing a detailed and readily accessible product history of the dispenser. Such product history information may, for example, be referred to in the event of a product recall. The compliance information could, for example, include date and time stamps. The information could also include a unique serial number stored in encrypted form or in a password protectable part of the memory which uniquely identifies the product and therefore may assist in the detection and prevention of counterfeiting. The information could also include basic product information such as the nature of the medicament and dosing information, customer information such as the name of the intended customer, and distribution information such as the intended product destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> On loading or reloading the dispenser with a medicament container (such as an aerosol canister or dry powder cassette) the second transceiver may, for example, read the unique serial number, batch code and expiry date of the medicament and any other information on the second transceiver. In this way the nature and concentration of the medicament, together with the number of doses used or remaining within the container, may be determined. This information can be displayed to the patient on a visual display unit. Other information, such as the number of times the dispenser has been reloaded with a medicament container, may also be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Similarly, should the container be removed from the housing before the supply of medicament is exhausted, the same data can be read from the second transceiver and the number of doses remaining or used determined. Other information, such as the date and time of administration of the drug, or environmental exposure data such as the minimum / maximum temperatures or levels of humidity the medicament container has been exposed to, may also be read and displayed to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the event that the supply of medicament within the container becomes exhausted, or that the shelf life of the medicament has expired, or that the first transceiver does not recognise the batch code on the second transceiver, activation of the dispenser may be prevented to safeguard the user. Activation may also be prevented if the medicament has been exposed to extreme environmental conditions for periods out with the manufacturer&apos;s guidelines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Data may be transferred to and from any transceiver during the period of use of the medicament dispenser by the patient. For example, the medicament dispenser may include an electronic data management system having various sensors associated therewith. Any data collected by the sensors or from any data collection system associated with the electronic data management system including a clock or other date/time recorder is transferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Data may be transferred each time the patient uses the device. Or alternatively, data may be stored in a database memory of the electronic data management system and periodically downloaded to any transceiver. In either case, a history of the usage of the device may be built up in the memory of a transceiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment herein, a history of the usage of the medicament dispenser is transferred to the second transceiver on the aerosol container. When the medicament container is exhausted it is exchanged by the patient for a new refill container. At the point of exchange, which will typically occur at the pharmacy, data may be transferred from the exhausted container to the refill and vice-versa. Additionally, usage history data may be read from the refill and transferred to a healthcare data management system for example comprising a network computer system under the control of a healthcare data manager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Methods are envisaged herein whereby the patient is given some sort of reward for returning the refill and making available the data comprised within the second transceiver. Methods are also envisaged herein whereby the healthcare data manager is charged for either receipt of the data from the second transceiver or for its use for commercial purposes. Any rewards or charging may be arranged electronically. The methods may be enabled by distributed or web-based computer network systems in which any collected data is accessible through a hub on the network. The hub may incorporate various security features to ensure patient confidentiality and to allow selective access to information collected dependent upon level of authorisation. The level of user authorisation may be allocated primarily to safeguard patient confidentiality. Beyond this the level of user authorisation may also be allocated on commercial terms with for example broader access to the database being authorised in return for larger commercial payments. </paragraph>

The wires <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comprise a nickel-titanium alloy which contracts in response to the heating effect of the flow of electrical current therethrough. It may thus, be appreciated that when electrical current is passed through the plural lengths of wire <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the container seat <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> will be drawn towards to the anchor positions <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the wires <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contract. Actuation of the valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and dispensing of medicament dose will thereby result. The flow of electrical current is controlled by the control system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, which is itself responsive to inputs from various sensors (not shown) such as a sensor which senses the breath of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In the event of failure of electrical current flow it may be appreciated that the manual actuation button <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> may be manually pushed downwards to actuate the valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The manuation actuation step also results in the closing of switch <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> which records that a dose has been fired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of electronic components for use in a dispenser herein and an electronic control system therefor. The control system is essentially a more sophisticated version of the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> and is suitable, in aspects for use in controlling the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Central controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> receives inputs and/or transmits outputs to each of the respective components. Key components associated with the central controller are clock chip <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and 32 KHz crystal <highlight><bold>479</bold></highlight> and a power supply <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> in the form of a battery. A suitable battery <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> delivers 6 Volts at 1.3 Amps/Hour and is capable of supplying 4.5 Amps. The central controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> communicates with various sensors on the device including a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> for sensing ambient temperature; a breath sensor <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (e.g. in the form of a pressure transducer) for sensing the breath of a patient; a shake sensor <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> for detecting shaking of the device; a Drug ID sensor <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> for reading information from a transceiver on a medicament container to check drug identity and integrity; a manual sensor <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> (e.g. in the form of a switch) for detecting manual actuation of the device; a plume sensor <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> (e.g. in the form an infra red emitter/detector) for detecting firing from the medicament container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Firing circuit <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> for delivery of electrical current to heat shape memory alloy wires (not shown) further communicates with the controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. System clock <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> (e.g. in the form of a crystal or ceramic resonator) enables control over the supply of electrical current to the firing circuit <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows electrical current and temperature profiles herein, although variations may be employed. User interface features comprising an on/off switch <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> and LCD display <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> also communicate with the central controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. External communications interfaces comprising an RS232 interface <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> and infra red interface <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> for data transfer to a docking station or printer are also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that each of the components of the control system may perform an independent function, or that the action of components may be combined to facilitate the working of the system as a whole. An example of a combination action would be sensing of a patient&apos;s inhalation by the breath sensor <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>; communication of that breath sensing to the controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>; communication from the controller <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> to the timing device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> which controls electrical current flow to the firing circuit <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>; the resulting firing of the drug dispenser by; sensing of that firing by the plume sensor <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight>; and a &lsquo;firing complete&rsquo; message displayed to the patient at the LCD Display <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows control of the temperature profile of shape memory alloy wires in a firing operation together with an electrical current profile to achieve that temperature control. The upper plot shows temperature of the shape memory alloy (SMA) temperature versus time (in ms). The lower plot shows the associated electrical current profile versus time (in ms). Focusing initially on the upper plot, the temperature of the SMA wires is initially at a rest temperature (T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) which will be largely determined by the ambient environmental temperature. A pre-heating step then raises the temperature of the SMA wires to a temperature (T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) which is just below (e.g. within 5&deg; C.) the phase transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>) thereof. On actuation, the temperature is raised to an actuation temperature (T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) which is just above (e.g. within 5&deg; C. of) the phase transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>) of the SMA wires causing contraction thereof. The wires are held at this temperature for a holding period. The temperature of the wires is then allowed to cool to below the transition temperature, at which point the wires relax, and ultimately to a rest temperature which is just below (e.g. within 5&deg; C. of) the phase transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>). Focusing now on the lower plot, the electrical current profile to achieve the above temperature profile is shown. The electrical current profile is achievable through the use of pulse wave modulation circuitry. Initially, no current is supplied and the wires remain at the rest temperature (T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). In the pre-heating step, pulses of current are supplied to bring the wires to the holding temperature (T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). During actuation, constant current is initially supplied to raise the rise temperature to the actuation temperature (T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Pulsed current is then supplied to hold the wires at the actuation temperature (T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) until relaxation of the wires is required, at which point the current is switched off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that variations of the temperature and electrical current profiles of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be employed including variation of pre-heating time, actuation time and holding time and release time. In addition, pulse time, repetition rate and amplitude may be varied to give optimal control. </paragraph>

The test apparatus comprises a tubular housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> in which an aerosol container <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is located. The housing is mounted on solid base <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to enable ready placement on a laboratory bench surface. A dispensing outlet <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> leads laterally from the closed end of the housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated, the outlet <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> has a form similar to that of a mouthpiece as would be found on a standard metered dose inhaler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The aerosol container <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> has a valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> in the form of a slide valve. Valve stem <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> connects with a support <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. The support <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> is provided with an outlet passage <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> enabling dispensed dose to pass through to the dispensing outlet <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that dispensing of the dose requires the aerosol container <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to be depressed to actuate the slide valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> and dispense medicament into the outlet <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> It may be seen that the upper part of the aerosol container <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> abuts variable tension screw <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> which forms part of container seat <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. The container seat <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is received within the housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> within track <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> cut into the wall of the housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The container seat <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is provided with a collar <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> comprising a number of wire attachment points <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> (for clarity, not all attachment points are labelled). The lower end of the housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is provided with a similar collar <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> also comprising a number of wire attachment points <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> (again for clarity, not all attachment points are labelled). The collars <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> are arranged to enable the attachment of plural lengths of shape memory alloy wire (not shown) to connect the respective wire attachment points <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> in a coupling arrangement. In alternative embodiments, the plural lengths of wire may comprise a single wire wrapped a number of times around the respective collars (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The wire comprises a nickel-titanium alloy which contracts in response to the flow of electrical current therethrough. It may thus, be appreciated that when electrical current is passed through the plural lengths of wire the collars <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> and hence the container seat <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> will be drawn towards each other as the wire coupling heats up and contracts. Actuation of the valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> and dispensing of medicament dose will thereby result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The container seat <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is coupled through coupling arm <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> to linear displacement transducer <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> (e.g. a linear variable differential transformer) which detects the displacement of the container <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> on actuation. Various other parts of the laboratory test apparatus may optionally be connected to other sensors for monitoring all aspects of the dispensing process.

The inhaler housing <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> comprises a powder metering and transport system comprising a powder reservoir <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>, a metered dose plate <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> having a metering cup <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> and a transport coupling in the form of a nickel-titanium shape memory alloy (SMA) wire assembly <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The inhaler housing <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> further comprises an aerosolisation system comprising an aerosol container <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> having a valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> in the form of a slide valve. The aerosol container <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> comprises a liquefied gas such as liquefied air or carbon dioxide. Valve stem <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> connects with aerosolisation block <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. It may be seen that in the dispensing position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the block <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> communicates with the metering cup <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> such that when a &lsquo;puff&rsquo; of air of gas is released from the aerosol container <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> it will act to aerosolise a metered powder dose in the metering cup <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>. It may be seen that the upper part of the aerosol container <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> is received by container seat <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. The container seat <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> is slidably movable within the housing <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. A second length of shape memory alloy wire <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> connects the container seat <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> to an anchor position <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> on the inhaler housing. The wire <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> comprises a shape memory alloy which contracts in response to the flow of electrical current therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The inhaler is breath operated such that as the patient inhales the power supply <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> (as controlled by an electronic control system, not shown) sends an electrical current through the SMA wire assembly <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>. The SMA wire assembly <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> heats and contracts and draws the metered dose plate <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> containing a metered dose in the metering cup <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> thereof away from the powder reservoir <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to the aerosolisation block <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> for aerosolisation. Electrical current is then passed through the second shape memory alloy wire <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> which contracts such as to draw the container seat <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> towards the anchor position <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. Actuation of the valve dispensing mechanism <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> and aerosolisation of the powder medicament dose thereby results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, the powder metering and transport system and the aerosolisation system may be actuable through a coupled SMA wire assembly. For example, the SMA wire assembly may sequentially actuate metering, transport and aerosolisation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> It may be appreciated that any of the parts of the dispenser or actuator which contact the medicament suspension may be coated with materials such as fluoropolymer materials (e.g. PTFE or FEP) which reduce the tendency of medicament to adhere thereto. Any movable parts may also have coatings applied thereto which enhance their desired movement characteristics. Frictional coatings may therefore be applied to enhance frictional contact and lubricants (e.g. silicone oil) used to reduce frictional contact as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The medicament dispenser of the invention is suitable for dispensing medicament, particularly for the treatment of respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Appropriate medicaments may thus be selected from, for example, analgesics, e.g., codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine; anginal preparations, e.g., diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g., cromoglycate (eg s the sodium salt), ketotifen or nedocromil (eg as the sodium salt); antiinfectives e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g., methapyrilene; anti-inflammatories, e.g., beclomethasone (eg as the dipropionate ester), fluticasone (eg as the propionate ester), flunisolide, budesonide, rofleponide, mometasone eg as the furoate ester); ciclesonide, triamcinolone (eg as the acetonide) or 6&agr;, 9&agr;-difluoro-11&bgr;hydroxy-16&agr;-methyl-3-oxo-17&agr;-propionyloxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17&bgr;-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3-yl) ester; antitussives, e.g., noscapine; bronchodilators, e.g., albuterol (eg as free base or sulphate), salmeterol (eg as xinafoate), ephedrine, adrenaline, fenoterol (eg as hydrobromide), formoterol (eg as fumarate), isoprenaline, metaproterenol, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol (eg as acetate), reproterol (eg as hydrochloride), rimiterol, terbutaline (eg as sulphate), isoetharine, tulobuterol or 4-hydroxy-7-&lsqb;2-&lsqb;&lsqb;2-&lsqb;&lsqb;3-(2-phenylethoxy)propyl&rsqb;sulfonyl&rsqb;ethyl&rsqb;amino&rsqb;ethyl-2(3H)benzothiazolone; adenosine 2a agonists, eg 2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-&lsqb;6-Amino-2-(1S-hydroxymethyl -2-phenyl-ethylamino)-purin-9-yl&rsqb;-5-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-tetrahydro-furan -3,4-diol (e.g. as maleate); &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>integrin inhibitors eg (2S)-3-&lsqb;4-(&lcub;&lsqb;4-(aminocarbonyl) -1-piperidinyl&rsqb;carbonyl&rcub;oxy)phenyl&rsqb;-2-&lsqb;((2S)-4-methyl-2-&lcub;&lsqb;2-(2-methylphenoxy) acetyl&rsqb;amino&rcub;pentanoyl)amino&rsqb; propanoic acid (e.g as free acid or potassium salt), diuretics, e.g., amiloride; anticholinergics, e.g., ipratropium (eg as bromide), tiotropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones, e.g., cortisone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone; xanthines, e.g., aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine theophyllinate or theophylline; therapeutic proteins and peptides, e.g., insulin or glucagon; vaccines, diagnostics, and gene therapies. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the medicaments may be used in the form of salts, (e.g., as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g., lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g., hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability of the medicament. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Medicaments can also be delivered in combinations. Preferred formulations containing combinations of active ingredients contain salbutamol (e.g., as the free base or the sulphate salt) or salmeterol (e.g., as the xinafoate salt) or formoterol (eg as the fumarate salt) in combination with an antiinflammatory steroid such as a beclomethasone ester (e.g., the dipropionate) or a fluticasone ester (e.g., the propionate) or budesonide. A particularly preferred combination is a combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, or a salt thereof (particularly the xinafoate salt). A further combination of particular interest is budesonide and formoterol (e.g. as the fumarate salt). </paragraph>
