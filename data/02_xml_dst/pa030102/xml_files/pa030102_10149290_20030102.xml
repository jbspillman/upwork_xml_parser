</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention thus relates in a further aspect to a process for the preparation of the compound of the formula 2 in which R1 and R2 together are O (oxygen), R3 is cyano (CN) and R4 is hydrogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl, and their salts. The process comprises first alkylating the N-oxide of the compound of the formula 2, in which R1 and R2 together are an ethylenedioxy radical (&mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;O&mdash;), R3 is hydrogen and R4 is hydrogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl, then reacting it with a cyanide and finally working up in a suitable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge which alkylating agents can be employed and under what conditions alkylation must be carried out. Suitable alkylating agents are, for example, dialkyl sulfates (in particular dimethyl sulfate), alkyl halides (in particular methyl iodide) or alkyl tosylates (such as methyl p-toluenesulfonate). The alkylation is carried out in inert solvents (e.g. toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, or ethers, such as diethyl ether) under customary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Suitable cyanides are preferably alkali metal cyanides, in particular sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide. Advantageously, the introduction of the cyano group is performed under catalytic conditions, in particular in the presence of tetrabutylammonium cyanide (TBACN). The reaction is preferably carried out in two-phase systems or in polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The complete conversion of the ketal into the ketone which, if appropriate, is still necessary after introduction of the cyano group is preferably carried out under mild acidic conditions, for example in formic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention further relates to the further reaction of the compounds of the formula 2, in which R1 and R2 together are O (oxygen), R3 is cyano (CN) and R4 is hydrogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl, to give compounds of the formula 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The further reaction consists in a cyclization step to give compounds of the formula 1, in which A, and A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are each hydrogen, to which is added, if desired, an oxidation step to give compounds of the formula 1, in which A, and A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>together are a bonding dash. The cyclization and oxidation step can be illustrated by the following scheme 3:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For cyclization, the compound of the formula 2, in which R1 and R2 together are 0 (oxygen), R3 is cyano (CN) and R4 is hydrogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl, is reacted with a suitable deprotonating agent in an inert solvent. Suitable deprotonating agents which may be mentioned are, for example, alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or in particular potassium tert-butoxide. The oxidation (dehydrogenation) is carried out in a manner likewise known per se to the person skilled in the art using known dehydrogenating agents (such as sulfur or selenium) or in particular using known oxidants, preferably using manganese dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The following examples serve to explain the invention in greater detail without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formulae 1 and 2, whose preparation is not described explicitly, can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in art using customary process techniques. </paragraph>
