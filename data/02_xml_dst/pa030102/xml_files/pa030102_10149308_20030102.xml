<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to supporting structures generally and, more particularly, to a novel suspending supporting structure for supporting substantially rigid linear structures such as pipelines, tramways, walkway bridges, transportation galleries, underwater tunnels, etc placed above a surface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is described in detail with reference to the support of pipelines, it will be understood that it is application as well to the support of other substantially rigid linear structures such as pipelines, tramways, walkway bridges, transportation galleries, underwater tunnels, and etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Design and construction of supports for linear structures such as pipelines, tramways, walkway bridges, transportation galleries, underwater tunnels, etc. placed in complex terrain, or underwater, or in ecologically sensitive areas with long-term recovery of soils destroyed by construction activities, have a long term experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Depending on the linear structure, different types of supports are currently in use. For example, aerial and underwater pipelines are placed mostly in trenches dug in the ground and then backfilled, sleepers placed upon the ground, or tower supports. Tramways and walkway bridges, as well as transportation galleries, are usually supported by towers or by suspended long-span cable systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However all these types of supports have significant drawbacks under the above conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, feasibility and cost effectiveness of placing of the pipelines underground or supporting them by sleepers strongly depends on ground conditions: hardness and roughness of the ground. For many cases of irregular terrain, using these supports is completely impossible Similar restrictions exist for using tower supports Placed across mountainous areas with steep slopes and high peaks, they are ineffective because their heights are significantly higher than the cost effectiveness limits (approx. 100-150 ft). Practically, designers prefer to bypass such areas even though it increases the lengths of the linear structures and accordingly, their costs Both, sleepers and towers are highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as snowfalls, landslides, earthquakes, etc., typical occurrences in mountainous areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The suspended systems are more suitable for complex terrain but they are used rarely The main problem of these structures is that the main carrying cable and the suspended linear structures have low lateral stiffness and are subjected to large displacements and rocking under the lateral loads, mostly wind. To increase the stiffness, traditional suspended systems include special structures such as horizontal frames or a number of horizontally interconnected cables, or the like See U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,604,361 and 3,745,601. As a result, suspended supporting systems usually fail cost competition with sleepers and tower supports </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An effective system of suspended supports for aerial transportation means, such as ski lifts, aerial tramways, freight ropeways, etc is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,655,457. The system described therein includes a long-span cable suspended at its ends and placed along the transportation route A number of spaced apart supports for the aerial means are hung from the cable. Each support has a rigid element supporting the transportation means carried by the cable and guy ropes, one end of which is attached to the rigid element and another end is anchored in the ground and tensioned. The guy ropes carry lateral loads applied to the rigid-elements. No additional structures increasing the lateral stiffness of the system are required. The system is very effective for aerial transportation means; however, for carrying linear structures it has to be essentially modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a suspended supporting system for linear structures such as pipelines, tramways, walkway bridges, transportation galleries, underwater tunnels, etc, providing lateral stability of the structures by segmenting them and thus, decreasing their free spans in horizontal plane. The most effective areas of application of the system are complex terrain and underwater conditions, as well as ecologically sensitive areas with long-term recovery of soils destroyed by construction activities </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The major goal of this invention is the development of a suspended supporting system for substantially rigid linear structures such as pipelines, tramways, walkway bridges, transportation galleries, underwater tunnels, etc. which provides lateral stability of the linear structures by segmenting them and, thus, decreasing their free spans in the horizontal plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A description of the invention is made with two examples, pipelines placed in mountainous terrain and underwater </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings in more detail, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a suspended supporting system, according to the present invention, for an aerial pipeline placed across a steep slope is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The main carrying element of the supporting system is a cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> suspended above the ground. The cable is placed alone the route of the aerial pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> One cable carries one pipeline placed below and coincident with cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. End <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is anchored in a supporting station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to a tensioning means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of a supporting station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as is shown or both ends of the cable may be anchored depending on the forces involved. As the tensioning means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> different pulling mechanisms can be used, for example, a balance weight <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as it is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be used. Tensioning of the cable generates upward forces applied to the pipeline. Due to these forces, the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> carries the downward loads, mostly weight of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the product transported therein However, these upward forces, as it is described below, have to exceed the forces necessary to carry the downward loads because they also have to balance the pre-tensioning, forces in guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that carry the lateral loads applied to the linear structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is hung from the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by using a number of pipeline supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> placed along cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As best seen by reference also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> carry the lateral loads applied to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and transfer the downward vertical loads from the pipeline to cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each of the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> attached the pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> hung from cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and two guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having upper ends attached to the pipeline and lower ends to footings, as at <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1,2</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provides a sliding contact between cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in case of elongation, for example temperature elongation, of the cable The sliding contact is necessary to avoid additional loading caused by elongation of the cable, applied to the guy ropes of the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and/or to the expansion joints of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (expansion joints not shown) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be of different design. In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes housing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> attached to a bandage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> embracing pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A part of saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contacting the cable is a track wheel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a grooved rim <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> placed over the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves about the pipeline because of elongation of the cable, track wheel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rolls along the cable and, thus, practically no additional load is generated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Connection of guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be of different design. In the preferred embodiment, they are attached to extensions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of bandage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> carry the lateral loads, mostly wind loads, applied to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and provide lateral stability of the pipeline in the manner described below. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the upward force induced by tensioning of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is equal to the force P<highlight><subscript>c1 </subscript></highlight>balancing downward loads D<highlight><subscript>c1 </subscript></highlight>that is the weight of the structure and live loads applied to the pipeline, and the force P<highlight><subscript>c2 </subscript></highlight>that produces tension forces P<highlight><subscript>g1</subscript></highlight>&equals;P<highlight><subscript>g2 </subscript></highlight>in guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B. As it is also shown, the lateral load P<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>additionally tensions guy rope <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A by the force P<highlight><subscript>h1 </subscript></highlight>When the forces P<highlight><subscript>c2</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>g1</subscript></highlight>&plus;P<highlight><subscript>h1 </subscript></highlight>are balanced, the position of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the point where the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are attached is stable In case of opposite direction of the lateral loads, the system works symmetrically This means that pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported in the horizontal plane at these points and works similar to a continuous beam. The greater the number of supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that are installed, the less the lateral displacements of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At the same time, due to perfect aerodynamic characteristics of the system, which is practically transparent for the wind, the lateral loads applied to the pipeline are minimal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To reduce displacements of supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> caused by temperature elongation of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the supports should be placed in the middle of pipeline sections between two expansion joints In these case position of the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along the pipeline is practically unchangeable at any elongation of the pipeline and accordingly, no additional loads will be applied to the guy ropes. In cases where the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> cannot be placed in the middle of the pipeline sections, their upper ends can be displaced significantly along pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that will overload guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> In these cases, if it is necessary, a special means providing expansion of guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will have to be connected thereto. As for such a means, different mechanisms can be used, for example, springs that can be also used for damping possible vibrations of guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This means allows elongation of the guy rope and provides its tensioning under the longitudinal displacements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Lengths of supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> determine profile of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted upon the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are pulled down until the pipeline reaches the designed altitude above the ground at each point where the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are attached. To adjust the pipeline profile, guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are supplied with length adjusting devices, at <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Length adjusting devices <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may, for example, be turnbuckles that are schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Depending on the profile of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, guy rope supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can also include a hanger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> placed between the saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the bandage <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> Hanger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be flexible or rigid. Depending on length of hanger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, additional guy ropes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connecting the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with foundations <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> could be installed to reduce lateral displacements of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the foundations being placed on or formed in ground/seabed/river bed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Usually, an allowable free span of the cable in the horizontal plane is longer than those in the vertical plane In these cases, the system includes also supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> placed between supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) The supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>) transfer weight of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the product transported therein to cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as well as smooth the curvature of the profile of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> They consist of a bandage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> embracing pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a hanger <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connecting pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a hanger supporting means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> providing connection between the hanger and the cable The means <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be of different design, for example as is shown in the preferred embodiment or similar to saddle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> described above A means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is included for adjusting the lengths of hangers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Erection of the system is performed by the following steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 1) The carrying cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is installed between its supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> One end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is anchored and the other end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to tensioning means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 2) Part of the designed tensioning load necessary for stretching cable loaded by empty pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is applied to the cable by tensioning means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 3) Pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is welded, isolated, and equipped with supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on special facilities placed next to one, preferably elevated, cable supports <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 4) Pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is erected by using cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a ropeway. Pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is hung from and is rolled along cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> As a rolling means, roller saddles <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> if necessary) are used. A simple mechanism, such as a winch, is required for transportation of pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in its designed position </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 5) When pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches the designed position, guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of supports <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are lowered to the round and attached to previously built footings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Then, guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are pulled down until the projected pipeline profile is formed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 6) The tension of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased until required tension force is reached Then, lengths of the guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are adjusted, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The second version of the present invention is a modification of the system for its usage as a support for underwater pipelines. A structure of such a system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> Structurally, the system is rather close to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The main difference is that upward forces applied to the pipeline are generated by buoyancy floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> instead of cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> attached to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> substitute also for hanger supports <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be placed above pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, or under the pipeline. In the first case, floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be set directly over or distantly from pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are connected to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by hangers As a float <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, an empty metal or plastic sphere, balls made of light materials, or a collar spread along pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made of a low density material can be used The upper ends of the guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are attached to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, preferably at the same place where the floats are connected, and their lower ands are attached to footings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> The main function of guy ropes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is to carry the lateral loads applied to pipeline <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> caused by underwater currents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Still another version of the system covers cases when buoyancy force of the underwater pipeline itself (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) is larger than upward force required for the supporting system attached to the pipelines for example, in case of gas pipelines of large diameter. The only difference between this and the second version is that buoyancy floats <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are eliminated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This invention is not limited to the details shown since various modifications and structural changes are possible without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention What is desired to be protected is set forth in particular in the appended claims </paragraph>
