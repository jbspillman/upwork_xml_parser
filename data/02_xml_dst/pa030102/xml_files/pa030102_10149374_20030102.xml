<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to fabric steamers, and more particularly to a production level low pressure steam jet fabric finisher for batch steam setting of fabrics dyed by digital printers or other conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. BACKGROUND ART </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fabrics printed with dyes must be steam treated to fix or set the dyes. Unfortunately, advances in fabric dye setting processes have not kept pace with the many recent advances in printing on textiles, both with respect to conventional screen and roller printing, and with respect to ink jet printing. Accordingly, there remains a need for an effective method for rapidly and thoroughly fixing inks and dyes on fabric: the purposes being to prevent backstaining and the migration of low viscosity inks and dyes, to prevent the fixation process from becoming a production bottleneck, to facilitate post-fixation handling and processing and to ensure washability and color fastness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The fully automatic low pressure steam jet fabric finisher of the present invention comprises a stainless steel elongate cuboid housing having dimensions suitable for steam setting a large, elongate bolt of fabric. The front side of the housing has a front lockout door that provides access to a hollow cylindrical steaming chamber which runs longitudinally almost the entire length of the steamer to within a few inches of the back side of the housing. Supported concentrically within the steaming chamber is a hollow cylindrical steaming core having a plurality of holes through its sides for the passage of steam from the steaming core into the steaming chamber. The front side further includes a control panel for operator control of the steamer, which includes a pressure gauge, a temperature gauge, an electronic timer and temperature control, a cycle indicator light, a door lock indicator light, water full and add water indicator lights, a power/start cycle switch, a power on indicator light, a heater on indicator light, and an emergency shut-off knob. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The steamer interior includes a water reservoir into which a heating element is positioned. The heating element is powered by single phase power and heats water to produce steam up to a temperature of 250&deg; F. (121&deg; C.) or higher. The cylindrical hollow steaming core extends longitudinally from the front door and to a steam inlet near the top of the water reservoir, with which it is in open communication. Steam generated by the heating element rises from the reservoir and migrates into the steaming core through the steam inlet and passes through a plurality of holes through the cylinder walls of the steaming core and into the steaming chamber. When dyed and printed fabrics are to be steam fixed, the dyed or printed fabric is rolled into a layered sandwich over a helical spring coil which slides over the steaming core, and the rolled fabric is processed in a steam cycle suited to the fabric and dyes used.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a fully automatic low pressure jet steam fabric finisher, and a method of using the same, for rapid and thorough fixation of fabric dyes and inks. The disclosed apparatus and process increase productivity by reducing the fixation cycle time, by thoroughly fixing fabric dyes and inks so that the post-fixation wash cycle is also reduced, and by producing consistent results. The inventive fabric finisher is particularly well-suited for the entire range of digital ink printing production settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the low pressure jet steam fabric finisher of the present invention, generally denominated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are front and rear elevation views thereof. This apparatus is a production level low pressure batch fabric steamer comprising a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, preferably substantially cuboid in configuration and having a front side <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, top side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a right side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a left side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a back side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal dimension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the housing is significantly longer than its lateral and transverse dimensions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> respectively, adapted, thereby, to steam set a large, elongate bolt of fabric. Preferably the housing body is fabricated from panels of stainless steel connected to and supported by support members constituting an internal skeleton or frame (not shown). While this invention is not limited to any particular size for utility or effectiveness, a production scale steamer may have a remarkably small footprint of only approximately 22 by 75 inches (56 cm&times;190 cm). The preferred embodiment having this footprint has a complementary dimension of 49 inches in height (124 cm). With these dimensions, the maximum amount of fabric that can be processed in any given cycle is approximately 50 yards (46 m), in a maximum width of approximately 60 inches (152 cm) and a maximum roll diameter of approximately ten inches (25 cm) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The front side <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing has a front lockout door <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> pivotally connected to the front with a hinge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When open the door provides access to a hollow cylindrical steaming chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which has an opening <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at its front end and which runs longitudinally almost the entire length of the steamer to within a few inches of the back side of the housing. Supported concentrically within the steaming chamber is a hollow cylindrical steaming core <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a plurality of holes through its sides for the passage of steam from the steaming core into the steaming chamber (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the front side <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further includes a control panel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for operator control of the steamer. It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the front side of the steamer having an optional storage bin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> immediately underneath the control panel and having an access port in the lower portion of the front side. This may remain uncovered and open for easy access to storage space or, alternatively, it may be closed by an attached door. The access port need not be included and has no functional role in the operation of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The control panel includes a pressure gauge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a temperature gauge showing current temperature <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an electronic timer and temperature control <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for setting the time and temperature of the steam cycle, a cycle indicator light <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a door lock indicator light <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;water full&rdquo; indicator light <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an &ldquo;add water&rdquo; indicator light <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a power/start cycle switch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a power on indicator light <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a heater on indicator light <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and an emergency shut-off knob <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that the rear side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the steamer comprises a simple enclosure. Another advantage of the fabric steamer of the present invention is its portability. The steamer is preferably set on wheels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, preferably comprising locking casters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the inner canister of the fabric steamer of the present invention (including the steaming core and heating element shown in phantom). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a side elevation cross sectional view of the fabric steamer. These views show that the steamer interior includes a water reservoir <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, into which heating element <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is positioned near its base. The heating element is preferably controlled with a {fraction (1/16)} DIN controller or other suitable device. When the steamer is manufactured with the specific dimensions set out above, the reservoir is approximately three gallons (11.3 L), though, once again, such a volume does not constitute a necessary limitation for the functionality of the invention. The heating element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is preferably powered by 220V single phase power supply and heats water to produce steam up to a temperature of 250&deg; F. (121&deg; C.) or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The cylindrical hollow steaming core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extends longitudinally from a point <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> near the front door and terminates in a steam inlet <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> proximate the back of the steamer at the water reservoir <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, with which it is in open communication. Steam generated by the heating element rises from the reservoir and migrates into the steaming core through the steam inlet and passes through a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> through the cylinder walls of the steaming core and into the steaming chamber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which entirely surrounds the steaming core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When dyed and printed fabrics are to be steam fixed, the dyed or printed fabric is rolled into a layered sandwich over helical spring coil <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and each layer of fabric is separated by steaming paper. The coil is slid over the steam core and supported (along with the steam core itself) by and steaming core support <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which comprises a ring and two or more arms and which is inserted over the steam core and positioned within the interior cylinder walls of the steaming chamber to center and position the steaming core within the steaming core chamber when a roll of fabric is inserted for steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The control panel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is preferably electrically connected via a power cord <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to a standard 110V power supply with an interposing heavy duty breaker <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Electrically connected components and devices may include a power on light, a cycle timer, a temperature control, a water heater element, a water full light, an add water light, a door closed light, a cycle control/power on button, and a cycle on light (all described above); and may further include a door closed switch <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, a door lock solenoid <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a temperature probe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a pressure valve <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and pressure valve solenoid <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for releasing steam and pressure from the steaming chamber after a cycle is completed, a power relay, a time delay (not shown), and other features as modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a front end perspective view of the fabric finisher showing the front (outer) door <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> open and the sealable steaming core pressure door <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> closed but unsecured. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a front end perspective view of the fabric finisher showing the front door <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> open and the steaming core pressure door <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> open, thus exposing the steaming core <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the steaming core chamber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The pressure door <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is secured before operation by a plurality of pressure door clamps <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, preferably swiveling locking bolts with knobs for hand tightening, which pivotally engage a plurality of complementary slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As may be readily appreciated, the low pressure fabric steamer will not operate with the front door open. Once the front door is closed, it will automatically lock via a solenoid when the power to the system is turned on at on/off button. The system is then sealed. If a finishing cycle is begun, the heating element will heat reservoir water to generate steam up to temperatures of 250&deg; F. (121&deg; C.). The steam migrates upwardly and then into and through the steam core as described above to create chamber pressures of between 15 psi to 30 psi (1.02-2.04 Pa). The combination of tightly controlled heat and pressure fixes dyes and inks rapidly and thoroughly. The electronic time and temperature controls provide the user with the means to tailor the fixing process precisely to the fabrics and dyes employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Fabric steaming cycle times and recommended steaming temperatures will, of course, vary according to the type of fabric. Silk, nylon and wool are generally steamed at 222&deg; F. (106&deg; C.) for 10 to 20 minutes; cotton and rayon are steamed at approximately 220&deg; F. (104&deg; C.) for only 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To use the inventive apparatus, the following steps are including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (1) Peeling the dyed fabric to be steamed from its backing paper, working across the width of the fabric and separating the fabric and paper along the length of the fabric, and flattening it; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (2) Removing the helical spring coil from the steaming core; </paragraph>
