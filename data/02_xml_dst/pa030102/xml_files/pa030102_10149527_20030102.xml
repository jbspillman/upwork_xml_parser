<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A process for the manufacture of the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol (1) by a process comprising contacting a racemic mixture of the piperidine carbinol in solution with (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid, crystallising the (&minus;) -ditoluoyltartaric acid salt of the piperidine carbinol, isolating the crystalline salt and neutralising the crystalline salt to regenerate the (&minus;) trans isomer of the piperidine carbinol and the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid, which is characterised by one or more of the following steps: (1) combining solutions of the racemic piperidine carbinol and (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid in acetone so that the combined solution contains 2-3 % wt/wt of water, (2) consolidating the chiral salt crystallisation at from 30 to 40&deg; C., (3) cooling the crystallisation mixture to from 3 to 7&deg; C. before isolating the chiral salt, (4) regenerating the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol at a pH of from 10.5 to 11.5, (5) forming a concentrated solution of the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol in toluene, contacting the solution with heptane at 60-65 &deg; C., and cooling stepwise to crystallise the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol. Alternatively, a solution of the racemic piperidine carbinol in toluene, suitably from a previous stage in the manufacture of paroxetine, is combined with a solution of (&minus;)- ditoluoyltartaic acid in acetone. The resultant (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol of structure (1) may be coupled with sesamol, then deprotected, to give paroxetine (2), with optional formation of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of paroxetine. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to processes for the manufacture of intermediates for paroxetine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are suitable for large scale commercial operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical products with antidepressant and anti-Parkinson properties are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,912,743 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196. An especially important compound among those disclosed is paroxetine, the (&minus;) trans isomer of 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-(3&prime;,4&prime;-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine. This compound is used in therapy as the hydrochloride salt to treat inter alia depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various processes have been described for the preparation of paroxetine, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196, EP 0219,934, EP 0223,334, EP 223,403, EP 0300,617 and Acta Chemica Scandinavica (1996) volume 50 page 164. A particularly useful starting material employed in processes described therein is (&minus;) trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine, which is the (&minus;) form of the trans-piperidine carbinol of structure (1)

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the process described in EP 0223334, a racemic trans-piperidine carbinol of structure (1) is resolved by conversion to a salt with a chiral acid. In Example 5 of EP 0223334 (&plus;)-2&prime;-nitrotartranilic acid is used, and in Example 8 the resolving agent is (&minus;)-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid. The (&minus;) trans carbinol is subsequently liberated from the chiral acid salt and may then be coupled with sesamol, then deprotected, to give paroxetine (2).

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The chiral acid resolving agent specified in Example 5 of EP 0223334, (&plus;)-2&prime;-nitrotartranilic acid, is not commercially available, and the synthesis of this acid requires a number of steps. The process of Example 5 is therefore not suited to large scale manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The (&minus;)-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid employed in Example 8 of EP 0223334 is commercially available, but we have found that the process described in Example 8 is extremely difficult to control on a large scale, giving erratic yields and frequent failure to meet specification. A major problem which has been encountered is co-crystallisation of the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid salt of the unwanted (&plus;) trans carbinol isomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> We have also found that use of Example 8 conditions for the regeneration of (&minus;) trans carbinol from the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid salt on a large scale leads to unacceptable levels of impurities. Among these are ditoluoyltartaric acid, monotoluoyltartaric acid, toluic acid and tartaric acid. We have also found that the isolation conditions specified in Example 8 frequently lead to degradation and/or an oily product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention provides improved processes for the preparation of the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol of structure (1) in which the levels of these and other impurities are controlled within acceptable limits, enabling the preparation of paroxetine from a compound of structure (1) to be carried out on a manufacturing scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> During the preparation of pharmaceutically active compounds on a manufacturing scale, small variations in procedures and reactants may have a significant effect on the commercial viability of the process. The problems that need to be addressed in commercial production, and the solutions to the problems, are not predictable during the scaling up of a process that is successful on a laboratory scale. Commercial scale operation typically involves use of reactants in kilogram quantities, usually in tens of kilograms, for example at least 30 kg, more usually in hundreds of kilograms, for example 300-1000 kg. Similarly the reactor vessels used are typically at least 100 litres in capacity, more usually from 1-10 kilolitres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus the present invention has been developed with the aim of improving the preparation of the (&minus;) form of the trans-piperidine carbinol of structure (1) by a resolution process with a chiral acid, more particularly by contacting a racemic trans piperidine carbinol of structure (1) in solution with (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid, crystallising the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid salt of the piperidine carbinol, isolating the crystalline salt and neutralising the crystalline salt to release the (&minus;) trans isomer of the piperidine carbinol and regenerate the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid. The improvements to this process provided by the present invention are of significant value in a commercial process for the large scale manufacture of the (&minus;) trans carbinol of formula (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The improved process of the present invention is characterised by one or more of the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (1) combining acetone solutions of the racemic piperidine carbinol and (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid, typically in aqueous acetone and anhydrous acetone respectively, so that the combined solution contains 2-3 % wt/wt of water, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (2) combining a toluene solution of the racemic piperidine carbinol, or optionally a solution thereof in toluene and an auxiliary solvent, typically acetone, and a solution of (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid in a compatible solvent, typically acetone, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (3) initiating the chiral salt crystallisation at from 30 to 40&deg; C., </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (4) cooling the crystallisation mixture to from 3 to 7&deg; C. before isolating the chiral salt, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (5) regenerating and extracting the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol at a pH of from 10.5 to 11.5, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (6) forming a concentrated solution of the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol in toluene, contacting the solution with heptane at 60-65&deg; C., and cooling stepwise to crystallise the (&minus;) trans piperidine carbinol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The various aspects of the improved process of the present invention are discussed below with reference to the key technical areas: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> i) The Presence of Water in Acetone Solutions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Example 8 of EP 0223 334 uses acetone as solvent and specifies anhydrous conditions. We have surprisingly found that the presence of some water in the acetone is beneficial, though the amount of water present must be controlled within narrow limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> We have found that formation of the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid salt of the (&minus;) trans carbinol in acetone containing up to 2% wt/wt of water avoids precipitation of the undesired salt of the (&plus;) trans carbinol. Additionally we have found that the presence of water is necessary to achieve rapid and complete dissolution of the racemic trans carbinol. We have found that both requirements can be met by the convenient procedure of making a single addition of 4-6% wt/wt water to the acetone used to form the solution of the racemic carbinol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus in the improved process the racemic trans piperidine carbinol of structure (1) is preferably dissolved in acetone containing 4 to 6% wt/wt of water and the (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid is preferably dissolved in the same number of litres of substantially anhydrous acetone, so that the crystallisation mixture contains from 2 to 3% wt/wt of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For example this may be achieved by dissolving trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine in preferably 8 to 10 litres of acetone per kg, the acetone preferably containing between 4 and 6 % wt/wt of water, preferably at 30-35&deg; C., and separately dissolving preferably 1.6 to 1.7 molar equivalents (relative to the carbinol) of (&minus;)ditoluoyltartaric acid in preferably 2 to 4 litres of anhydrous acetone per kg preferably at 30-35&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> ii) Initial Crystallisation Temperature </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Example 8 of EP 0223 334 specifies a temperature of 15-25&deg; C. for the initial crystallisation of the chiral acid salt. We have surprisingly found that the use of elevated temperatures results in a much more robust process on a large scale, and gives more reliable results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the improved process the initial chiral salt crystallisation is preferably carried out at between 30 and 40&deg; C., more preferably between 35 and 40&deg; C. The optimum initial crystallisation temperature is conveniently achieved by mixing a warm solution of the carbinol with a warm solution of the chiral acid, and allowing the exothermic reaction to bring the temperature into the desired range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This may be achieved by bringing together the trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine and (&minus;) ditoluoyltartaric acid solutions with rapid stirring, suitably at 120 rpm, suitably as quickly as possible although a mixing time of 0.5-2.5 hours may be convenient, preferably at a temperature between 30 and 40&deg; C., more preferably between 35 and 40&deg; C., and holding the crystallisation mixture at preferably between 35 and 40&deg; C. for preferably 30 minutes to consolidate the crystallisation. Preferably the crystallisation is completed by cooling the crystallisation mixture to between 3 and 7&deg; C., for preferably 0.5 to 1.5 hours, more preferably for 1 hour, isolating the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt preferably at between 3 and 7&deg; C., washing with acetone, and optionally drying the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> iii) pH Used to Regenerate Carbinol from the Salt </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Example 8 of EP 0223 334 does not specify the amount of sodium hydroxide to be added, or the pH which is required. We have found that the pH at this point is critical on the large scale, as the extended reaction times arising from large scale operation cause hydrolysis of the ditoluoyltartaric acid, generating monotoluoyltartaric acid, toluic acid and tartaric acid. These are troublesome impurities, which are difficult to remove. Furthermore this hydrolysis reaction destroys (&minus;)-ditoluoyltartaric acid, which could otherwise be recovered and re-used, adding significantly to the cost of manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the improved process the pH at this point is preferably in the range 10.5 to 11.5, more preferably in the range 10.8 to 11.2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example this may be achieved by dissolving the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt in water by the addition of an inorganic base, suitably aqueous sodium hydroxide, and extraction of the (&minus;) trans carbinol into an organic solvent, which may be dichloromethane as in Example 8 of EP 0223 334, or more conveniently toluene, preferably at a temperature in the range 15 to 25&deg; C., at a pH preferably in the range 10.5 to 11.5, more preferably in the range 10.8 to 11.2, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> iv) Crystallisation and Isolation Conditions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the process described in Example 8 of EP 0223 334, a toluene solution is evaporated to give an oil which is triturated with heptane to give a crystalline solid. We have found that attempts to use this procedure on a large scale result in an impure product of poor crystalline form, which is difficult to isolate and dry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the improved process, a concentrated toluene solution is contacted with heptane at elevated temperature, preferably at 60-65&deg; C., then cooled stepwise, preferably holding the temperature firstly at 40&deg; C. to initiate crystallisation, with optional seeding, then at 20&deg; C., and finally at 0&deg; C. This gives a good crystalline form of the product which has low levels of impurities and can be readily isolated and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Typically the improvement comprises concentrating the solvent (e.g. dichloromethane) extract by evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure, preferably at less than 50&deg; C., and replacing the solvent with toluene. Alternatively toluene itself may be used as the extraction solvent. This is followed by concentrating the toluene solution, preferably at less than 65&deg; C., and mixing with heptane, preferably at 60-64&deg; C., then cooling slowly, preferably to 40&deg; C. over 1 hour to initiate crystallisation, optionally seeding, further cooling slowly, preferably to 20&deg; C. over 1 hour, and finally cooling, preferably to 0&deg; C. The crystalline (&minus;) trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine is preferably collected at 0&deg; C. , washed with heptane, which may be chilled if required, for example to 0-5&deg; C., and dried at preferably less than 35&deg; C. until the loss in drying is preferably less than 0.5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Optionally all or part of the (&minus;)ditoluoyltartaric acid employed in step (1) or (2) above may be recovered from previous reaction liquors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the stirring rate is significantly reduced during cooling down at step (4), suitably to 50 rpm, suitably when the temperature has fallen to 20&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a particularly useful process variation, the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt isolated at step (4) is carried forward to step (5) as a wet cake containing acetone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the extraction solvent used in step (5) is mixed with the aqueous phase prior to the addition of the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In a further useful process variation, the solvent extraction at step (5) is carried out using a centrifugal extractor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Optionally a toluene solution of the desired (&mdash;) trans carbinol may be carried forward to the next step in the synthesis of paroxetine, by omitting the procedures of addition of heptane and crystallisation described in step (6). Such a process variation is especially useful for the large scale production of paroxetine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Therefore in essence the present invention provides a process for the large scale manufacture of the (&minus;) trans carbinol of formula (1) by a resolution process with a chiral acid which comprises the following steps </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> a) forming respective solutions in acetone of trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine and (&minus;)ditoluoyltartaric acid, or of trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine in toluene and (&minus;)ditoluoyltartaric acid in acetone, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> b) bringing together the trans 4-(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine and (&minus;)ditoluoyltartaric acid solutions with stirring, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> c) holding the mixture to consolidate the crystallisation, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> d) cooling the crystallisation mixture, isolating the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt and washing with acetone, and optionally drying the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> e) dissolving the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt in water by the addition of an inorganic base, and extracting the (&minus;) trans carbinol into an organic solvent, </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> f) concentrating the solvent extract by evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure, preferably at less than 50&deg; C., and replacing the solvent with toluene, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> g) concentrating the toluene solution, preferably at less than 65&deg; C., and mixing with heptane, preferably at 60-64&deg; C., </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> i) collecting the crystalline (&minus;) trans 4(4&prime;-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl- 1-methylpiperidine preferably at 0&deg; C., washing with heptane, and drying at preferably less than 35&deg; C. until the loss in drying is preferably less than 0.5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The racemic trans carbinol of structure (1) used as one of the starting materials of the process of this invention may be prepared as described in Example 7 of EP 0223334. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> However in an advantageous variant of the process of this invention, we have surprisingly found that all or part of the acetone used to dissolve the racemic trans carbinol in the published processes may be replaced by toluene. This finding is especially advantageous, firstly because toluene is an especially suitable solvent for use in commercial manufacturing processes and it is useful to reduce the amount of acetone used; secondly because the racemic trans carbinol starting material may be then be used as a toluene solution derived from a previous stage in the commercial manufacture of paroxetine, avoiding the need to isolate the racemic carbinol. Thus, as in step (2) and step (a) above, a solution of the racemic carbinol in toluene or a mixture of acetone and toluene may be combined with a solution of ditoluoyltartaric acid in acetone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> We have found that satisfactory formation and recovery of the desired (&minus;) trans carbinol salt can be achieved by substituting toluene for acetone in conventional solutions of the racemic carbinol by adding from 1 to 3 volumes of toluene (with respect to the carbinol) to an acetone solution of the carbinol, and by using a wholly toluene solution of the carbinol for combining with an acetone solution of the chiral acid at a volume ratio of toluene:acetone of 1:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A toluene solution of the racemic trans carbinol may be prepared for example by treatment of an imide ester with lithium aluminium hydride (as described in Example 7 of EP 0223334) by omitting the final treatment with petroleum ether, and the isolation, washing and drying of the solid product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the same way that toluene may be used as a partial replacement for acetone in the conventional processes, so an auxiliary solvent, such as acetone, may be added to a toluene solution of the carbinol for compatibility with an acetone solution of the chiral acid. Also water may be added, for the reasons discussed above, i.e. to reduce the risk of precipitation of the undesired salt of the (&plus;) trans carbinol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Using this variant of the process for combing solutions of the racemic carbinol and the chiral acid, the ditoluoyltartaric acid salt of the (&minus;) trans carbinol may then be isolated and processed to liberate the (&minus;) trans carbinol in accordance with the remaining steps of the process sequences disclosed by this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The (&minus;) trans carbinol compound of structure (1) obtained by the processes of this invention may be converted to the active compound paroxetine using conventional procedures disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3912743, U.S. Pat. No. 4007196 or EP-A-0223334 whereby the (&minus;) trans carbinol is coupled with sesamol, then deprotected, to give paroxetine (2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes within its scope the compound paroxetine, and paroxetine salts such as paroxetine hydrochloride, especially as an anhydrate or the hemihydrate, when obtained via any aspect of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The resultant paroxetine is preferably obtained as or converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative such as a salt, more especially the methanesulphonate salt or the hydrochloride salt and most preferably the hemihydrate of that salt, as described in EP-A-0223403. Paroxetine free base may be converted to paroxetine methanesulphonate by treatment with methansulphonic acid or a labile derivative thereof, for example a soluble salt such as ammonium methanesulphonate. Paroxetine hydrochloride may be prepared by treatment of paroxetine free base with a source of hydrogen chloride, for example gaseous hydrogen chloride, or a solution thereof, or aqueous hydrochloric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Paroxetine and its salts obtained using this invention may be formulated for therapy in the dosage forms described in EP-A-0223403 or WO96/24595, either as solid formulations or as solutions for oral or parenteral use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Therapeutic uses of paroxetine, especially paroxetine hydrochloride, obtained using this invention include treatment of: alcoholism, anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, chronic pain, obesity, senile dementia, migraine, bulimia, anorexia, social phobia, pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), adolescent depression, trichotillomania, dysthymia, and substance abuse, referred to below as &ldquo;the Disorders&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention also provides: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions using active compounds prepared in accordance with this invention are usually adapted for oral administration, but formulations for dissolution for parental administration are also within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The composition is usually presented as a unit dose composition containing from 1 to 200 mg of active ingredient calculated on a free base basis, more usually from 5 to 100 mg, for example 10 to 50 mg such as 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40 mg by a human patient. Most preferably unit doses contain 20 mg of active ingredient calculated on a free base basis. Such a composition is normally taken from 1 to 6 times daily, for example 2, 3 or 4 times daily so that the total amount of active agent administered is within the range 5 to 400 mg of active ingredient calculated on a free base basis. Most preferably the unit dose is taken once a day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Preferred unit dosage forms include tablets or capsules, including formulations adapted for controlled or delayed release. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The compositions of this invention may be formulated by conventional methods of admixture such as blending, filling and compressing. Suitable carriers for use in this invention include a diluent, a binder, a disintegrant, a colouring agent, a flavouring agent and/or preservative. These agents may be utilised in conventional manner, for example in a manner similar to that already used for marketed anti-depressant agents. </paragraph>
