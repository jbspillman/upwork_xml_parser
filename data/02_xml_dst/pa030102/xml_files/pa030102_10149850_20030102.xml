<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A class of substituted and/or ring-fused pyrazolo&lsqb;3,4-b&rsqb;pyridine derivatives, possessing an optionally substituted cycloalkyl, phenyl or heteroaryl substituent on the pyrazole nitrogen atom adjacent the pyridine nucleus, and an optionally substituted cycloalkyl-alkoxy, aryl-alkoxy or heteroaryl-alkoxy substituent on the carbon atom adjacent the pyridine ring nitrogen atom, are selective ligands for GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors, in particular having high affinity for the &bgr;2 and/or &bgr;3 subunit thereof, and are accordingly of benefit in the treatment and/or prevention of adverse neurological disorders, including anxiety and convulsions. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a class of substituted pyrazolo-pyridine derivatives and to their use in therapy. More particularly, this invention is concerned with substituted and/or ring-fused pyrazolo&lsqb;3,4-b&rsqb;pyridine derivatives which are ligands for GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors and are therefore useful in the therapy of deleterious mental states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily; and (2) GABAB receptors, which may be members of the G-protein linked receptor superfamily. Since the first cDNAs encoding individual GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor subunits were cloned the number of known members of the mammalian family has grown to include at least six &agr; subunits, four &bgr; subunits, three &ggr; subunits, one &dgr; subunit, one &egr; subunit and two &rgr; subunits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although knowledge of the diversity of the GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor gene family represents a huge step forward in our understanding of this ligand-gated ion channel, insight into the extent of subtype diversity is still at an early stage. It has been indicated that an &agr; subunit, a &bgr; subunit and a &ggr; subunit constitute the minimum requirement for forming a fully functional GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor expressed by transiently transfecting cDNAs into cells. As indicated above, &dgr;, &egr; and &rgr; subunits also exist, but are present only to a minor extent in GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor populations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Studies of receptor size and visualisation by electron microscopy conclude that, like other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family, the native GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor exists in pentameric form. The selection of at least one &agr;, one &bgr; and one &ggr; subunit from a repertoire of seventeen allows for the possible existence of more than 10,000 pentameric subunit combinations. Moreover, this calculation overlooks the additional permutations that would be possible if the arrangement of subunits around the ion channel had no constraints (i.e. there could be 120 possible variants for a receptor composed of five different subunits). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Receptor subtype assemblies which do exist include, amongst many others, &agr;1&bgr;2&ggr;2, &agr;2&bgr;2/3&ggr;2, &agr;3&bgr;&ggr;2/3, &agr;2&bgr;&ggr;1, &agr;5&bgr;3&ggr;2/3, &agr;6&bgr;2, &agr;6&bgr;&dgr; and &agr;4&bgr;&dgr;. Subtype assemblies containing an &agr;1 subunit are present in most areas of the brain and are thought to account for over 40% of GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors in the rat. Subtype assemblies containing &agr;2 and &agr;3 subunits respectively are thought to account for about 25% and 17% of GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors in the rat. Subtype assemblies containing an &agr;5 subunit are expressed predominantly in the hippocampus and cortex and are thought to represent about 4% of GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors in the rat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A characteristic property of all known GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors is the presence of a number of modulatory sites, one of which is the benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site. The BZ binding site is the most explored of the GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor modulatory sites, and is the site through which anxiolytic drugs such as diazepam and temazepam exert their effect. Before the cloning of the GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor gene family, the benzodiazepine binding site was historically subdivided into two subtypes, BZ1 and BZ2, on the basis of radioligand binding studies. The BZ1 subtype has been shown to be pharmacologically equivalent to a GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor comprising the al subunit in combination with a &bgr; subunit and &ggr;2. This is the most abundant GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor subtype, and is believed to represent almost half of all GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors in the brain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Two other major populations are the &agr;2&agr;&ggr;2 and &agr;3&bgr;&ggr;2/3 subtypes. Together these constitute approximately a further 35% of the total GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor repertoire. Pharmacologically this combination appears to be equivalent to the BZ2 subtype as defined previously by radioligand binding, although the BZ2 subtype may also include certain &agr;5-containing subtype assemblies. The physiological role of these subtypes has hitherto been unclear because no sufficiently selective agonists or antagonists were known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is now believed that agents acting as BZ agonists at &agr;1&bgr;&ggr;2, &agr;2&bgr;&ggr;2 or &agr;3&bgr;&ggr;2 subtypes will possess desirable anxiolytic properties. Compounds which are modulators of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor by acting as BZ agonists are referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor agonists&rdquo;. The al-selective GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor agonists alpidem and zolpidem are clinically prescribed as hypnotic agents, suggesting that at least some of the sedation associated with known anxiolytic drugs which act at the BZ1 binding site is mediated through GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors containing the &agr;1 subunit. Accordingly, it is considered that GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor agonists which interact more favourably with the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit than with &agr;1 will be effective in the treatment of anxiety with a reduced propensity to cause sedation. Also, agents which are antagonists or inverse agonists at &agr;1 might be employed to reverse sedation or hypnosis caused by &agr;1 agonists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The compounds of the present invention, being selective ligands for GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors, are therefore of use in the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of disorders of the central nervous system. Such disorders include anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, animal and other phobias including social phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress disorders including post-traumatic and acute stress disorder, and generalized or substance-induced anxiety disorder; neuroses; convulsions; migraine; depressive or bipolar disorders, for example single-episode or recurrent major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I and bipolar II manic disorders, and cyclothymic disorder; psychotic disorders including schizophrenia; neurodegeneration arising from cerebral ischemia; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and disorders of circadian rhythm, e.g. in subjects suffering from the effects of jet lag or shift work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further disorders for which selective ligands for GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors may be of benefit include pain and nociception; emesis, including acute, delayed and anticipatory emesis, in particular emesis induced by chemotherapy or radiation, as well as post-operative nausea and vomiting; eating disorders including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; premenstrual syndrome; muscle spasm or spasticity, e.g. in paraplegic patients; and hearing loss. Selective ligands for GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptors may also be effective as pre-medication prior to anaesthesia or minor procedures such as endoscopy, including gastric endoscopy. </paragraph>

However, there is no disclosure nor any suggestion in that publication of replacing the benzo moiety of the pyrazolo-isoquinoline ring system with any other functionality, or of varying the substitution around the ring so as to arrive at compounds resembling those provided by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a class of pyrazolo-pyridine derivatives which possess desirable binding properties at various GABA<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>receptor subtypes.

The compounds of this invention may interact more favourably with the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit than with the al subunit. Desirably, the compounds of the invention will exhibit functional selectivity in terms of a selective efficacy for the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit relative to the &agr;1 subunit. </paragraph>

The compounds in accordance with this invention may possess at least a 2-fold, suitably at least a 5-fold, and advantageously at least a 10-fold, selective affinity for the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit relative to the al subunit. However, compounds which are not selective in terms of their binding affinity for the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit relative to the &agr;1 subunit are also encompassed within the scope of the present invention; such compounds will desirably exhibit functional selectivity in terms of a selective efficacy for the &agr;2 and/or &agr;3 subunit relative to the &agr;1 subunit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In order to elicit their behavioural effects, the compounds of the invention will ideally be brain-penetrant; in other words, these compounds will be capable of crossing the so-called &ldquo;blood-brain barrier&rdquo;. Preferably, the compounds of the invention will be capable of exerting their beneficial therapeutic action following administration by the oral route. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Typical unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. </paragraph>
