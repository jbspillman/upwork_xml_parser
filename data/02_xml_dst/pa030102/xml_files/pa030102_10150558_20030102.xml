<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The subject invention generally concerns the field of jitter measurement, and in particular concerns an apparatus and method for measuring jitter in a signal under test with a real time digital storage oscilloscope. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Jitter is a well-known term of art used to define the deviation from an ideal timing of an event in a signal. Jitter results in the mispositioning of the significant edges in a sequence of data bits from their ideal positions. In modem serial data communications systems, the serial data clock is not usually transmitted with the data, so jitter could cause data errors at the receiving end. It is therefore extremely important to determine the amount and kind of jitter that may be present in a signal under test. In this regard, it is noted that jitter comprises two distinct types, deterministic jitter (DJ) and random jitter (RJ). Random jitter (RJ) is unbounded in amplitude and assumed to be Gaussian. In contrast, deterministic jitter is not random and is bounded in amplitude, and comprises Intersymbol Interference (ISI), Duty Cycle Distortion (DCD), and Periodic Jitter (PJ). Note that Intersymbol Interference (ISI) is also known in the art as Data Dependent Jitter (DDJ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> ISI is data-dependent deterministic jitter caused by the time differences required for a signal to arrive at a receiver threshold when starting from different places in bit sequences (i.e., symbols). DCD is the difference in the mean pulse width of a logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; pulse compared to the mean pulse width of a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; pulse in a clock-like bit sequence. PJ is characterized by periodic variations in edge transition times at frequencies that are uncorrelated with the data rate. The signed difference between the measured time location of each sequential data symbol transition and the nominal symbol transition time is called the Time Interval Error (TIE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> RJ and DJ accumulate differently in a serial data communication link. If the parameters that characterize each of the two categories of jitter are available, then bit error rate (BER) can be estimated. It is therefore desirable to be able to measure each of the two categories of jitter. Unfortunately, one cannot simply choose to measure one of the two categories of jitter because both categories are always mixed together and appear as &ldquo;total jitter&rdquo;. One must separate the two categories prior to estimating their parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,356,850 B1(Wistrup, et al.) discloses a jitter separation and parameter estimation apparatus and method which is based on a Time Interval Analyzer (TIA) using an arming system. Unfortunately, a TIA with an arming system does not lend itself to incorporation in an oscilloscope without that arming system. Thus, existing oscilloscopes are capable of showing only total jitter. What is needed is a solution to the problem of measuring RJ and DJ with an oscilloscope. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a typical jitter measurement sequence, a waveform is acquired and stored in the memory of a digital storage oscilloscope. Total jitter can be measured from the waveform. The most likely jitter measurement to be evaluated is clock or data time interval error (TIE), so the first processing step is the measurement of TIE. Next it is desirable to separate DJ from RJ, and if possible, to decompose the DJ into its components of ISI, DCD and PJ. Once the individual DJ and RJ components are known, a so-called &ldquo;bathtub curve&rdquo; can be derived. From the bathtub curve, the bit error rate that would correspond to a given eye opening can be directly read. This series of steps is described graphically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, those elements <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> above the dashed line, are known from the prior art; those elements <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> appearing below the dashed line are elements of the subject invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The measurement of TIE and the estimation of BER from the RJ and DJ components are known from the prior art. A brief description of these matters is given below as an aid in understanding the invention. The novel methods by which separation of total jitter in to RJ and DJ, and by which DJ may be further decomposed, will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The measurement of data time interval error (TIE) involves comparison of corresponding edge time locations in a sampled data waveform and a calculated ideal data waveform having no jitter. TIE consists of calculating the difference in time between a threshold crossing of each corresponding symbol transition (or bit transition) edge in the two waveforms. This procedure is described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and may be summarized as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Given a measured waveform (step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), a hardware or software symbol transition edge finder precisely locates data edges (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). The data edges are assigned to corresponding data symbols (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). Ideal data edge locations are calculated (step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>), and then subtracted (step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) on a edge-by-edge basis from the measured locations to form the data TIE (step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>). Where there is no edge between two or more symbols because the symbols have the same level, TIE for the group of symbols can be estimated by interpolation (step <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>) to form an interpolated data TIE time train (step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The waveforms of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrate this approach. In this example, after the waveform is acquired, the edge finder identifies the real data edges and assigns them to data symbol transition locations. The real data edge locations are recorded as t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>. . . The next step is to calculate the ideal data edge locations. This may be done through linear fitting, PLL-based recovery of the data clock, or other approaches. The (signed) differences between real data edge locations and ideal data edge locations are the data TIE: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> e<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;t<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>,&minus;t<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>for i&equals;0, 2, 3, 4, 6 . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Notice that there are no transitions at certain data symbol locations, such as symbol locations <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The TIE at these missing transitions locations need not to be considered if only the bit error is of concern, since they don&apos;t contribute to bit error. However, they are of great interest if the spectrum of TIE is considered. Their values can be obtained by interpolation from the TIE at their neighbor locations. For example, TIE e<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and e<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>can be interpolated from e<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>. . . The TIE at interpolated locations are marked &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; so that they can be distinguished from those TIE corresponding to transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Once a complete statistical description of the jitter has been measured, the corresponding Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the total jitter can be derived (or estimated). This, in turn, allows a bathtub curve to be created. The bathtub curve directly shows how much timing margin is available for a given bit error rate. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the process of creating a bathtub curve is described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Waveform A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a representative segment of data for which the edges have jitter, as indicated by the multiple lines on each transition. In particular, this segment of data happens to have transitions at times <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are one symbol-width (or unit interval) apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each data transition is subject to jitter (TJ), which has been characterized by its PDF. The left portion of the graph B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows this PDF as it applies to transitions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the right portion of graph B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows this PDF as it applies to transition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Graph C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the cumulative distribution function (or CDF) for transition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For any given horizontal position to, this CDF gives the probability that transition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will occur prior to horizontal position t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. For transition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, we are interested in the probability that transition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will occur subsequent to a given point, so we must use the complementary CDF instead. Graph D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the CDF for transition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the CDF for transition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> superimposed. The decision error rate will be lower than certain bit error rate specified as long as the decision time is chosen somewhere &ldquo;in the bathtub&rdquo;, as indicated by the short horizontal line. This line can be positioned at a vertical level that corresponds to a chosen bit error rate, and the corresponding time interval (usually expressed in unit intervals and called &ldquo;eye opening&rdquo;) can be directly observed. Note that the bathtub curve is conventionally drawn using logarithmic scaling on the vertical axis, since the BERs of interest correspond to levels very near to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The subject invention, a jitter separation method based on spectrum analysis, will be described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 11</cross-reference>. In this approach, it is assumed that the serial data signal being measured consists of a periodically repeating pattern. The other assumption on the measured signal is that the length of the repeating pattern is known. (When the length of the repeating pattern is not known, it is quite often easily determined by examination of the spectrum of the signal.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The interpolated TIE time train obtained as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is considered to be the total jitter to be analyzed. As noted earlier, this total jitter has two generalized categories of jitter: DJ and RJ. A spectrum approach is disclosed and employed herein to separate DJ and RJ, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The spectrum approach separates DJ and RJ based upon the following observations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 1. RJ is assumed to be Gaussian; its spectrum is broad and distributed over all frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 2. DJ is periodic in the time domain and it has a spectrum of impulses in the frequency domain, since the serial data signal consists of a periodically repeating data pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Note that a window function is applied before doing an FFT to obtain the spectrum. This window function may be, for example, a Blackman windowing function, or other appropriate windowing function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> (showing a TIE Spectrum) illustrates, the different properties of DJ and RJ are readily observable in the spectrum of total jitter (TJ). Various approaches can be taken to separate the impulses from the &ldquo;noise floor&rdquo;. One of these is a histogram approach (steps <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>). If the &ldquo;noise floor&rdquo; of the RJ is flat, its level shows up clearly in the histogram of the spectrum, since a large number of FFT bins appear at this amplitude and below. Because the number of impulses is proportionately small, these show up at relatively low levels in the histogram. This histogram approach can be applied with a sliding window to detect impulses locally. The sliding window moves across the whole spectrum span. The spectrums of DJ and RJ are shown in the Histogram of Spectral Magnitude of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the standard deviation parameter of the RJ component can be obtained by computing the RMS value of the RJ derived from the frequency domain histogram (steps <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>585</bold></highlight>). Note that the effect of window function can be directly taken into account. The DJ-only spectrum can be recovered by setting to zero all those bins from the TJ spectrum that are attributable to RJ (step <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). A time-domain record of the DJ can be obtained by performing an inverse FFT on this DJ spectrum (step <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>). Note that after inverse FFT, the effect of window function should be reversed. The peak-to-peak time value, which is the parameter of interest for DJ, can then be found directly from this time-domain waveform (steps <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight>). Note that those locations marked as &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; are not counted when determining the peak-peak value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The spectrum of DJ, which consists solely of impulses, was obtained in the previous steps. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, DJ has three components: ISI, DCD and PJ. The ISI&plus;DCD jitter components can be separated from the PJ component based the following observations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 1. All impulses due to ISI&plus;DCD components must appear at multiples of 0.5/N, where N is the number of symbols in the data sequence&apos;s repeat pattern. (step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 2. Any remaining impulses are due to PJ. (step <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>) (Refer also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> From the spectrum of PJ thus isolated, an inverse FFT is performed to recover PJ in the time domain (step <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>). The parameter of interest for the PJ is the peak-peak value of its time train. Once again, those locations marked &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; are not counted when computing the peak-peak value (steps <highlight><bold>845</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>865</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The histogram of DJ and its components can be obtained through inverse FFT on the corresponding spectrum impulses. Using only the (impulsive) portions of the jitter spectrum attributable to ISI&plus;DCD (step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>), an inverse FFT is performed to recover ISI&plus;DCD in the time domain (step <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>). Locations that are marked as &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; are set to zero (step <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>). The time-domain record can now be separated into two records, where one record contains only the rising edges and the other contains only the falling edges, and a histogram performed on each of them (step <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight>). The DCD and ISI components can be distinguished from each other based on the following properties: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> 1. The difference between the mean values of these two histograms is DCD (steps <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>898</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 2. The average of the peak-peak value of these two histograms is ISI (steps <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After the Deterministic Jitter and Random Jitter have been estimated according to the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and have been separately characterized, the Bit Error Rate (BER) can be calculated as described below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> From the DJ/RJ separation procedure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the time train of DJ was obtained. The time-domain histogram of the DJ is now computed (step <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>), again without counting those locations marked &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo;. Note that this approach of recovering a J histogram is a new method. The time-domain histogram of the RJ is synthesized based on its Gaussian model (step <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>), using the standard deviation obtained during the DJ/RJ separation. The histograms of DJ and RJ are then convolved (step <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>), to get the recovered histogram of total jitter (step <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> graph illustrating normalized measured histogram vs. normalized recovered histogram. This recovered TJ histogram, when properly normalized, can be interpreted as the PDF of the TJ. Finally, the bathtub curve is obtained (step <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>) from this PDF as previously described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Based on the bathtub curve, the eye opening can be estimated for a given bit error rate (BER), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> What has been described is a novel methodology for decomposing Jitter (more specifically, Data Jitter) into its constituent components for measurement. More importantly, the novel methodology is useful in an oscilloscope because the initial measurement is performed in the time domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that the subject analysis can be applied to signals other than data. That is, one can perform a subset of the RJDJ on clock signals as well. Also, the subject analysis can be applied to multi level signals, not just two levels (with a single threshold). Both of these modifications are intended to lie within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It was mentioned above that TIE is the time difference between the &ldquo;Real&rdquo; data edges and the &ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; data edges. It should be noted that while calculation of the Ideal edges was mentioned, one skilled in the art will realize that Ideal edges do not have to be calculated. For instance, one can easily imagine a test setup where an &ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; data signal is applied to a Device Under Test (DUT), and both the input and the output are measured on two different channels of an oscilloscope. At this point one would have a Reference waveform (i.e., the original data signal), a Measured Data Signal, and the TIE between the two. In such a measurement arrangement, the result may be termed &ldquo;Skew&rdquo;, rather than TIE. Other than the fact that one expects the mean (TIE)&tilde;&equals;0 and the mean (Skew) to be other than zero, the idea is entirely equivalent, and is considered to lie within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
