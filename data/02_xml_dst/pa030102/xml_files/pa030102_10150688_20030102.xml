<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to direction control in well drilling, and more specifically to bottom hole assemblies for performing such drilling. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the drilling industry there is a need to be able to directionally drill a well so that the well trajectory follows a desired path. This may be necessary in order to avoid another obstacle such as another well or in order to accurately aim for a reservoir to be exploited. One of the existing methods of doing this is to use a bottom hole assembly including an orienting device to steer the drill bit in the desired direction. One particular application for this equipment is in short radius gas wells which are drilled in an underbalanced condition (i.e. well flowing). This technique can significantly improve well productivity, and therefore well economics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This type of well and operation has various specific characteristics. One is build-up rates of over 50&deg;/100 ft (a radius of curvature below 30 to 35 m). This causes high bending forces on the tool; the tools need to physically bend around the curve, because the geometry does not allow straight tools to pass. There is therefore a need for short, slim assemblies to help with rig-up and to negotiate the bend. There is also undamped vibration coming from the drill bit and motor, which adversely affects tool life and reliability. The techniques and requirements of this type of application are already known but all existing equipment suffers from reliability and usability problems, resulting from the way in which the tools are designed. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The general object of the present invention is to provide an improved bottom hole assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there is provided a bottom hole assembly for drilling a well, comprising a non-magnetic tubing, an orienter, a motor and bit fed with drilling fluid which passes through the non-magnetic tubing, and a sensor package contained within the non-magnetic tubing, characterized by a drilling fluid flow tube passing through the non-magnetic tubing adjacent to the sensor package, and means for determining the relative position measurement between the non-magnetic tubing and the motor. The relative position measurement is the difference between the toolface values (orientations) of the non-magnetic tubing and the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The orienter is preferably of annular form, with the flow tube passing axially through it to the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present device is suitable for use with coiled tubing and has specific advantages, in terms of reliability and operation, which make it particularly suited to harsh environments</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a drill string comprising a drill pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a mud motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a bent sub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a drill bit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> introduces a bend or deviation into the axis of the drill string, so that viewed vertically from above, the top part of the drill string is seen end on as a circle and then the lower end (mud motor, bent sub, and drill bit) projects away from that circle. The arrow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> indicates that the bearing of the lower part of the drill string, as seen in such a vertical view, can be adjusted by the orienter. We will use the term &ldquo;turning&rdquo; for this bearing adjustment (which must not be confused with the normal rotation of the motor and drill bit for drilling). Some orienters can be stepped on to turn indefinitely; others can turn only over a finite range (eg 420&deg;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows a variant of the drill string of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, in which there is a pointing orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A with torque resistant joint <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, and the bent sub is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows a typical bottom hole assembly of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> type in more detail. The assembly is suspended from suspended from coiled tubing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through which a cable <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes. The coiled tubing is attached to an orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> located at the top of a non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes through the orienter to a swivel <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which coupled it to a steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A centralizer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> locates the steering tool centrally in the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and bent sub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are attached to the lower end of the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the drill bit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is mounted on the end of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is a sensor package which comprises various sensors such as accelerometers, magnetic sensors which sense the direction of the earth&apos;s magnetic field, etc., so that the position and orientation of the bottom hole assembly is known. The non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is a casing, flexible enough to permit the bottom hole assembly to be physically bent when a well with a tight curve is being drilled, and is non-magnetic so that the earth&apos;s magnetic field can reach the steering tool. The bent sub introduces a small bend (of up to say 3&deg;), which makes it easier to get a bend in the well hole started. The fluid for the motor flows through the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> around the steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows a variant on this design, where the orienter is in a different position on the bottom hole assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In order to directionally guide the drill string, the motor and bit need to be turned (as discussed above), i.e. to have the direction or bearing of the lower part of the bottom hole assembly adjusted to a desired value. This is effected by the orienter, which turns the motor (i.e. adjusts its bearing) in relation to the coiled tubing above. The steering tool is connected mechanically to the motor below and to the electric cable above. The swivel between the cable and the steering tool prevents the cable from becoming twisted. The fluid used to drive the drilling motor passes through the coiled tubing, through the orienter, through the annular space around the steering tool, and then to the motor. The centralizer around the steering tool keeps the steering tool centred in the non-magnetic tubing and prevents it from waving around. (There may be more than one centralizer.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Both of these designs suffer from the same problems. In harsh environments, such as those experienced when nitrogen gas is the drilling fluid, there are very high vibrational forces. These are caused by the poor damping characteristics of gas and the high fluid flow rates. Under these conditions two things happen: the steering tool tends to flap around even when centralized with the spring centralizers, and the fluid flow creates vortices which can cause erosion locally in the flow path. All joints that have any free play tend to fail because of the environment which can cause serious wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the present system, a flow tube for the drilling fluid is passed from the top of the bottom hole assembly to the top of the motor. This tube is of a uniform diameter and can be constructed to have no joints that need to be broken in order to work with the tool. This creates a smooth flow path, so creating less fluid turbulence and therefore less vibration and risk of erosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> More specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the present bottom hole assembly is suspended from a coiled tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> containing a cable <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has an orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at its lower end connected to a motor and bent sub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a drill bit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at its end. A steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is located in the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a flowtube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also passes through the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, alongside the steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>; this flowtube forms an extension of the coiled tube <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is coupled to the motor/bent sub <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The flowtube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can conveniently be of roughly circular section, and it and the steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are held side by side in the non-magnetic tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, this arrangement creates a problem which needs to be overcome. In the known designs, the steering tool is rotationally linked to the motor and bent sub such that when the orientation of the motor and bent sub is changed, the steering tool orientation is also changed. In the present design, the mechanical layout prevents this from happening, so the steering tool does not respond in relation to the motor orientation. The orientation of each part is referred to as the toolface reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The relationship between the steering tool and the motor toolfaces for the known tools of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> type can be shown diagrammatically as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Arrow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shows how the toolface for the steering tool turns, and arrow <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> shows how the toolface for the motor turns. The steering tool is mechanically coupled to the motor, so these two toolfaces are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the corresponding relationship for the present arrangement. Arrow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shows how the toolface the steering tool turns, and arrow <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> shows how the toolface for the motor turns. In this arrangement, these two toolfaces are not necessarily the same. The difference in rotational position between the steering tool and the motor is called the relative position measurement. The arrow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> indicates the difference between these two toolfaces. To set the motor toolface (arrow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) to a desired value, it is necessary to take the value of the steering tool toolface (arrow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), which is obtainable from the sensors in the and then to adjust the relative position measurement (arrow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) accordingly. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the flowtube as lying centrally in the non-magnetic tubing, but in practice the flowtube will generally be displaced to lie opposite the steering tool.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For this, it is necessary to measure the difference in rotational position between the steering tool and the motor. This value is determined by a sensor inside the orienter. This sensor can be a discrete sensor such as a resolver, or the value can be determined by the signal generated from the sensors (eg Hall effect) inside a brushless DC motor such as are typically used in such an application. Depending on the type of sensor used, it may be necessary to have a non-volatile memory to remember the relative position measurement in the event of a power loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the present assembly in more structural detail. The coiled tubing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected via a tubing end connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a cable head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to an electric release unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Below that, and contained within the non-magnetic tubing, there is a sensor section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which contains a telemetry unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a sensor assembly <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The sensor assembly can conveniently contain a vibration sensor, a pressure sensor, a weight-on-bit (load) sensor, a natural gamma ray sensor, and so on. The sensor section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is generally adjacent to the steering tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the flowtube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It will of course be realized that there is considerable freedom in the division of sensors between the steering tool and the sensor assembly. The flowtube may be offset in the non-magnetic tubing, leaving a lune-shaped space around it, or substantially central, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, leaving an annular space around it. The various sensors of the instrumentation may be located as convenient in this space around the flowtube. The instrumentation can be robustly supported along the length of the non-magnetic tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The orienter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the present apparatus is preferably of annular form, such that the flow tube passes axially through it to the motor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present technique is equally applicable to rotating and pointing orienters. (In a conventional rotating orienter, the lower part physically rotates relative to the upper part to turn the orientation; in a pointing orienter, the lower part does not physically rotate.) For a pointing orienter, two position readings need to be taken from the orienter mechanism to define the direction in which the motor/bit is pointing (a bent sub is not required). These are then used to create the relative position measurement, which is used with the steering tool toolface reading to define direction of point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus the in present arrangement, a straight through flow path for the drilling fluid is created by the flow tube. The packaging of the instrumentation in the non-magnetic tubing makes it possible to provide anti-vibration mounting, and also contributes to shortening the overall length of the arrangement. Further, the steering tool is mechanically decoupled from the motor movement by using a feedback signal from the orienter; this also means that a pointing orienter can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments using the principles disclosed will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon studying the foregoing description and the drawings. It is intended that such alternatives are included within the scope of the invention, the scope of the invention being limited only by the claims. </paragraph>
