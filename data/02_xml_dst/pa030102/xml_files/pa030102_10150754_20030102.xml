<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to communications networks, and in particular to a system for controlling the bandwidth allocated to a network connection. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Wideband communications networks are established by network providers to allow communication between a customer&apos;s sites. For example, a customer may have a network <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> established between a single-tenanted building <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a multi-tenanted building <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in different cities, to establish a corporate virtual local area network (VLAN), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The network <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may comprise a wideband internet protocol (IP) core <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, linked to the buildings with optical fibre, and interfaced through network switches <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to customer premises equipment (CPE) <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The cost to the customer will depend upon the bandwidth of the network connection between the sites. In general, customers will want to keep the bandwidth provisioned to their network as low as practical to minimise costs. However, there may be an occasional need for increased bandwidth to support high throughput applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In existing networks, customers may request additional bandwidth from the network provider by informing a customer service representative. After the request is approved, it is passed to network personnel who reconfigure the network to allocate the required bandwidth to the customer&apos;s network. However, this process may not occur rapidly enough to meet the customer&apos;s needs. Moreover, the customer may only need the additional bandwidth for a short period of time, possibly even as little as several minutes. The high cost of the extra bandwidth makes it desirable to be able to reduce the allocated bandwidth after the customer&apos;s short-term needs have been satisfied. It is desired, therefore, to provide a system for controlling the bandwidth allocated to a network connection, or at least a useful alternative to existing systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, includes a customer web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a network control system, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a network model database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a rating engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> allows the customers and personnel of a network service provider to dynamically adjust the bandwidth provisioned between two nodes of a customer&apos;s network by adjusting user interface controls provided over a communications network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An implementation of the bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is described where components of the system are provided by software modules stored and executed on otherwise known computer systems. For example, the web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be a personal computer running a Windows&apos; operating system, and the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the rating engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be implemented on a workstation from Sun Microsystems&apos;, running Solaris&apos; 2.7, an Oracle&apos; database application, and an Oracle&apos; application server. The network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used is the Internet in the described implementation. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a number of the software modules and hardware components of the bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be distributed or combined in a variety of ways and at a number of different locations and at least some of the steps executed by the software modules may be executed by hardware circuits, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used to control a VLAN or virtual private network (VPN) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> between two buildings for a customer organisation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and established by a network provider. The network <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> uses optical fibres to connect a single-tenanted building <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a multi-tenanted building <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the buildings may be in different cities. The network uses optical fibres to connect the buildings through a wideband IP core <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with Cisco 6500 series switches <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The customer equipment <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the single and multi-tenanted buildings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are interfaced to the optical fibres by Cisco 3500 series and 6500 ethernet switches, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively. The network <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be currently configured to provide a bandwidth of 146 Mbps between the two buildings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The customer may wish to trial a new network software application that itself requires high throughput between the two buildings, and the customer estimates that a throughput of 800 Mbps is required, but only for a 30 minute period during the trial. The control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used to allocate the extra bandwidth by executing the following described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In order to allocate the extra bandwidth, the customer launches a web browser application on a personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but not necessarily through the customer&apos;s network. For example, the Internet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be accessed from the customer&apos;s home through a modem and an Internet service provider (ISP). Once connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the customer enters a universal resource locator (URL) (or URI) into the web browser, which directs the browser to a site operated to the network service provider. Specifically, the URL directs the browser to a network firewall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which provides secure access to the customer web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the network provider. In order to gain access to the web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the customer must login to the firewall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using a valid username, password, and a dynamically generated identification number generated by a SecurID authenticator provided by RSA Security, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> After logging in to the firewall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the customer accesses the network provider web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>). Using the web browser, the customer selects a hyperlink to a dynamic web page that generates a network bandwidth interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). The dynamic web page is written in hypertext markup language (HTML) and JavaScript. The interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a bandwidth control component <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for selecting and activating a new bandwidth value, and a bandwidth display component <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for displaying customer network details, including the site address of a switch or switches <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be confirmed, and the currently configured network bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The bandwidth control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a series of buttons <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and corresponding labels <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> that allow the customer to select a pre-defined range or band of network bandwidths. To the right of the buttons <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a circular dial <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> displays up to eight pre-defined bandwidth values within the selected band. The circular dial <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is divided into eight pie segments, as in a pie chart, with each available bandwidth value assigned to a particular segment. The dial <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> allows the customer to select a particular bandwidth by moving a pointer over the corresponding part of the dial <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, using a pointing device such as a mouse. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> after pressing the button <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> to select the lowest bandwidth band, 10-20 Mbps. With in this band, the dial <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> displays eight available bandwidth values: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 20 Mbps. In this Figure, the bandwidth value of 13 Mbps is currently selected, as indicated by the position of the dial indicators <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the green colour of the corresponding segment <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the inner annulus <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and the value displayed in the dial centre <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the appearance of the bandwidth control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> after moving the mouse pointer over the 15 Mbps pie segment <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The dial indicators <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are now positioned over the 15 Mbps pie segment <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, the corresponding annular segment <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is green, and the dial centre <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> displays the value &ldquo;15 Mbps&rdquo;. Not all of the bands have eight bandwidths available. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the bandwidth control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> after pressing the &ldquo;500-1000 Mbps&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. There are only four bandwidth values available in this band: 500, 600, 800, and 1000 Mbps, with &ldquo;800 Mbps&rdquo; currently selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To activate the selected bandwidth, the submit button <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is pressed (step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). Upon receiving the corresponding request, the web server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> executes a script that submits the bandwidth request to the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>). The network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the bandwidth request and performs a query on the network model database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to verify that the request is valid. This requires verification that the requested bandwidth is supported by the customer&apos;s network (step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>). If the request is valid, then further queries are performed on the database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to identify the switches in the customer network <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> whose configurations must be changed in order to satisfy the bandwidth request, and the appropriate format of the command that must be sent to each switch (step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). Given the customer and site, the network model database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provides the IP addresses of these switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The configuration of a Cisco switch may be changed by sending commands to the switch using a command-line interface and the telnet protocol. For example, to change the rate-limit configuration of a VLAN named &lsquo;vlan-name&rsquo; in a Cisco 6500-series switch to 20 Mbps (20480 kbps), the following command would be sent:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>set qos policer aggregate vlan-name rate 20480 burst 32 drop</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This is a request to change the quality-of-service (QOS) traffic policing policy for aggregate (i.e., all) traffic on &lsquo;vlan0name&rsquo; to be 20480 kbps, with a 32 kbps burst capacity above the stated rate-limit, and to drop any traffic that is outside the rate-limit profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> creates a child process for each switch that needs to be changed. Each child process runs an Expect script that sends the appropriate command to the nominated switch and records the response from the switch (step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>). When all of the child processes have terminated, the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> analyses the switch responses. If the switch responses indicate that all of the QOS changes were successful, then the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> performs a number of tasks. One task is to send a message to the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, indicating that the bandwidth change was successful. When the server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives the notification, it generates a notification window with an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button on the customer&apos;s web browser, indicating that the network change was successful. When the customer clicks &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to dismiss the notification window, the web page including the bandwidth control interface is refreshed. This generates a query to the network model database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the current network bandwidth configuration in order to correctly update the bandwidth display component <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the interface. Another task performed by the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to generate and send an email message to the customer, indicating the changes that were made to the network (step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another task performed by the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the bandwidth is changed is to generate a charging record and send it to the rating engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>). The charging record includes information such as the date and time the change was made, who made the change, a VPN identification code, a billing identifier, the network property that was changed, and the new value of the property. The rating engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rates the record according to a set of billing business rules and data stored in the network model database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and generates consolidated billing detail records <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>). The billing records <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> reflect the new charges applicable to the new bandwidth value, and a charge for changing the bandwidth value. The rating engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also generates an email message summarising the charges, and sends it to the customer. The consolidated billing detail records <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are processed by a Records Automation for Special Services (RASS) robot <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that enters the details into a RASS order entry and tracking system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Records from a RASS system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are processed by a billing system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that generates the final bill <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that is sent to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also allows network provider personnel to perform network changes for customers. For example, a customer may telephone a helpdesk operator and request a bandwidth change. The operator, using a web browser executing on a personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, accesses a support server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and uses the same bandwidth control interface described above to change the bandwidth of the customer&apos;s network. In either case, if the bandwidth is increased for a period of time and then returned to its original value, the customer is only charged for the increased bandwidth for the time that the network was actually configured at that higher bandwidth. However, a fixed charge applies to every configuration change. The support server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes the same code and executes the same steps as the customer server <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to generate the control interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and generate and send bandwidth requests to the network control system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The support server <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be accessed via a private customer support communications network <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Whether the bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used by a customer directly or by network personnel at a customer&apos;s request, the bandwidth control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> greatly simplifies the task of reconfiguring network switches to change the bandwidth allocated to a customer&apos;s network. The desired changes are implemented in real-time, and the configuration may be changed as often as required, subject to a five-minute granularity period. If a bandwidth change is requested within five minutes of the previously successful bandwidth change, the request is denied and an error message to that effect is sent to the user&apos;s web browser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Many modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
