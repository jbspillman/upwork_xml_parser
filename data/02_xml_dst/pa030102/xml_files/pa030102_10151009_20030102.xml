<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a capacitive moisture sensor. The sensor includes a pair of electrodes and a moisture-sensitive film, which is located between the electrodes. The dielectric constant of the film varies in response to ambient moisture. The ambient moisture is sensed on a basis of the capacitance change between the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A capacitive moisture sensor is utilized to measure indoor moisture for an air conditioner, outdoor moisture for meteorological observation, and so on. This type of capacitive moisture sensors are proposed in JP-B2-6-105235, JP-A-55-66749, and JP-A-60-166854. However, in the sensors of the publications, a bottom electrode, a moisture-sensitive film, and a thin top electrode, which is moisture permeable, are located in this order on a substrate, and the top electrode is exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, the sensor is relatively poorly moisture-proof and has relatively poor durability. As a solution to the poor durability issue, a different type of capacitive moisture sensor is proposed. In the different type of sensor, an insulating film is located on a substrate, a pair of electrodes is located on the insulating film, and a moisture-sensitive film is located on the electrodes to cover the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the different type of sensor has parasitic capacitance between each electrode and the substrate. In general, the capacitance change amount corresponding to ambient moisture change amount is relatively small in a capacitive moisture sensor, so the parasitic capacitance worsens the precision and accuracy in measurement of the ambient moisture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the above aspects with an object to provide a capacitive moisture sensor that has a desired precision and accuracy in measurement of ambient moisture without exposing either electrode of a capacitor for the measurement to the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a capacitive moisture sensor includes a semiconductor substrate, which has a hole. A silicon oxide film is located to close the hole. A pair of electrodes is located on the silicon oxide film. Each electrode is in the shape of a comb, and the electrodes mesh with each other. A silicon nitride film is located on the electrodes to cover and protect the electrodes and on the silicon oxide film between the electrodes. A moisture-sensitive film, the dielectric constant of which varies in response to ambient moisture, is located on the silicon nitride film.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail with reference to an embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a capacitive moisture sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of an n-type single crystal silicon and has a front surface and a back surface. The front surface and the back surface look in the opposite directions. The substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a hole. A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is a first insulating film, is located on the front surface and closes the hole in the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is located on the back surface. The hole is formed by etching the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the back surface using the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as an etching mask. A pair of electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is located on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> located above the hole. As shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in the shape of a comb, and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mesh with each other with a predetermined distance to increase the facing area between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a desired capacitance between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided with relatively small sizes of the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is made of aluminum (Al). Other materials such as aluminum-silicon (Al&mdash;Si), which includes aluminum and a small amount of silicon, e.g., 0.1 to 0.3%, titan (Ti), gold (Au), copper (Cu), and polycrystalline silicon (Poly-Si) may be used. The materials are commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is covered with a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is a second insulating film, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The second insulating film is not limited to the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. However, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferred to decrease the capacitance loss between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and increase the sensitivity of ambient moisture measurement because the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a relatively high dielectric constant. In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> surface of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is also covered with the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. However, the surface between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not need to be covered. A moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the dielectric constant of which varies in response to ambient moisture, is located on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and located on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is defined by the circumference of the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the capacitance between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> varies in response to ambient moisture variation, so the ambient moisture is sensed on a basis of the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is made of polyimide resin. Other hygroscopic organic polymers such as cellulose acetate butyrate may be used for the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The polyimide resin for the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a hardening temperature of about 350&deg; C. The other hygroscopic organic polymers need to have a hardening temperature lower than 400&deg; C. because semiconductor elements, which are formed on a periphery of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are not damaged as long as the temperature is lower than 400&deg; C. Because water molecules are polar ones, the dielectric constant of the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> changes significantly in response to the water content of the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and so does the capacitance between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the ambient moisture is sensed on a basis of the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are supported only by the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, the thickness of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is substantially zero under the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Therefore, the parasitic capacitance between each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is eliminated. Thus, the precision and accuracy in the measurement of ambient moisture is not worsened by the parasitic capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> includes the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has the same size as the membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, where an electric signal corresponding to the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is processed, is located around the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (C-MOS) transistors <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The transistors <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> include a plurality of gate electrodes <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, which are made of polycrystalline silicone, and a plurality of pairs of source and drain electrodes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which are made of aluminum. Other electronic devices such as a Bi-CMOS transistor may be included in the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are electrically connected by a plurality of wiring lines (not illustrated) to form a CR type oscillator circuit, so the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is transduced to frequency change to sense ambient moisture. The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located between each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to protect the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from moisture, which permeates into the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from ambient air. Therefore, the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be made of a relatively affordable material such as aluminum, which is used in semiconductor device manufacturing process, instead of relatively expensive noble metals, which are relatively moisture-proof. In addition, a leak current between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is prevented because the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are insulated by the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described later, the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured using semiconductor manufacturing technology, so the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is readily miniaturized and integrated at relatively low cost. In addition, the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are integrated on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so the stray capacitance that exists between the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and each electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is decreased. Thus, it is possible to reduce the area of the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and provide a relatively compact moisture sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured as follows using semiconductor manufacturing technology. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, impurity ions are implanted in a plurality of predetermined regions of the front surface of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the front surface is oxidized to form a thermal silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, a poly-Si layer is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are formed from the poly-Si layer by photolithography and etching. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a plurality of pairs of source and drain regions are formed in a known manner using CVD, photolithography, ion implantation, thermal diffusion, and so on. When the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD, the thermal silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is integrated with the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Afterward, contact holes <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are made in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using photolithography and etching to permit the source and drain regions in the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to communicate with the space outside of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a conductive film such as aluminum is deposited by sputtering or vacuum evaporation. The electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a metallized layer including the source and drain electrodes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the wiring lines, and a plurality of pads (not illustrated) is formed from the conductive film using photolithography and etching. The electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the metallized layer may be formed respectively from a different type of conductive film. However, it is preferred that the same conductive film is used as in the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> because the number of steps such as film deposition, photolithography, or etching in the manufacturing process of the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced and so is manufacturing cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Then, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is deposited by plasma CVD to cover the metallized layer and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>. The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the pads, through which the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a circuit outside of the capacitive moisture sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is removed using photolithography and etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed on the back surface. The silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is partially removed using photolithography and etching to form an opening beneath the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the vertical direction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Then, the membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed by etching anisotropically the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the back surface using the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Etchants such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution or tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solution may be used for the etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Finally, to complete the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by spin-coating polyimide resin, hardening the polyimide resin, and removing the polyimide resin except for a portion of the polyimide resin, which is located in the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The moisture-sensitive film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be formed by printing the polyimide resin only on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located in the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and by hardening the printed polyimide resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Modifications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the first insulating film may be a silicon nitride film. However, the dielectric constant of the silicon nitride film is higher than the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferred to decrease the parasitic capacitance between each wiring line and the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, where an electric signal corresponding to the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is processed, around the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may have only the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In that case, an electric signal processing circuit, which is equivalent to the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is provided outside of the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is electrically connected to the moisture-sensing area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using leads or bonding wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the sensor S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to form the CR type oscillator circuit, and the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is transduced to frequency change to sense ambient moisture. However, instead of the CR type oscillator circuit, a switched capacitor circuit may be formed using the peripheral device area <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the capacitance change between the electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be transduced to voltage change to sense ambient moisture. </paragraph>
