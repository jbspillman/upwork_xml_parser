<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to a semiconductor device suitably used as a MIS transistor and a method of fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In conventional MIS devices, a silicon oxide film is used as a gate insulating film because the film is stable in the fabrication process and a good insulating film is obtained with relative ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, with the recent increasing accuracy of the transistor characteristics of devices, it is being required to decrease the electrical thickness (a thickness converted into a film thickness of a predetermined insulating film (e.g., a silicon oxide film); to be referred to as a &ldquo;converted film thickness&rdquo; hereinafter) of a gate insulating film. If, however, a physical film thickness (actual film thickness) is decreased to decrease the converted film thickness, a serious problem that a leakage current increases owing to a tunnel effect inevitably arises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, possible to solve the above problem by using a material having a dielectric constant higher than that of a silicon oxide film as a gate insulating film, thereby decreasing the converted film thickness while increasing the physical film thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> J. G. Simmons revealed in Journal of Applied Physics (1963, Vol. 34, p. 1793) that a leakage current flowing in an insulating film by a tunnel effect is given by

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has as its object to provide a semiconductor device capable of decreasing the converted film thickness while increasing the physical film thickness by using a material having a dielectric constant higher than that of a silicon oxide film as a gate insulating film, and also capable of effectively reducing a leakage current caused by a tunneling effect by suppressing a lowering of the barrier height, and to provide a method of fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present inventors made extensive studies and have reached various modes of the present invention presented below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention has as its fabrication object a semiconductor device including a gate electrode formed over a semiconductor substrate with a gate insulating film being interposed between them. The physical film thickness is increased by using a material having a relatively high dielectric constant as the gate insulating film. In addition, lowering the barrier height with respect to the semiconductor material is prevented by using a material having a relatively low dielectric constant on one or both of the semiconductor-substrate-side surface and the gate-electrode-side surface of the material having a relatively high dielectric constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> That is, a method of fabricating a semiconductor device comprises the steps of forming a gate insulating film on a semiconductor substrate, forming a conductive film on the gate insulating film, and processing at least the conductive film to form a gate electrode, wherein the gate insulating film is formed by a first insulating film and a second insulating film which is formed on at least one of a semiconductor-substrate-side surface and a gate-electrode-side surface of the first insulating film, and made of a material having a dielectric constant lower than that of the first insulating film, and the second insulating film exists all over the first insulating film, or, the gate insulating film is formed by changing its composition such that a dielectric constant gradually lowers toward at least one of a semiconductor-substrate-side surface and a gate-electrode-side surface of the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the present invention as described above, a material having a relatively high dielectric constant, such as titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, tantalum oxide, or hafnium oxide, is used as a gate insulating film, and a material having a relatively low dielectric constant, such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, or aluminum oxide, is used on at least one of the semiconductor-substrate-side surface and the gate-electrode-side surface of the material having a relatively high dielectric constant. This can increase the physical film thickness while decreasing the converted film thickness, and can also prevent lowering the barrier height with respect to the semiconductor material such as silicon. Accordingly, it is possible to decrease the converted film thickness and effectively reduce a leakage current caused by a tunnel effect in the gate insulating film at the same time.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, an element active region is defined in a monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. More specifically, a trench la is formed in an element isolation region of the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an insulator (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is deposited to have a film thickness with which this trench <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is filled. After that, the insulator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is removed by CMP (Chemical-Mechanical Polishing), forming an STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) element isolation structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the trench la is filled with the insulator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Note that a field oxide film can also be formed by a so-called LOCOS process in place of the STI element isolation structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, as will be described below, this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a three-layered structure; the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed by using an insulating film having a high dielectric constant as an inner layer, and insulating films having a dielectric constant lower than that of the inner layer as outer layers vertically sandwiching this inner layer. Steps of forming the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in this embodiment will be explained below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, after a natural oxide film (not shown) formed on the surface of the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is removed, an aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>about 1 nm thick is deposited on this monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by CVD. This aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited by introducing gasified trimethyl aluminum and water as materials into a film formation chamber (not shown) by using nitrogen gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>about 4 nm thick is deposited on the aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by CVD. This hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is deposited by introducing hafnium tetrachloride sublimated by heating and gasified water as materials into the film formation chamber (not shown) by using nitrogen gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, an aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>about 1 nm thick is deposited on the hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by CVD. This aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is deposited under the same formation conditions as the aluminum oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as described above, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed by a three-layered structure in which the hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a high dielectric constant is sandwiched by the aluminum oxide films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a dielectric constant lower than that of the hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Since the MIS structure of this embodiment is not used as a memory element, the aluminum oxide films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed all over the hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>i.e., the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has entirely a three-layered structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed as described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, polysilicon, a mixed crystal of polysilicon and germanium, or the like is deposited on this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and patterned by photolithography and subsequent RIE to form a gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a predetermined shape (e.g., a band). Although not explained in this embodiment, when the source and drain of the transistor are to be formed to have an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure, ion implantation is performed at a relatively low density and a low acceleration energy after the formation of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, or an insulating film combining the both is deposited (not shown). The entire surface of this insulating film is anisotropically etched (etched back) by RIE to leave the insulating film only on the side surfaces of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, forming side walls <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Also, that portion of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is exposed to the surface is removed. This gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be removed by RIE. However, if the removal by RIE is insufficient, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be removed by plasma etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>E, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the side walls <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are used as masks to implant, into the element active region, ions having a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Activation annealing is then performed to form the source <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> After that, although not shown, post-treatments such as the formation of a dielectric interlayer, a contact hole, and a predetermined wiring layer are performed to complete the MIS transistor of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment described above, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a three-layered structure (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) in which the aluminum oxide films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a large barrier height are formed on the two surfaces of the hafnium oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a relatively high dielectric constant. Therefore, it is possible to increase the physical film thickness (actual film thickness) while decreasing the electrical film thickness (a thickness converted into a film thickness of a predetermined insulating film (e.g., a silicon oxide film); to be referred to as a &ldquo;converted film thickness&rdquo; hereinafter) of a gate insulating film. In addition, lowering the barrier height with respect to silicon forming the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be prevented. Accordingly, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by which a leakage current caused by a tunnel effect is suppressed can be formed while the converted film thickness is decreased. This makes it possible to provide a high-performance semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, an example in which the composition of a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is continuously changed will be explained. Steps of forming the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in this embodiment will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C. The rest of the steps are the same as explained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, so a detailed description thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed by changing its composition such that the dielectric constant gradually lowers toward a monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> First, a natural oxide film (not shown) formed on the surface of the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is removed. After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD by controlling the supply amounts of trimethyl aluminum, hafnium tetrachloride, and water as materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> That is, when the formation of the gate insulating film is started (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is deposited by decreasing the supply amount of hafnium tetrachloride and increasing the supply amount of trimethyl aluminum (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). Consequently, a portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is made of an oxide mixture of hafnium oxide and a large amount of aluminum oxide, is formed on the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>lowering the barrier height with respect to the monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be prevented because the large amount of aluminum oxide is contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is deposited by gradually decreasing the supply amount of trimethyl aluminum and increasing the supply amount of hafnium tetrachloride (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). Consequently, a portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is made of an oxide mixture of aluminum oxide and a large amount of hafnium oxide, is formed on the portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In this portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the physical film thickness can be increased because the large amount of hafnium oxide is contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After that, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is deposited by again decreasing the supply amount of hafnium tetrachloride and increasing the supply amount of trimethyl aluminum, thereby completing the formation of the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). As a consequence, a portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of this gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is made of an oxide mixture of hafnium oxide and a large amount of aluminum oxide, is formed on the portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In this portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>lowering the barrier height with respect to a gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be formed later can be prevented because the large amount of aluminum oxide is contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment described above, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a structure (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) in which the composition is continuously changed from the central portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>toward the two surfaces such that this central portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>containing hafnium oxide having a relatively high dielectric constant gradually becomes the portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>containing aluminum oxide having a large barrier height. Therefore, the physical film thickness (actual film thickness) can be increased while the converted film thickness is decreased. In addition, lowering the barrier height with respect to silicon forming the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be prevented. Accordingly, it is possible to form the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by which a leakage current caused by a tunnel effect is suppressed while the converted film thickness is reduced. This makes it possible to provide a high-performance semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Also, at the start of the film formation, during the inner film formation, and at the end of the film formation, the supply amounts of trimethyl aluminum and hafnium tetrachloride need only be changed, i.e., neither supply source need be completely stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the above first and second embodiments, the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed using hafnium oxide (HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and aluminum oxide (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) having a lower dielectric constant (i.e., a larger barrier height) than that of the hafnium oxide. However, this combination is merely an example and does not restrict the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the values of a specific dielectric constant k, a conduction band discontinuous value Vc (barrier height) &lsqb;eV&rsqb;, and a forbidden band width difference Vb &lsqb;eV&rsqb; of various insulating materials supposed to be usable as a gate insulating film in a semiconductor device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the characteristics of the specific dielectric constant and the band discontinuous value &lsqb;eV&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Basically, a gate electrode need only be formed using a material having a large specific dielectric constant k and a material having a small specific dielectric constant (i.e., a large barrier height). For example, in the above first and second embodiments, an aluminum oxide (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is explained as a low-dielectric-constant material. However, it is also possible to use this aluminum oxide (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) as a high-dielectric-constant material and form, on the two surfaces of this aluminum oxide, silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), silicon oxynitride (SiON), or silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) having a lower dielectric constant (i.e., a larger barrier height) than that of the aluminum oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Especially when a metal oxide having a very large specific dielectric constant k, such as zirconium oxide (ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), tantalum oxide (Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), or hafnium oxide (HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is used, the physical film thickness can be increased while the converted film thickness is decreased accordingly. In this case, aluminum oxide (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), or the like having a lower dielectric constant (a smaller specific dielectric constant k) than those of ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>need only be formed on the two surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the above first and second embodiments, HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used because ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>has low thermal stability (the phase transition temperature is as relatively low as about 1,000&deg; C.) and Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>has an extremely low conduction band discontinuous value Vc &lsqb;eV&rsqb; although its specific dielectric constant k is very large. That is, HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>has relatively high thermal stability compared with ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Although the specific dielectric constant k of HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is smaller than that of Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, it is much larger than that of, e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>commonly used as a gate insulating film. Also, the conduction band discontinuous value Vc &lsqb;eV&rsqb; of HfO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>does not extremely lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, a material having a relatively low dielectric constant is used on the two surfaces of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., on the sides of monocrystalline silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, the effect of suppressing a leakage current caused by a tunnel effect is obtained by the use of this low-dielectric-constant material on at least one surface. Conversely, it is also possible to form a multilayer structure including a larger number of layers than in the three-layered structure described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When, however, a p-channel FET and an n-channel FET are to be formed on the same substrate, it is necessary to stabilize their operations with symmetry. As explained in the first and second embodiments, therefore, it is desirable to equalize the formation conditions of the two sides (the aluminum oxide films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the first embodiment, and the portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the second embodiment) of the gate insulating films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The present invention makes it possible to form a gate insulating film by which a leakage current caused by a tunnel effect is suppressed while the converted film thickness is decreased. This can realize a high-performance semiconductor device. </paragraph>
