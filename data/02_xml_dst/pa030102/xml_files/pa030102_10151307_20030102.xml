<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a peeling apparatus of an extrusion material batch used for producing an insulator as a raw material batch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Prior Art Statement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the case of producing a porcelain insulator (including a porcelain tube), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, mixed raw materials are extruded from an outlet portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an extrusion material batch W having a rod shape or a cylindrical shape. Then, the extrusion material batch W is cut to a predetermined length by means of a cutting apparatus, and the thus cut extrusion material batch W is dried to predetermined moisture preferable for forming. Then, the dried extrusion material batch W is set to an insulator working machine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a vertical lathe and is rotated around a vertical axis. Under such a condition, the dried extrusion material batch W is machined by a bite <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to obtain an objective insulator shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this machining step, a large number of machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are generated. However, such machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are not returned to the kneader as they are, since a water content of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is decreased after machining. Therefore, a large number of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are once dissolved in a tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to obtain slurry, and the slurry is transferred into a raw material mix tank <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as returned raw materials. In a mixing step in the raw material mix tank <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the returned raw materials are mixed with new raw materials with taking into consideration of water content of the returned raw materials and a mixing ratio. Then, the thus mixed raw materials are dehydrated by means of a filter press <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. After that, the thus dehydrated raw materials are supplied into an inlet hopper <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the known producing method mentioned above, a large cost is required for a recycling step of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. That is, it is necessary to repeat the following step such that a water is added again to the once dried machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> after adding a water is dehydrated by means of the filter press <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is apparent that a lot of trouble and energy are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to eliminate the drawbacks mentioned above, various ideas for reducing an amount of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are designed at a production site. Among them, it is most effective to set a diameter of the extrusion material batch W to be equal to a diameter of the insulator to be produced. However, kinds of the insulators are remarkably large since applications of the insulators are much. Therefore, a diameter of the insulator to be produced is varied by a unit of mm, while a diameter of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is actually designed to be varied by a unit of several tens mm since it is necessary to take a lot of time and effort for varying a diameter of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> assembled in a production line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On this account, it is often the case that the extrusion material batch W having a diameter larger than that of the insulator to be produced is used. In this case, a large amount of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are generated, and thus it requires a lot of trouble and energy for recycling. It should be noted that a reason of requiring a lot of time and effort for varying a diameter of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is as follows. That is, it is not possible to perform a normal extruding operation of the batch, if only a tip diameter is reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to vary a diameter gradually for a long section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since an outermost peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W causes a shed failure of the insulator due to its streamline if it is used as it is without machining, the outer most peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W must be machined along a predetermined width on an overall circumference. This is also an important cause of generating a lot of the machined waste materials <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the machining step. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacks mentioned above and to provide a peeling apparatus of an extrusion material batch which can reduce a generation of the machined waste materials in a machining step and which can reduce a lot of trouble and energy required for recycling the machined waste materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a peeling apparatus of an extrusion material batch comprises, a circular blade arranged at an outlet portion of a kneader and for peeling an outer surface of said extrusion material batch extruded from said outlet portion uniformly. In the present invention, it is preferred that a longitudinal blade for cutting the peeled waste materials in a radial direction is arranged at a periphery of said circular blade. Moreover, it is preferred that a guide for introducing said peeled waste materials cut by said longitudinal blade into a lower pit is arranged at a downstream side of said circular blade. Further, it is preferred that a transfer line for transferring said peeled waste materials in said pit to an inlet hopper of said kneader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the peeling apparatus of the extrusion material batch according to the invention, it is possible to peel off the periphery of the extrusion material batch W supplied from the outlet portion of the kneader uniformly by means of the circular blade. Since a water content of the peeled waste materials is substantially equal to that of the raw materials in the kneader, it is possible to reuse the peeled waste materials as they are by transferring them into the inlet hopper of the kneader. In this manner, the outermost peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W, which is not used for the insulator as it is, is peeled off just after being supplied from the outlet portion of the kneader. In this case, it is possible to make a diameter of the circular blade close to a diameter of the insulator to be produced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a generation amount of the machined waste materials in the machining step. In addition, according to the peeling apparatus of the extrusion material batch of the present invention, it is possible to vary a diameter of the extrusion material batch easily if the circular blade is exchanged. Therefore, it is not necessary to take a lot of time and effort as the known one.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained with preferred embodiments. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical outlet portion of a kneader, and a peeling apparatus of an extrusion material batch according to the invention is provided to an end flange II of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The peeling apparatus according to the invention comprises a ring-shaped main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supported by the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a plurality of longitudinal blades <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constructed by inner and outer two members (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, two planar portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are arranged symmetrically on an upper portion of the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, two contact plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> projected from the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the peeling apparatus are closely contacted to the planar portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> respectively, thereby easily aligning a positional relation between the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the peeling apparatus. Moreover, four clamps <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are arranged around the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and function to firmly fix the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the peeling apparatus to the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this case, it is preferred to design each clamps <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be detached from the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the basis of the principle of leverage by loosening a bolt <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and opening an arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an inner surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a complete cylindrical shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, but an outer surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> clipping a sharp cutting edge is gradually expanded like a taper shape. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of longitudinal blade holders <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are embedded in radial recesses <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> arranged in the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is screwed to an inner end of the longitudinal blade holder <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is fixed at a center of the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the thin longitudinal blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is embedded exchangeable in a slit arranged at a tip of respective longitudinal blade holders <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and an inner tip end of the longitudinal blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is contacted to the cutting blade of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> conceptually, the longitudinal blades <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged radial at a plurality of positions on an outer periphery of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since theses circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are worn by use, these blades are arranged in an easily exchangeable manner by detaching and disassembling them from the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> numeral <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a press ring for the longitudinal blade holder <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a numeral <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is an end ring for fixing the press ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cylindrical protection cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is fixed along a preferable length at a downstream side of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the peeling apparatus of the extrusion material batch according to the invention having the construction mentioned above, a plurality of preset circular blades, wherein an inner diameter of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is set to be smaller than the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by several mm&mdash;several tens mm, are prepared previously. Among theses preset circular blades, the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a size corresponding to a diameter of the insulator to be produced is selected, and the selected circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is attached to the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outlet portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use. This attachment of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be easily performed by utilizing the contact plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the outer peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W having rod shape or cylindrical shape supplied from the outlet portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is peeled uniformly by means of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The peeled waste materials are slightly bent outward by means of an outer taper of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and are cut in a radial direction by means of the longitudinal blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing this peeling condition. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the peeled waste materials are flowed downward along a surface of the protect cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the peeled waste materials are not contacted to the center extrusion material batch W that is transferred to the insulator forming apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A flange-shaped projection <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is arranged at a downstream end portion of the protection cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and thus the peeled waste materials are contacted to the flange-shaped projection <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and are continuously dropped into a pit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> arranged downward. In this embodiment, it is preferred to arrange a wedge-shaped expanding guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> at a downstream position on an upper surface of the protection cover <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so that the peeled waste materials are smoothly introduced into the pit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The peeled waste materials dropped in the pit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are returned to an inlet hopper <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via a direct transfer line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and are used again as raw materials of the extrusion material batch W. On the other hand, the extrusion material batch W, the peripheral portion of which is uniformly peeled by means of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is cut to a predetermined length as it the same as the known apparatus. Then, the cut extrusion material batch W is dried to a water content preferably for forming. After that, the dried extrusion material batch W is machined to an insulator shape by means of the insulator forming apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Since the outer peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W, which is not used for the insulator, is removed by the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a machining amount of the insulator forming apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be remarkably reduced as compared with the known apparatus, and thus it is possible to decrease a generation amount of the machined waste materials. As is the same as the known apparatus, the machined waste materials, which are generated by the insulator forming apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are dissolved in the tank <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to obtain a slurry, and the thus obtained slurry is transferred to the raw material mix tank <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as the returned raw materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, in the peeling apparatus of the extrusion material batch according to the invention, it is possible to peel off uniformly the outer peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W supplied from the outlet portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is not preferably used for the insulator product, by means of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since a water content of the peeled waste materials is substantially same as that of thee raw materials in the kneader, it is possible to reuse the peeled waste materials as they are by returning them to the inlet hopper of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, since a diameter of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be made closer to that of the insulator to be produced, it is possible to remarkably reduce a generation amount of the machined waste materials in the machining step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As a result, the following advantage can be obtained. That is, in the known apparatus, all the waste materials of the extrusion material batch W that are not used for the insulator product are dissolved, mixed and dehydrated by the filter press so as to recycle them. On the other hand, according to the invention, since substantially all the waste materials can be returned into the inlet hopper of the kneader <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as they are as the peeled waste materials, it is possible to remarkably reduce a recycling amount of the machined waste materials as compared with the known apparatus. Therefore, it is possible to largely reduce trouble and energy for recycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the invention, since the outermost peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W, which is not used for the insulator product, by means of the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is not necessary to machine the outermost peripheral portion of the extrusion material batch W in the machining step, and thus a load for the insulator forming apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to shorten the machining time required in the machining step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the peeling apparatus of the invention, even in the case that a diameter of the insulator to be produced is varied, it is possible to easily change a diameter of the extrusion material batch W by only exchanging the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is not necessary to change a part of the kneader along a long section as the known apparatus. Only the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be exchangeable. However, the preset circular blades wherein the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a different diameter is set previously to the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as mentioned above are prepared, and all the preset circular blades may be exchanged corresponding the insulator diameter to be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the case of exchanging, the extrusion material batch W is firstly cut out. However, since the extrusion material batch W is packed in the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and in the circular blade <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a large force is required for deviating the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the axial direction from the above conditions. Therefore, it is preferred to design the construction such that the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be detached from the end flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by utilizing the principle of leverage by opening the arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> outward as mentioned above. If the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is slightly moved by operating the clamp <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be removed from the extrusion material batch W packed therein. Therefore, after that, it is possible to easily slide the main body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the axial direction so as to perform the exchanging operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the peeling apparatus of the extrusion material batch of the invention, it is possible to remarkably reduce a generation amount of the machined waste materials in the machining step and also it is possible to reduce a lot of trouble and energy required for recycling the machined waste materials. Moreover, since it is possible to reduce the machining operation of the batch in the machining step, it is possible to shorten the machining time. </paragraph>
