<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a foldable transportation container that is compactly folded to be stored and carried when not in use, and more specifically to a foldable transportation container that is easy to fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as foldable transportation containers of this kind, a foldable container disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Publication No. Sho 63-117725 is known. This foldable container has a structure in which wall boards constituting the respective side walls are attached directly to the four sides of a rectangular bottom board or to bases formed there, so that the side walls are inwardly foldable with hinge structures at the lower sides of the side walls. Further, in this container, in adjacent sides of the wall boards adjacent to each other, constituting corners of the side wall, to any one of the sides, stop members stopped to the other side are provided to mutually limit outward openings of both of those wall boards. In addition, to one of the adjacent sides, engagement members engaged with biasing forces with engagement holes formed in the other side so as to be detachable, are provided to mutually limit inward rotations of both of those wall boards. Then, lateral slide-operation of both of the engagement members is performed against the biasing forces to release the engagement with the engagement holes, the side walls in which the engagement members are provided can be inwardly rotated and thereby the container can easily be folded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional foldable container, in addition to the fact that a pair of left and right engagement members are provided at distant positions of both ends of the side wall, it was constructed so that the side wall might be folded by detaching those two engagement members from the engagement holes at once. Therefore, when the side wall is folded, the engagement state between both engagement members and engagement holes must be released by operating with both hands put on both ends of the side wall, and only one side wall can be folded once. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This foldable transportation container is conveyed by holding the handle hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in the center portion of a pair of short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or long side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, with both hands. In addition, this foldable transportation container can be vertically piled in an assembled state, and the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the above folded state can also be piled on or under the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the assembled state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Effects obtained by the above embodiment will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The foldable transportation container of the above embodiment comprises the bottom wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed into a rectangular board, a pair of short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed to stand along one opposing sides of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a pair of long side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed to stand along the opposing sides of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, on the lower end of each of the side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the bearing portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the rotational axis <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for folding each side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided, and after the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are folded onto the upper face of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, by folding the long side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> onto the upper face of the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is constructed to be foldable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition, on the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided on the center portion and the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on both ends of which the engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are formed to stand is formed. Moreover, on both ends of the long side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the limiting boards <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for limiting the outward rotations of the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed to stand, and further the engagement portions <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for engaging with the engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to limit the inward rotations of the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are provided. Further, the limiting holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the limiting protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for limiting the outward rotations of the long side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are provided in the bonding portions between the limiting boards <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and both ends of the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. And, by moving down the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, it is constructed so as to release an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be released by one touch by pressing downward the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an assembled state can be folded very easily. In particular, since one short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be folded onto the upper face of the bottom wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by one touch with one hand, in comparison with the conventional foldable container having a construction in which one short side wall is folded with both hands, the folding operation can be performed still more easily. Further, even when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, since the operation for fixing to stand one short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the supporting protrusion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be performed by one touch with only one hand, the assembling operation can also be performed very easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further, since the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed at a position close to the handle hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>even in a state that both handle holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an assembled state are held with both hands, the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is operated to be pressed downward using the thumb that can freely be moved in that state. Further, since the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be pressed downward, it is possible to very effectively apply the pressing force by the thumb to the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in that state. It should be noted that in this folding method, even in case of operating to press upward the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with the thumb, although it is almost similarly effective, for example, in case of operating to press laterally, the pressing force can not so effectively be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> On the bonding portion between the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, in order to maintain an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the assembling operation of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed very easily by providing the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the biasing projection <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> biasing the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a predetermined direction. That is, by this construction, after a pair of long side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is rotated around the rotational axis <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to stand, it is possible to automatically engage the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by similarly rotating a pair of short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to stand. Further, by virtue of the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the biasing projection <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to easily maintain an assembled state of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and ease to use when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is used can sufficiently be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> By moving down the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and constructing so as to release an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, an erroneous operation when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an assembled state is conveyed is easily prevented, and the workability upon conveyance can easily be enhanced. That is, when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an assembled state is conveyed, a finger is inserted from the lower side to the upper side of the handle hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to lift up the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. At this time, although the possibility that the finger is erroneously caught by the lower end face of the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is very high, in the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, even in the case where the finger is caught by the lower end face of the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the shape of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is constructed to be maintained in a state as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the contact portion where the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion are in contact with each other, when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> can be engaged easily and smoothly with the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by providing the second slanting face <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the outside of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (on the outside face side of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the assembling operation of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed easily and rapidly. Further, in the contact portion, the assembling operation of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed further easily and rapidly by providing the slanting face <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the inside of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (on the inside face side of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Note that this embodiment can also be implemented by a modification as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> formed into a side face with a lateral C-shape is formed to protrude on the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a spring member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is disposed in the recessed portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Note that the upper end of the spring member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is in contact with the lower face on the upper wall of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the lower end thereof is engaged with the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Further, the center portion of this spring member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be elastically deformable as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and always biases upward the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). And, biasing means is constituted by these side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and spring member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in place of forming the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to protrude on the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> in the center portion of which a circular hole or a long hole is formed to penetrate is formed to protrude, a fixed bar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is hung down from the lower face of the upper wall of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the distal end of the fixed bar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be inserted in the hole of the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Further, a coil spring <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is disposed around the fixed bar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and by constructing so that the upper end of the coil spring <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is in contact with the upper wall lower face of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the lower end is in contact with the upper face of the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is constructed so as to be always biased upward. And, biasing means is constituted by these side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, fixed bar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and coil spring <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> formed into a lateral cylindrical shape (side face with a circular shape) is formed to protrude on the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and also the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is disposed so as to be in contact with the side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Further, the center portion of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is constructed so as to be always biased upward by making the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a synthetic resin which can be elastically deformed with ease. In addition, the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided at substantially the same height as the upper end of the upper portion limiting hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed to protrude so as to extend upward from the lower end of the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. And, biasing means is constituted by these engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is constituted by five members molded into separate bodies. That is, this engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> comprises an operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> as an operation portion and vertical sliding means extending laterally, and a pair of left and right connection bars <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> constituting sliding conversion means formed on both ends of the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and extending obliquely (for example, at 45&deg; with respect to the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>). Further, on the outer ends of both the connection bars <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, a pair of left and right engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> as horizontal sliding members extending horizontally are provided. In addition, both ends of the connection bar <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are axially attached to one end of the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and the proximal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> so as to be rotatable in a vertical plane in parallel with the outside faces of the respective short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, on back faces of both ends of the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and the back face of the proximal end (inner end) of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a sliding fitting protrusion (not shown) constituting sliding conversion means formed into a side face circular shape is formed to protrude, and forcibly fitted in a sliding fitting projection <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of a rectangular frame shape constituting sliding conversion means formed at a corresponding position on the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The sliding fitting protrusions formed on both ends of the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> are constructed so as to be slidable vertically with a predetermined width in the sliding fitting projection <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, and the sliding fitting protrusion formed on the proximal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is slidable laterally with a predetermined width in the sliding fitting projection <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, the sliding fitting projection <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be molded by vertical drawing only with an upper mold and a lower mold by a long hole <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to penetrate in the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, in molds when the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on the upper and lower faces at the center portion of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a pair of upper and lower biasing boards <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extending obliquely upward and obliquely downward, respectively, are formed to protrude. On the outside faces of the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at positions corresponding to these biasing boards <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the side wall protrusions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are formed to protrude. The side wall protrusion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> always biases the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> outward of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Both side wall protrusions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> expand from the left side toward the right side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Further, the size of the second long hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed into a size substantially corresponding to the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Further, by forming the distal end of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment to extend to the lower end of the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the rectangular engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as an engagement portion is formed in a side face. As a result, in the state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> inserted in the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed so as to be able to be in contact with one side face (inside face) of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is prevented from rotating inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In addition, outer side at the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed so that the second slanting face <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed so as to slant inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> nearer to the distal end may be formed. Moreover, along the edge of the back face of the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (the side face on the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> inner side), the slanting face <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is preferably constructed so that it is formed to slant outward the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> nearer to the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In such a construction, by pressing downward the operation bar <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), both engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are laterally slid toward the inner side direction of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through both connection bars <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the distal ends of the engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> get out from the interior of the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As a result, an engagement state between the engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is released, and the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is folded inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by the above construction, the folding operation of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed very easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The slanting face <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the second slanting face <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>should not be formed on the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> or the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Or, the slanting face <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second slanting face <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are not formed on the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The center portion of the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is constructed so as to be always biased downward by biasing means. Further, by moving up the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, it is constructed so as to release an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The biasing means is omitted, and on the bonding portion between the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, stopping means for stopping the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position is provided. Further, by moving up or moving down the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the container should be constructed such that an engagement state by the stopping means may be relatively easily released, and is also constructed such that an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the case where such construction is made, when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is operated with pressure (lower movement or upper movement) immediately after the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is stood on the supporting protrusion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to engage the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, thereby the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can easily be assembled. In addition, an operation for folding the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed very easily as in the above embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In place of forming the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> along the outside face of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, it is to be formed along the outside face of the long side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is constituted by a plurality of parts, and when it is attached to the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it may be constructed so as to connect the parts integrally. Note that, as the plurality of parts, for example, the parts may be those wherein the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the above embodiment is equally divided into two or three in a longitudinal direction (a lateral direction), or among parts where the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the above embodiment is equally divided into three in a longitudinal direction (a lateral direction), two parts positioning right and left (constituting both ends) and a metallic pipe connecting those parts may be used to construct the engagement member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In case of constructing the member in this manner, the length of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> can be made long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Using three parts of an operation member <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), one connection member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and the other connection member (not shown), an engagement member <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is constructed. Note that after injection-molding the operation member <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a pair of connection members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the engagement member <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is constructed integrally with them. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> By the way, in the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of this foldable transportation container, since the distal ends of a pair of left and right biasing boards <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provided on the lower end of the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are in contact with the upper face of the lateral rib <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is always biased upward. Further, since a pair of left and right horizontal sliding members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are connected to the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by an engagement relation between the sliding engagement hole <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the circular protrusion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, they are always biased outward of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Therefore, the distal ends of a pair of left and right engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are inserted to engage in the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the short side wall is not folded inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> And, this foldable transportation container is slid downward along the sliding engagement hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, by pressing downward the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) against the biasing force of the biasing board <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), with the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> pulling the left and right horizontal sliding members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At this time, a pair of left and right horizontal sliding members <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> slide horizontally in inner side directions of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in accordance with the down movement of the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an engagement state between the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is released, and the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is in a state of being foldable inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Further, when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, after a pair of opposing long side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are placed on the supporting protrusion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can semi-automatically be made to be engaged by placing a pair of opposing short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the supporting protrusion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the case where the container is constructed as described above, a pair of left and right engagement projections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are horizontally slid toward inner side directions of the short side wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the distal end of the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is drawn out from the interior of the engagement recess <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by moving down the operation rib <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (the vertical sliding member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As a result, an engagement state between the engagement projection <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is released, and the short side walls <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are folded inside the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by the above construction, the folding operation of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be performed very easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The limiting protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>should be constructed so as not to be inserted to engage in the limiting holes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Further, an unillustrated second limiting board constituting limiting means formed into a rectangular shape extending vertically and extending in an inner side direction of the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed to protrude on the distal end of the limiting board <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, it is constructed so as to be in contact with one side walls of the limiting protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Note that, at this time, the limiting protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>need not be formed into a U-shaped side face, and for example, may be formed into a rectangular board shape extending outward from the outside face of the engagement recess <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In such a construction, when the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is assembled, the long side wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can easily be limited such that the container body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may not fall outside by bringing the limiting protrusions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>into contact with the second limiting board.
