<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to polymer blends comprising at least one tapered conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer and at least one styrenic polymer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Copolymers of conjugated diene/monovinylarene are known and useful for a variety of purposes. Of particular interest are polymers that can be formed into colorless, transparent articles having good physical properties, such as impact resistance. Such articles are useful in toys, window pieces, beverage containers, and packaging such as blister packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The polymers should also exhibit sufficient thermal stability to be suitable for use with conventional injection molding equipment. For many applications copolymer blends containing high amounts of styrene are required. Such polymers are generally prepared by blending certain monovinylarene-conjugated diene copolymers with styrene polymers. However such blends often contain an undesirable haze and blue coloration. It would therefore be desirable to develop polymers and polymer blends having a combination of low blueness, good clarity, hardness, stiffness, and toughness. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a polymer useful for preparing blends having good optical clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a process for preparing such polymers having good optical and mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention a block copolymer comprising at least three consecutive conjugated diene/monovinylarene tapered blocks is provided. As used herein, consecutive means three sequential tapered blocks with no intervening homopolymer blocks. The tapered blocks contain a mixture of monovinylarene and conjugated diene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of this invention, a polymer blend comprises at least one coupled conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer and at least one styrenic polymer, wherein the coupled conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer is produced by a process comprising sequentially contacting under polymerization conditions at least one monovinylarene monomer, an organoalkali metal initiator, at least one conjugated diene monomer, and thereafter coupling with a polyfunctional coupling agent to form the block copolymer; at least three consecutive monomer mixture charges containing monovinylarene monomer and conjugated diene monomer are provided to produce at least three consecutive conjugated diene/monovinylarene tapered blocks in the block copolymer; all the monovinylarene monomer and conjugated diene monomer contained in each charge are added at the beginning of the charge allowing excess of monomer to be present in the reactor; the at least one monovinylarene monomer contains from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, and the at least one conjugated diene monomer contains from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and the styrenic polymer is selected from the group consisting of at least one copolymer produced by copolymerizing at least one styrenic co-monomer and at least one unsaturated oxygen or nitrogen containing co-monomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, the styrenic polymer (excluding styrene homopolymers) is selected from the group consisting of at least one copolymer produced by copolymerizing at least one styrenic co-monomer and at least one unsaturated oxygen or nitrogen containing co-monomer; wherein the polymer blend comprises 60 wt % or more of the coupled conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer; the monovinylarene monomer is selected from the group consisting of styrene, 2-methylstyrene 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-t-butylstyrene, &agr;-methylstyrene, and mixtures thereof; the conjugated diene monomer is selected from butadiene, isoprene, 2,3-dimethylbutadiene; the styrenic co-monomer is selected from the group consisting of styrene, 2-methylstyrene 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-t-butylstyrene, &agr;-methylstyrene, and mixtures thereof; and the unsaturated oxygen or nitrogen containing co-monomer is selected from the group consisting of methyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The basic starting materials and polymerization conditions for preparing conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,091,053; 4,584,346; 4,704,434; 4,704,435; and 5,227,419; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Suitable conjugated dienes which can be used in the block copolymers include those having 4 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule, with those having 4 to 8 carbon atoms preferred. Examples of such suitable compounds include 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene, and mixtures thereof. The preferred dienes are 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, more preferably 1,3-butadiene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Suitable monovinylarene compounds which can be used in the block copolymers include those having 8 to 18 carbon atoms per molecule, preferably 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of such suitable compounds include styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, 2-methylstyrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene, 2-ethylstyrene, 3-ethylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-n-propylstyrene, 4-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, 4-cyclohexylstyrene, 4-decylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-benzylstyrene, 4-(4-phenyl-n-butyl)styrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 2-vinylnaphthalene, and mixtures thereof. Styrene is the preferred monovinylarene compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The relative amount of conjugated diene and monovinylarene in the block copolymer can vary broadly depending on the particular characteristics desired. Generally, the conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymer will contain monovinylarene monomer in an amount in the range of from about 55 weight percent to about 95 weight percent based on the total weight of the final block copolymer, preferably in the range of from about 60 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, and more preferably in the range of from 65 weight percent to 90 weight percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Generally the conjugated diene monomer will be present in the final block copolymer in an amount in the range of from about 45 weight percent to about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the final block copolymer, preferably in the range of from about 40 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, and more preferably in the range of from 35 weight percent to 10 weight percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At least one of the tapered block copolymer used to prepare the polymer blend of ht present invention contains at least three consecutive conjugated diene/monovinylarene tapered blocks, which are incorporated sequentially into the block copolymer with no intervening homopolymer blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The amount of each monomer in the tapered block can vary broadly depending on the particular characteristics desired. Generally monovinylarene will be present in each tapered block in an amount in the range of from about one weight percent to about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of the final block copolymer, preferably from about 2 weight percent to about 15 weight percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Generally the conjugated diene will be present in each tapered block in an amount in the range of from about one weight percent to about 15 weight percent based on the total weight of the final block copolymer, preferably from about 2 weight percent to about 12 weight percent. It is especially preferred that all conjugated diene monomer present in the final block copolymer be incorporated into the tapered blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The relative amount of each monomer in the tapered block can also vary broadly depending on the particular characteristics desired. Generally the conjugated diene will be present in each tapered block in an amount in the range of from about 0.1 parts to about 10 parts per part monovinylarene in the tapered block, preferably from about 0.2 parts to about 5 parts per part monovinylarene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The monomer and monomer mixtures are copolymerized sequentially in the presence of an initiator. The initiators can be any of the organomonoalkali metal compounds known for such purposes. Preferably employed are compounds of the formula RM, wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl radical containing 4 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably R is an alkyl radical. M is an alkali metal, preferably lithium. A preferred initiator is n-butyl lithium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The amount of initiator employed depends upon the desired polymer or incremental block molecular weight, as is known in the art, and is readily determinable, making due allowance for traces of poisons in the feed streams. Generally the initiator will be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 phm (parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total monomer) to about 1.0 phm, preferably about 0.01 phm to about 0.5 phm, and more preferably from 0.01 phm to 0.2 phm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Small amounts of polar organic compounds, such as ethers, thioethers, and tertiary amines can be employed in the hydrocarbon diluent to improve the effectiveness of the initiator and to randomize at least part of the monovinylarene monomer in a mixed monomer charge. Tetrahydrofuran is preferred. When employed, the polar organic compound is present in an amount sufficient to improve the effectiveness of the initiator. For example, when employing tetrahydrofuran to improve the effectiveness of the initiator, the tetrahydrofuran is generally present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1.0 phm, preferably from about 0.02 to about 1.0 phm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The polymerization process is carried out in a hydrocarbon diluent at any suitable temperature in the range of from about &minus;100&deg; C. to about 150&deg; C., preferably from about 0&deg; to about 150&deg; C., at pressures sufficient to maintain the reaction mixture substantially in the liquid phase. Preferred hydrocarbon diluents include linear or cycloparaffins or mixtures thereof. Typical examples include pentane, hexane, octane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and mixtures thereof. Cyclohexane is presently preferred. The polymerization is carried out in a substantial absence of oxygen and water, preferably under an inert gas atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each monomer charge or monomer mixture charge is polymerized under solution polymerization conditions such that the polymerization of each monomer charge or monomer mixture charge is substantially complete before charging a subsequent charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Typical initiator, monomer and monomer mixture charge sequences include, but are not limited to the following: </paragraph>

When employing 15 mil thick extruded sheet (400&deg; F./20 mil nominal die gap), the absolute number for blueness will preferably be less than 15, more preferably less than 5,. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Blending can be accomplished by any method known in the art including melt blending and solution blending.

More preferably the polymers are melt blended employing extruder blending techniques. Single or twin screw extruders can be utilized. The polymers and any other ingredients or additives can be dry blended prior to the melt blending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The blending conditions depend upon the blending technique and polymers employed.
