<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus and method for fields of non-invasive medical imaging, medical research, pathology, and drug discovery and development. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a variety of medical diagnostic and therapeutic settings, as well as in biomedical research, it is desirable to image a subsurface target or area within a body region of a subject. For example, non-invasive locating and imaging of part or all of a solid tumor, an area of myocardial ischemia, the distribution of a therapeutic compound administered to the subject, or the progression of a disease may provide useful research or diagnostic information. Ideally, an imaging method is able to locate within a body region a target of interest, and provide information about the target&apos;s shape, size, number of cells, and depth below the surface of the body region. However, until now, methods that have been used and/or proposed for subsurface body target imaging have generally been limited to those using ionizing radiation such as X-rays, expensive and bulky equipment such as Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI), or ultra-sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> X-rays have excellent tissue penetration, and when used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) or computed axial tomography (CAT), can produce superior image quality. However, X-rays have limited use in monitoring disease progress because exposure to X-rays is potentially harmful if such exposure is prolonged. X-rays can be used to locate and image compositions that have localized at a target within a body region, but always with exposure to the potential harm associated with X-ray radiation. X-rays, however, cannot readily be used to image the expression of gene products in vivo and determine the depth and/or shape of a target expressing such gene products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> MRI is also an excellent method for imaging targets, areas, and structures in a body region of a subject. Although MRI is not thought to possess harmful attributes like those associated with ionizing radiation, the expense and bulky equipment size needed to use MRI make it impractical for many applications or situations. MRI can provide two and three-dimensional information about targets within a body region of a subject, but is less effective at imaging physiological activity associated with a target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Ultrasound or ultrasonography is the use of high-frequency sound (ultrasonic) waves to produce images of structures within the human body. Ultrasonic waves are sound waves that are above the range of sound audible to humans. Ultrasonic waves are produced by the electrical stimulation of a piezoelectric crystal and such waves can be aimed at specific body regions. As the waves travel through body tissues within a body region, they are reflected back at any point where there is a change in tissue density, as, for instance, in the border between two different organs of the body. Ultrasound offers the advantages of not using radiation or radioactive material, and employs lesser expensive and less bulky equipment than MRI, but is limited to only discerning differences in density of underlying tissue and structures. Accordingly, ultrasound cannot effectively track and monitor the progress of an infection unless such infection results in a discernable shift in density of the target tissue. Ultrasound cannot image or detect the physiological functions of tissues or organs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Until now, Positron Emission Tomography or P.E.T. was unique among imaging techniques because it produces an image of organ or tissue function. Other imaging techniques such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and sonography depict organ or tissue anatomy but cannot discern physiological activity within them. To image a specific biochemical activity of an organ, a radioactive substance, called a radiotracer or radiopharmaceutical, is injected into the body or inhaled. The tracer is usually a radioactive equivalent of a substance that occurs naturally within the body such as water or sugar. The radioactive isotope is identical to the body&apos;s own nonradioactive isotope except that its atoms have a different number of neutrons. Consequently, a subjects body is burdened with radioactive material, and the potential harm associated with such material. P.E.T cannot detect non-isotopic expression products from transgenic tissues, organs, or transgenic organisms. Scintigraphy, a diagnostic technique in which a two-dimensional picture of a bodily radiation source is obtained by the use of radioisotopes, may also be used for imaging structures and their functions. Scintigraphy, however, is not suitable for determining the depth of a target in a body region of a subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the above-mentioned technologies for locating and imaging a target in a body region of a subject, there is a need for methods and devices to determine the depth and/or the shape and/or number of cells of such target without having to use radioactivity, radiation, or expensive and bulky equipment. The invention disclosed herein meets these needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention includes a method of investigating the location, size and number of cells, of a light-emitting source in a subject. In practicing the method, one initially obtains a first measured light intensity profile constructed by measuring, from a first perspective with a photodetector device, photons which (i) originate from the light-emitting source, (ii) travel through turbid biological tissue of the subject, and (iii) are emitted from a first surface region of interest of the subject. The light-intensity profile is matched against a parameter-based biophotonic function to estimate function parameters such as depth and size. The parameters so determined are refined using data other than the first measured light intensity profile, to obtain an approximate depth and size of the source in the subject. The additional data may be data measured from the subject, data from modeling analysis, or data relating to the wavelength of photons emitted from the surface of the subject. As examples: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The method typically includes generating a 2-D or 3-D visual representation of the light-emitting source, using the approximate depth and shape of the source in the subject, and superimposing the visual representation onto a 2-D or 3-D image of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The additional data may be obtained from computer simulation of the diffusion of light from a light-emitting source in a turbid medium. One preferred simulation approach involves (i) generating a plurality of theoretical light-intensity profiles, based on a model of photon diffusion from a glowing source located at one of a plurality of depths, and having one of a plurality of sizes and shapes, through a turbid medium having absorption and scattering properties similar to those of biological tissue, (ii) comparing the quality of fit between each of the plurality of theoretical light-intensity profiles and the first measured light intensity profile, (iii) selecting the theoretical light intensity profile which provides to the first measured light intensity profile, and (iv) obtaining an approximate depth, shape and brightness of the source in the subject using parameters from the theoretical light intensity profile selected in (iii). The method may include employing in a photon-scattering model, one or more predetermined tissue-specific light-scattering coefficients corresponding to tissue through which the photons travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another general embodiment, the additional data are obtained by measuring light emission from the subject at two or more different wavelengths between about 400 nm and about 1000 nm, determining the relative light intensities measured at the different wavelengths, and comparing the determined relative light intensities with known relative signal intensities at the different wavelengths, as a function of tissue depth. Alternatively, the spectrum of light intensities is measured over a selected wavelength range between about 400-1000 nm, and the measured spectrum is compared with a plurality of spectra measured from light-emitting sources placed at various depths within tissue, to determine the depth of the light-emitting source from matching the measured spectrum with the known spectra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments for a light-emission source, the source is a luminescent moiety or a fluorescent moiety; the light-emitting source is administered to the subject and binds to a selected target or is otherwise localized in the subject prior to the measuring; and the light-emitting source is a light-generating protein (e.g., a luciferase, a green fluorescent protein, etc.), such as a light-generating protein expressed by biological cells of the subject or biological cells administered to the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention includes apparatus for use in investigating the location and size of a light-emitting source in a subject. The apparatus includes a light-tight enclosure within which light-emission events from the subject can be detected and an optical system associated with the enclosure for use in generating a first light intensity profile constructed by measuring, from a first perspective within the enclosure, photons which (i) originate from the light-emitting source, (ii) travel through turbid biological tissue of the subject, and (iii) are emitted from a first surface region of interest of the subject. A computational unit operatively connected to the photo-detector functions to (i) fit the first measured light intensity profile with a parameter-based biophotonic function; and (ii) refine the parameters of the biophotonic function, using data other than the first measured light intensity profile, to generate an approximate depth and shape of the source in the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The optical system preferably includes an intensified or cooled charge-coupled-device (CCD), and a lens for focusing light onto the CCD. The optical system may configured in such a way as to detect photons emitted from a plurality of different selected surface regions of interest of the subject. The system may include one or more filters for transmitting photons within different selected wavelength ranges, e.g., above and below 600 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The computational unit may include a data file of model biophotonic functions representing light-emitting sources of various sizes at various depths, for curve matching with the first spatial profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Where the optical system includes filters for wavelength discrimination, the computation unit is operable to carry out at least one of the parameter-refinement operations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (i) determining the relative light intensities measured at the different wavelengths, and comparing the determined relative light intensities with known or calculated relative signal intensities at the different wavelengths, as a function of tissue depth; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (ii) comparing the measured spectrum with a plurality of spectra measured from light-emitting sources placed at various depths within tissue, and determining the depth of the light-emitting source from matching the measured spectrum with the known spectra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the computational unit is operable to average the intensity pattern image into a single intensity value, and further to determine source size by integrated light intensity values generated as a function of a light-emitting source of a particular size and shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The computational unit may have a database containing a plurality of theoretical light-intensity profiles, based on a model of photon diffusion from a light-emitting source located at one of a plurality of depths, and having one of a plurality of sizes and shapes, through a turbid medium having absorption and scattering properties similar to those of biological tissue. Here the computational unit is operable to (i) compare the quality of fit between each of the plurality of theoretical light-intensity profiles and first measured light intensity profile, (ii) select the theoretical light intensity profile which provides the best fit to the first measured light intensity profile, and (iii) obtain an approximate depth and shape of the source in the subject using parameters from the theoretical light intensity profile selected in (ii). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, the computational unit is operable to generate a visual 2-, or 3-dimensional representation of the light-emitting source, using the approximate depth and shape of the source in the subject, and superimposing the visual representation onto a 2- or 3-dimensional image of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides a method of determining the depth of a light-emitting source in a subject. In practicing the method, the light emission intensity from the subject at two or more different wavelengths between about 400 and about 1000 nm is measured. The depth of the light-emitting source is determined using the measured light intensities and information related to the optical properties of the subject&apos;s tissue, e.g., coefficients of attenuation and diffusion in the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Information relating to optical properties, e.g., the coefficients of attenuation and diffusion in the subject, may be obtained by direct measurement of the coefficients in material that is the same or similar to that of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, optical-properties information may be obtained indirectly, by determining, at two or more different wavelengths, light intensities from a light-emitting source located at each of a plurality of depths in tissue or material corresponding to that of the subject. The desired depth determination is then carried out by matching the measured light intensities with the light intensities determined at each of the plurality of depths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the latter approach, the spectral profile of light intensities from the light-emitting source may be compared (matched) with each of a plurality of spectral profiles of light intensities from a light-emitting source at each of a plurality of depths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and features of the invention will become more fully apparent when the following detailed description of the invention is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> I. Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise indicated, the terms below are defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;biophotonic function&rdquo; is a mathematical function that describes a measurable photonic output, such as a light emission profile, spectral intensity distribution, or integrated light intensity, in terms of photonic-source variables, such as source depth, size and shape, number of light-emitting cells, wavelength-dependent scattering and absorption coefficients for specific types of tissue, and spectral characteristics of the light-emitter. The photonic function can be based, for example, on a photon-diffusion model, as discussed below, on a Monte-Carlo simulation, or finite element analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Turbid tissue&rdquo; is non-transparent tissue in a subject that has both light scattering and light absorption properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Target region&rdquo; refers to an internal subsurface region in a subject, such as a subsurface tissue or organ, a solid tumor, or a region of infection, that is (i) localized within the subject, (ii) separated from the surface region of the subject by turbid tissue, and (iii) preferably possesses at least one distinguishable feature, such as a tissue or organ-specific antigen, gene or gene product, either as mRNA or expressed protein, a product resulting from activation, deactivation, or regulation, of a cell, organ, or tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Light-emitting source refers to a source of light emission at the target region. The source may itself emit visible light, such as when the target tissue is genetically modified to produce recombinant light-emitting protein when specific genes are expressed by some activation means. In preferred embodiments, different types of light-generating proteins, such as bioluminescent proteins (e.g., luciferases) and fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP, dsRed, and YFP) are employed. Exemplary light-emitting sources include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells transformed with a light-generating protein and administered to the animal subject, as well as light-producing cells which are intrinsically part of an animal made transgenic for a light-generating reporter gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the source may include fluorescent or other molecules that can be excited by electromagnetic radiation to emit visible light. For example, a composition effective to cause a target to emit light may be administered to the subject and allowed to localize at the target location wherein the composition will then emit light, or cause some other moiety in or adjacent the target to emit light. For example, the administered composition may be a compound which activates cells in or adjacent the target, and in-turn, causes such cells to emit light, hence, the localized cells are the target within the subject&apos;s body region. In yet other embodiments, infectious cells are administered to a subject, and the progress and locality of the disease are determined. The target, in this embodiment, is the cluster of cells at a given point having a location within the body region of the subject. In other embodiments of the invention, a body region may have multiple targets, and a subject may have multiple body regions, each region potentially having a target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Fluorochromes&rdquo; or &ldquo;fluorophores&rdquo; are molecules which are excited at or effectively near an excitation maxima, and emit or fluoresce light at longer wavelengths. The difference between the excitation maxima of a fluorochrome, and the emission maxima of the fluorochrome, is known as a Stokes shift. The greater the Stokes shift for a given fluorochrome, the greater the difference in between the excitation spectrum, or range of wavelengths, which excites the fluorochrome, and the emission spectrum or range of wavelengths of light emitted by the fluorochrome when is fluoresces. Certain embodiments of the invention employ fluorochromes with high Stokes shifts such with Texas Red, rhodamine, Cy3, Cy5, Cy7, and other deep, far red, or near infra-red (NIRF) fluorochromes. Particularly preferred fluorochromes emit light at wavelengths longer than about 600 nanometers. Other preferred fluorochromes will emit light in ranges shorter than 600 nanometers. In particular, variants of &ldquo;green fluorescent protein&rdquo; (GFP), each having various emission spectra, are particularly useful because, like luciferase, such proteins may be synthesized by the target or cells adjacent or associated with the target, or which localized at the target, for example, as in an infection. GFPs may further be administered as a conjugate to another protein or biological material that localizes at the target or targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, each light-emitting source, under known light-emitting conditions, has a known emission spectrum. Each emission spectrum is preferably constant throughout the detection step. In particular, the relative intensity of light emission at each wavelength of light remains relative to the intensity of light emission at all other wavelengths of light within the emission spectrum of the light-emitting source, as the overall intensity of the spectrum changes. Some embodiments of the invention minimally require at least two distinguishable ranges of wavelengths of emitted light. More preferably, particular embodiments of the invention require that each range of wavelengths of light behave differently, as a function of the distance or depth for which such light travels through the body region, from other ranges as they travel through a selected body region of a subject. For example, the intensity of a first range of wavelengths of light is cut in half for every centimeter of a body region the light travels, whereas a second range of wavelengths of light is cut by three fourth for every centimeter of body region the light travels through. The intensity of light having both ranges of wavelengths, where each range has the same intensity, will diminish by one half at the first range, and three quarters at the second range, after passing through one centimeter of tissue. By comparing the resulting 2:1 ratio of intensities from the initial 1:1 ratio of intensities at tissue depth zero, a determination that the light traveled one centimeter through the tissue can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The invention may be practiced using different light-emitting sources such as different luciferase enzymes. For example, the light emission from &ldquo;blue&rdquo; bacterial luciferase (<highlight><italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic></highlight>) expressed on agar was analyzed by a spectrometer that revealed a spectrum centered about 485 nm. A &ldquo;green&rdquo; firefly luciferase (<highlight><italic>Photinus pyralis</italic></highlight>) expressed in PC-3M cells in PBS solution emitted light demonstrating a spectrum centered about 570 nm. A &ldquo;red&rdquo; luciferase expressed in PC-3M cells suspended in PBS solution demonstrated a spectrum centered about 620 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> II Apparatus and Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which may be used in investigating the location and size of a light-emitting source in a subject, in accordance with the invention. The apparatus generally includes a light-tight enclosure or chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within which light-emission events from the subject can be detected. Light tight box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed as described in co-owned PCT publication number WO 200163247, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, the chamber is defined by back and side walls, such as back wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and has a front opening (not shown, which can opened to provided access to the interior of the chamber, and closed to provide a light-tight seal. Although light tight box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> was designed for small animals, the technology can also be applied to larger mammals, including humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Contained within the chamber is a stage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on which the subject is placed and preferably immobilized during light-emission detection. Although many of the examples described herein have to do with a small mammalian subject, typically a mouse or a rat, it will be appreciated that the same principles and methods will apply to other animals as well as human subjects, employing suitable scale-up in chamber size and where necessary, suitable increases in the size and number of light emitters in the target region. The stage in the apparatus shown is designed to be raised and lowered to a selected vertical position within the chamber by a conventional wormscrew mechanism shown generally at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and under user control. The stage position within the chamber may be monitored by any of a number of known tracking devices that do not require visible light signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The viewing optics includes to two general components. The first is a lens assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that serves to focus light-emission events from the surface of the subject onto the detection screen of a photodetector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is typically a photodetector pixel array of a charged-coupled device that can be operated in a cooled condition to minimize intrinsic noise level. The construction of the lens assembly and its optical coupling to the detector is conventional. One preferred CCD is a model 620 CCD, commercially available from Spectral Instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The second, and optional, component of the optical system is a wavelength filter wheel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> containing a number of optical bandpass filters designed to block light transmission in all but a selected range of visible-light wavelengths. One standard installation includes 3 filters; a shortpass filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for wavelengths less than 510 nm (blue light filter), a midpass filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a bandpass in the 500-570 nm range (green light filter), and a longpass filter for wavelengths greater than 590 nm (red light filter). In some applications, filters can provide more precise bandpass, e.g., every 20 nm. The just-described viewing optics and detector are also referred to herein, collectively, as an optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The apparatus also includes a control unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Various user-controlled settings, such as stage height, orientation, and translation position, bandpass filter, and detector mode are made through a control input pane; <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows a more schematic representation of apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, here shown in a scale for use in imaging a small mammalian subject, such as a mouse <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The lens assembly is represented here as a single lens <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the filter wheel at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a CCD detector at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The detector output is supplied to a computational unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the control unit computational unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which includes a processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a storage unit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for data files. The content of the data files, and operation of the computational unit, in response to light-detection signals from the designs from detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be described below. The control unit is operatively connected to a display/output device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such as a computer monitor, for displaying information and images to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The operation of the computational unit can be appreciated from the method of the invention carried out by the apparatus, which will be summarized with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and detailed further below. The first step in the method is to obtain a first measured light-intensity profile. This is done by first localizing a light-emitting source within a subject. This may be done, as noted above, in a variety of ways, including introducing into the subject, a gene effective to produce a light-emitting protein, such as luciferase, in the target region, or localizing a fluorescent compound at the target source, both according to methods which are known, e.g., as described in co-owned PCT applications WO99US/30078, WO00US/7296, WO99US30080; and WO97US6578, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The subject so prepared is placed in the light-tight chamber, and light-emission form the subject surface originating from light-emission events at the target region are measured, digitized, and placed in the computational unit, as at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The computational unit uses this data to generate a spatial profile of light emission, as at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This profile could be taken along a selected row and a selected column of detector elements in the detector representing profiles along x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes in a plane parallel to the stage in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. That is, the profile is a plot of measured intensity values along a selected row and column of detector elements, and represents the distribution of light intensity values that are focused from the subject surface onto the detector array. Exemplary light-intensity values measured from a subject are shown in solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows the emission contours, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows the vertical profile, as determined at detector pixels corresponding to those positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Turning back now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the spatial profile or profiles so obtained are matched or fitted with profiles stored in a database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of parameter-based photonic functions which are either empirical functions measured from light-emitting sources of known size and depth, or are calculated from photon-diffusion models using depth and size parameters, and optionally, other parameters, as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> From the optimal curve match, the program can make an initial estimated determination of depth and/or size and/or brightness, preferably all three, of the light-emitting source. According to a feature of the invention, the method is now carried out in a way that the depth and size determinations are refined by additional data that may be in the form of additional light-intensity data, and/or additional modeling data. For example, and as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the data may be in the form of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> (a) 2nd-view data, as at <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, meaning light-intensity data, typically spatial profile data, obtained by viewing the subject from a second view angle. Typically, the subject in the apparatus is tilted with respect to the optical system so that light-emission is obtained from a second region of the subject surface; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (b) Spectral data, as at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, meaning light-intensity data obtained at one or more bandpass ranges, e.g., in a blue-light, green-light, or red-light spectral range; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (c) Transmittance data, as at <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, meaning predetermined-light intensity values obtained typically as a function of wavelength at selected locations in a subject that approximates the subject of interest; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> (d) Tissue properties data, as at <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, meaning predetermined values of tissue parameters, such as reduced scattering coefficient &mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>, absorption coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, or effective coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>corresponding to the subject tissue through which light is diffusing. This data is used, for example, to refine the spatial profile curves generated by a diffusion model; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (e) Simulation data, as at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, meaning predetermined light-intensity values, typically spatial profile data, obtained by placing a light-source of known intensity and size at selected locations in a model representing the subject target region and adjacent surface, or in an actual subject that approximates the subject; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> (f) Total intensity data, as at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, meaning total light intensity summed or integrated over an entire spatial profile or an entire detector array. The program run by the computation device receives the additional information at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and uses the information to refine the depth and size determination of the light-emitting source, at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, as will be considered below. Finally, the refined determination of source depth, size, and optionally, shape and number of cells in the light-emitting source, is displayed to the user, either in the form of data and/or one or more subject images showing the location and intensity of the light-emitting source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (g) Absolute calibrated light intensity, as at <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Calibration to absolute intensity allows one to convert counts/sec/pixel in the CCD to radiance photons/s/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/sr (sr&equals;steradians). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> illustrates an optical assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> used in the calibration method. The assembly includes, in addition to a CCD detector <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (representing a lens assembly, as above), a bandpass filter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a low-light-level integrating sphere, such as a OL Series <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> sphere available from Optronic Laboratories, which acts as a source of a known light intensity. The known radiance from the sphere, measured in photons/sec/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/sr, allows one to calculate the calibration factor that relates the two numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> illustrates how absolute measured intensity is used to calculate total number of cells in a light-emitting source. It is assumed that each cell will produce a photon flux &phgr;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>photons/sec/cell. The radiance from a light-emitting source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in a subject <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as measured by detector <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, measures the number of photons/s/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/sr. The measured radiance is then integrated over a region of interest to convert to a source flux &phgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>photons/sec. From the known flux values, the number of cells in the light-emitting source is readily calculated as &phgr;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>/&phgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> III. Light-Emission Data and Parameters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> This section considers various types of light-emission data that may be collected in practicing the invention, and discusses how the data may be used in photon-diffusion modeling, and/or for determining depth or size of a light-emitting source based on curve matching with a model diffusion curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Light-intensity spatial profile. The basic light-emission data that is determined is a light-intensity spatial profile which has been described above, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. A measured light-intensity spatial profile shows the spatial distribution of light intensity emitted from the surface region of subject. The light-intensity spatial profile may be obtained along a single line, along 2 or more lines (e.g., along the x and y directions with respect to the stage supporting the subject). The entire 2D surface distribution of light may also be used. A modeled spatial profile represents the predicted light-intensity spatial distribution calculated from a model of photon diffusion through a turbid tissue. By matching a measured profile with a modeled profile, an approximate depth and/or size of light-emitting source can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Total light intensity. Total light intensity is the total light intensity summed or integrated over all of the detector elements in the detector. Total light intensity can be used as a further constraint on the fitting model used to determine source, location, and brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Absolute calibrated light intensity. As described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the absolute light-intensity flux can be used to measure total flux from the light-emitting source. Assuming that this source is made up of cells which each emit an average cell flux &phgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, the total number of light-emitting cells making up the source can be determined. This determination, in turn, can be used to refine the total source mass or volume determination, based on a known or estimated cell mass ratio for the tissue source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Spectral data. Spectral data is light-intensity data collected at particular wavelength ranges, e.g., the blue-light, green-light, and red-light wavelength ranges noted above. Because light is absorbed preferentially at shorter wavelengths by subject tissue, and particularly by hemoglobin in subject tissue, the relative intensities of light at different wavelengths, can provide information about source depth and can be used in producing refined wavelength-dependent spatial profiles, based on wavelength-dependent tissue scattering and absorption coefficients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> depict the differential effect distance or depth has upon light that travels through the tissue of the body region, at different wavelengths or ranges of wavelengths. The graph shows increasing light intensity on the y-axis and increasing light wavelength on the x-axis. The solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> represents the in vitro emission spectra for the light-emitting source that correlates to a zero-depth emission spectrum which comprises a broad single peak centered about 495 nm. The broad dashed line represents the emission spectrum of the light-emitting source after it has passed through about one millimeter of tissue (in vivo). At about 600 nm, the one millimeter depth emission spectrum develops a small peak, as the once large peak at about 495 nm begins to diminish in relative intensity. The intermediate dashed line represents the emission spectrum of the light-emitting source after it has passed through about two millimeters of tissue (in vivo). The 495 nm peak becomes lesser in intensity, while the 600 nm peak increases and becomes more pronounced. Lastly, the dotted line represents the emission spectrum of the light-emitting source after it has passed through about four millimeters of tissue (in vivo) where the 495 nm peak has been further reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> represents the emission spectrum at four millimeters depth of tissue scaled against the zero tissue depth emission spectra. The 600 nm peak is prominent over the once prominent 495 nm peak. In this example, it is the ratio of the 600 nm peak to the 495 nm peak that provides information about the depth of the light-emitting source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Preferred methods of the invention employ self-scaling computations so that the depth of the light-emitting source may be determined independent of its overall intensity. To achieve this end, functions are formulated that utilize ratios of two or more ranges of wavelengths, where each range of wavelengths travels through tissue in a body region at different rates as a function of depth of the target from the surface of the body region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Through-body transmittance. Through-body transmittance is measured by placing a know-intensity light-source at a selected location against or inside a subject, and measuring the light-intensity that is transmitted through the subject on multiple surfaces. The transmittance will have a strong spectral component, owing to the strong spectral dependence of the scattering and absorption coefficients of different tissues (see below). Typically, transmittance values are pre-determined using a model subject, by measuring total transmittance at various selected locations and at each of a number of spectral ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a top view of a subject having a plurality of body regions indicated by numbers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this example, the subject is an immobilized mouse, and each body region corresponds to pre-determined regions of interest. Prior to depth determinations by the practice of the methods of the invention, the subject is optically analyzed to develop a data file of optical characteristics for each body region. In this example, each body region is placed between a spectral light source and a spectral detector. Light transmission spectra are obtained for each body region. The result is analogous to placing each body region in a spectrophotometer cuvette and measuring the spectral profile of each region at different wavelengths and wavelength ranges, to create a data file of how light transmits through different body regions, and the tissues within such regions. The device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be used to develop similar data for particular ranges of wavelengths provided the device is adapted to trans-illuminate, with respect to the detector, the subject at each body region tested. Thus, the device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> becomes, in essence, a whole animal spectrophotometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> show the empirical spectral data gathered from the spectral analysis described immediately above. As is described below in more detail, this data, either as whole spectra, or particular ranges within each spectrum, can be used to create the data files for comparison with detected intensity information, or for developing functions to compute target depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In a more detailed approach, the apparatus provides a whole body scanner for scanning an entire subject, or portions thereof, which further comprises a scanning two-color laser for scanning the body of a subject. The scanner moves through an arc laser light of at least two colors, either simultaneously, or sequentially. As the laser light beams upward, it penetrates the body of a subject placed within a rotational tube. The detector placed opposite the laser light source is adapted to receive and measure the laser light as it moves through its arc path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Tissue optical properties. There are two important optical properties of subject tissue used in photon diffusion modeling. The first is the absorption coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>of the tissue, which is related to the fraction of incident light that is absorbed per unit pathlength. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, which plot absorption coefficients for a variety of tissue types over the visible spectrum, the absorption coefficient is highly dependent on the nature of the tissue, and the wavelength of light, with each tissue showing a peak absorption in the 500-600 nm range. The relatively low absorption coefficient above about 600 nm is consistent with the spectral data seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, and with the total transmittance data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The second important optical property is the reduced scattering coefficient &mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>of the tissue, which is the fractional decrease in intensity per unit length of penetration of light due to large angle light scattering. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C and 7D</cross-reference>, which plot reduced scattering coefficient for the same tissues over the visible spectrum, scattering effects can be relatively different in different tissues. In general, the reduced scattering coefficient decreases somewhat at longer wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A double integrating sphere (DIS) system is a widely used tool to measure the optical properties of tissue or any turbid medium since it conveniently measures the diffuse reflectance, R<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>, and the diffuse transmittance, T<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>, simultaneously. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> illustrates the double integrating sphere apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> used to measure these values in order to obtain optical properties such as the absorption coefficient, &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, and the reduced scattering coefficient, &mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>(Prahl, S. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Optics </italic></highlight>32:559-568 (1993); Pickering, J. W., et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Optics </italic></highlight>32:399-410 (1993)). The sample <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is placed between the two integrating spheres <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, with internal baffles <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> positioned to prevent measurement of directly reflected or transmitted light. The spheres are coated with a highly reflective material to minimize absorption of light. Light is detected with detectors <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and preferably analyzed using a computer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Sample illumination between 400-1000 nm is achieved using an arc lamp connected to a monochromator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, via a fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> From diffuse reflectance, R<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>, and diffuse transmittance, T<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>, values, the absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients are obtained using the inverse adding-doubling program (http://omic.ogi.edu/software/iad/index.html). This program is a numerical solution to the one speed radiative transport equation, which describes light propagation at steady state in a scattering medium (Prahl, S. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Optics </italic></highlight>32:559-568 (1993)). The program is an iterative process, which estimates the reflectance and transmittance from a set of optical parameters until the calculated reflectance and transmittance match the measured values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A characteristic of the DIS system is the fact that tissues need to be extracted before the measurement. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain tissue viability under measurement conditions. Vascular drainage of hemoglobin and tissue hydration need to be considered, especially at wavelengths where hemoglobin and water absorption are high. Partly in view of the foregoing, a preferred method of measuring tissue optical properties is a non-invasive in vivo measurement, as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A radial fiber probe similar to that described by Bevilacqua (Bevialcqua, F., et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Optics </italic></highlight>38:4939-4950 (1999)) may be used to measure optical properties non-invasively or with minimal invasiveness in vivo. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference> illustrates an experimental set up of a radial fiber probe <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Fiber probe <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> includes an illumination source <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, at least one illumination fiber <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and several (e.g., six) detection fibers <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> generally within a 1-2 mm distance. The probe is then place perpendicularly on a tissue of interest <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, preferably with minimal contact pressure. The output of the detection fibers <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is fed into a set of corresponding detectors <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The optical properties are spatially resolved from intensity versus radial distance from the source. At small source-to-detector separations, simple analytical models such as the diffusion approximations are not well suited to describe the system therefore Monte Carlo methods are typically used to analyze the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> IV. Photon Transport Models </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> This section considers photon-transport models for simulating photon emission at the surface of a body from a light source below the surface and moving through a turbid medium. In particular, it is desired to generate simulated light-intensity spatial profiles based on (i) depth of the light-emitting source, (ii) size of the light-emitting source, and (iii) light-absorption and light-scattering coefficients. Since the light-absorption and light-scattering coefficients are dependent both on wavelength and on the nature of the tissue through which the photons diffuse, the model may be refined to specifically consider the nature of the tissue and the spatial profiles at selected wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The photon-diffusion model employed herein makes a number of simplifying assumptions for purposes of generating an initial light-intensity spatial profile from which initial source-depth and source-size information can be generated, as will be considered in Section V. The model may then be expanded by considering additional tissue-dependent and/or wavelength dependent information to refine the spatial profile, for purposes of improving the curve fit with a measured spatial profile. Alternatively, the initial depth and size information can be refined by other types of curve or data matching. Both approaches for refining the initial depth/size approximation will be considered in Section V below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a photon path as it diffuses through a turbid tissue formed of cells, such as cell <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> containing organelles <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, As seen, the cell size, typically in the 20-30 micron size range, is large relative to the wavelength &lgr; of light, which is between about 0.4 and 0.6 microns. Scattering is due to abrupt discontinuities (&lt;&lt;&lgr;) at membranes and is characterized by an inverse length scattering coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>of about 10-20 mm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The scattering anisotropy g is about 0.9, which gives a reduced scattering coefficient &mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&equals;&mgr;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>(1&minus;g), or about 2 mm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The absorption coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>(&lgr;) is between 0.01 and 1 mm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and as seen above, has a strong wavelength dependence. The absorption and scattering coefficients are wavelength-dependent, but for &lgr;&gt;&tilde;600 nm, it is generally true that &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>&lt;&lt;&mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>in tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A quantitative description of transport of light from a target site within a body to a light detector located adjacent a body surface may be achieved by a solution of a radiative transfer diffusion equation of light with appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., R. C. Haskel; et al in &ldquo;Boundary conditions for the diffusion equation in radiative transfer&rdquo;, J. Optical Soc Am., 11A:2727 (1994)). One approach, for example, uses an extrapolated boundary condition shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> in which optical fluence vanishes at a planar surface that is displaced from the physical boundary at a distance z<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>that takes account of the Fresnel reflection of light at the physical boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As a first approximation, the body in which the light-emitting source is located is represented as a semi-infinite, homogenous turbid medium that is both scattering and absorbing.

The Monte Carlo simulation, shown in &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; symbols in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> closely matches the spatial profile calculated from the diffusion equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> To illustrate how the diffusion equation may be used to model photon diffusion through various tissues and a various depths, the spatial profile was calculated for various values of &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>, corresponding to &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>and &mgr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>values of 2.0 and 20 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, respectively, for &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;11 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>; 0.4 and 10 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, respectively, for &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;3.5 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and 0.05 and 5 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, respectively, for &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.87 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The three values of for &mgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>correspond roughly to tissue absorption for blue, green, and red wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The plots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> show that intensity decreases and spot width increases with increasing depth, and that large values of &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>result in large attenuation of peak intensity with narrower spot width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> V. Determining Depth and Size Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In practicing the method of the invention, the subject is initially treated to localize light-emitting molecules at a target source, as detailed above. The subject is then placed at a selected location within the light-tight chamber of apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (appropriately scaled for subject size) and the optical system is adjusted to measure light emission events from the source at the surface region of the subject between the light-emitting source and the detection optics. With the subject immobilized at a selected optical perspective, a light-intensity spatial profile of surface light emission is obtained, also as described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a surface map of measured light intensity from a subsurface light source, which was subsequently used to generate the spatial profile shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The spatial profile(s) are then fitted with parameter-based biophotonic functions that relate light-emission intensity to depth of a light-emitting source (and in some cases, source size) to obtain an initial determination of source depth (and in some case, source size). One preferred biophotonic function is that derived from the simplified diffusion model discussed in Section IV above, in which light intensity from a point source or source having a defined spherical or ellipsoidal volume is calculated as a function of source depth, fixed scattering and absorption coefficients, and surface distance r from the source. Conventional non-linear least-squares curve fitting techniques, such as Levenberg-Marquardt (&ldquo;Numerical Recipes in C&rdquo;, Press et al., eds, Cambridge Press, NY, 1989). are suitable for the curve fitting. Curve fitting can be done using a single 1-dimensional (&ldquo;1-D&rdquo;) profile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of such profiles, or the entire 2-D spatial distribution (e.g., as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). Curve-fitting calculations to the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> (dashed line) indicate a depth of 2.7 mm, which compares well with the estimated actual depth of 2.2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C give another example of how depth and size information can be determined from spatial profiles. The light-emitting source here is a subcutaneous elliptical tumor having actual dimensions in the horizontal and vertical directions of 2.7 mm and 3.2 mm, respectively, and a tumor thickness of 1.5 mm. The horizontal and vertical profiles were (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</cross-reference>, respectively) were fitted with curves generated for an ellipsoid light-emitting source having horizontal and vertical dimensions of 1.3 and 2.4 respectively, a thickness of 1.5 mm, and a depth of 0.4 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The source depth (and optionally, source size) determination from the initial curve fitting can be refined, and source size approximated, by employing additional data whose effect is to refine the parameters of the biophotonic function. The nature of the additional data, and the manner in which it refines the parameters, e.g., depth and size, of the biophotonic function, providing refined depth and source-size information, will now be considered for each of the information types outlined in Section II above, with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> A. 2nd-view information. To obtain 2nd-view data, the subject is rotated with respect to the viewing and detection optics for viewing the light-emitting source from another perspective. From this second perspective, a second light intensity profile is obtained, providing a second depth determination with respect to a second subject surface region. By determining the intersection of the source depths at two different surface locations, a more accurate depth and/or source size can be determined. The more views that are obtained, the more accurately depth and source size can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> B. Spectral data. A target&apos;s depth within a body region may be determined, or the target depth refined, by (i) causing the target to emit light at two or more wavelength ranges, and (ii) comparing the differences in each range&apos;s light transmission through the body region, at a surface of the body region, provided that the light in each wavelength range transmits through the body region differently from the light in other wavelength ranges as a function of depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Typical spectral curves (representing total light intensity at the indicated wavelengths) as a function of source depth are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, discussed above. As seen particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> (where the peaks are scaled to the in vitro spectral curve), the ratio of peak height at above 600 nm, e.g., 620 nm, to that the in vitro (zero-depth) peak height, e.g., around 500 nm, increases dramatically as a function of depth. Thus, by generating a spectral curve and determining the ratio of peak heights, typically above and below 600 nm, e.g., 620 nm: 500 nm, accurate depth information based on the wavelength-dependent loss in intensity in turbid tissue, can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A useful formula for determining approximate depth from spectral measurements can be derived from Eq. 4 as follows:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> where d represents depth, &phgr; represents the measured light intensity, &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>represents the empirically determined effective coefficient of attenuation, and D is the empirically determined diffusion coefficient. The subscripts 1 and 2 in the above formula refer to two separate wavelengths at which measurements are made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Using the above formula, depth may be determined from two or more light intensity measurements at different wavelengths or ranges of wavelengths. In one embodiment, the depth may be obtained by executing the following series of steps: (1) Image the bioluminescent cells in vitro as well as in vivo (in the animal) at two wavelengths; (2) Quantify the images by measuring, e.g., the peak intensity or the average (integrated) intensity for each image; (3) Calculate the ratio of the in vivo image data to the in vitro image data at each wavelength; and (4) Calculate the depth using Equation 7 and an effective scattering coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>obtained, e.g., from tissue property measurements. An application of this approach is illustrated in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, it is preferable to have a significantly different value for each &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>. Animal tissue provides such a difference in &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>, due largely to the presence of hemoglobin, which has a large absorption peak just below 600 nm, and relatively low absorption above 600 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the additional spectral data may include one or more spatial profiles taken at one or more selected wavelengths or wavelength ranges. The profile(s) are then compared with model intensity functions generated, for example, from a photon diffusion model above, using wavelength-specific values for the absorption, scattering, and/or effective coefficients, as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In still another application, intensity values can be measured at discrete wavelengths, spaced every 20 nm. The spectral plots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> show green luciferase in cells in PBS solution, and spectral curves for green luciferase localized subcutaneously at a site indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B and in the lungs as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference>. All the curves are normalized to a value of 1 at 700 nm. The ratio of intensities at 560 nm to 620 nm is indicative of depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As noted above, a related aspect of the invention provides a method of determining the depth of a light-emitting source in a subject. In practicing the method, the light emission intensity from the subject at two or more different wavelengths between about 400 and about 1000 nm. The depth of the light-emitting source is determined using the measured light-emission intensities, and information related to the optical properties of the subject, e.g., coefficients of attenuation and diffusion in the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Information relating to the optical properties, e.g., coefficients of attenuation and diffusion in the subject may be obtained by direct measurement of the coefficients in material that is the same or similar to that of the subject. This information, combined with measured intensities at two wavelengths in vitro (zero depth) and in vivo (the depth to be determined) can be applied to Equation 7 to determine the depth of the light source, as described above, and as illustrated in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, optical-properties information may be obtained indirectly, by determining, at two or more different wavelengths, light intensities from a light-emitting source located at each of a two or more of a plurality of depths in tissue or material corresponding to that of the subject. The desired depth determination is then made by matching the measured light intensities, e.g., the ratio of the intensities at the different wavelengths, with the light intensities determined at each of the plurality of depths. In a more specific approach, the spectral profile of light intensities from the light-emitting source may be compared (matched) with each of a plurality of spectral profiles of light intensities from a light-emitting source at each of a plurality of depths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> C. Through-body transmittance data. Through-body transmittance data is obtained as described above, and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B for a small-animal subject. As noted above, the information provides a wavelength dependent light-transmission value through a selected tissue or tissues of a known thickness. Predetermined transmittance data from a number of selected locations in a subject can be used to estimate average whole-body scattering and absorption coefficients at the different subject locations, for purposes of refining the modeled spatial profile, either over the entire visible spectrum, or at selected wavelengths, used for curve fitting to the measured spatial profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> D. Tissue properties data. The tissues property data, such as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>D, typically includes wavelength dependent absorption and scattering coefficients for each of the major body tissues. This data is used, for example, in the above model of photon diffusion, to refine the spatial profiles that would be produced by light transmission through a given tissue, at a given wavelength, typically in the red wavelength. Thus, for example, if the light-emitting source in the subject is muscle, and the spatial profile is taken in the red wavelength, a refined spatial profile generated with the tissue-specific and wavelength-specific absorption coefficient will provide a refined spatial profile curve for curve fitting with the measured curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> E. Simulation data. In another embodiment, a test point or otherwise known-shape light-emitting source may be introduced into a block or slab that simulates turbid tissue. The block can be prepared with various scattering and diffusion coefficients, and various shapes to simulate light-emitting source conditions in a subject. Upon placement of the test point, spectral profiles may be taken from the outer surface of the body region where the test point was placed. This data then is correlated with the actual depth and location of the test point. By moving the test point from point to point within the block, a series of spectral measurements can be made. From this series of spectral measurements, a data file can be assembled to model the spectral responses of different regions within the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> F. Integrated Light Intensity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Summed or integrated light-intensity, as noted above, refers to the light-intensity summed over all or some defined area of the detector array. The integrated light intensity can be compared with the integral of Equation 5 to provide yet another estimate of source depth and brightness. This information can be used in conjunction with the profile information. The integrated light intensity can also be calculated for multiple wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> G. Calibrated-intensity data. In the absence of calibrated intensity data, intensity measurements may vary from camera to camera, and measured values will depend on variable such as field of view, binning, time, and f-stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Absolute calibrated intensity (Section III above), allows one to refine the depth-of-source determination, based on curve fitting to true peak value, and to estimate the number of bioluminescent cells in tissue, as discussed in Section III above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, the invention provides for the integration of other imaging data with the intensity and spatial distribution data to produce greater detail three-dimensional maps of the subject and target located therein. For example, compiled differential light transmission data, such as disclosed above, may be interlaced with coordinate systems derived from other three dimensional imaging systems such as stacked slices of MRI images forming a three dimensional digitized &ldquo;image&rdquo; or coordinate system. Such a coordinate system may then be used to better illustrate the anatomy of the subject for which a target is being identified. In the case where the subject is a laboratory animal such as a rat, such animals are highly uniform in structure from one animal to the next for a given strain. Consequently, a coordinate data, spectral data, and spatial intensity pattern files may be developed by a commercial vendor, and sold for use with simplified detection units such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. If model three-dimensional information is supplied as a data file, then user units do not need to be equipped for three-dimensional scanning and mapping. The two-dimensional images contemplated in the methods and apparatuses disclosed above may be combined with the three-dimensional data files provided by the vendor to yield complete three dimensional information about the size, shape, depth, topology, and location of a target within the subject. </paragraph>

The analysis was performed using data at wavelengths equal to 600 nm and 640 nm using the following steps: (i) the bioluminescent cells were imaged in vitro as well as in vivo at 600 nm and 640 nm; (ii) the images were quantified by measuring the average intensity for each image; (iii) the ratio of the in vivo image data to the in vitro image data were determined at each wavelength; and (iv) the depth was calculated using Equation 7 and an average effective scattering coefficient &mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>estimated from the absorption and scattering coefficients in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
