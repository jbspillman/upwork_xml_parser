<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for multiple mode imaging is disclosed herein. The system is a catadioptric system preferably having an NA greater than 0.9, highly corrected for low and high order monochromatic aberrations. This system uses unique illumination entrances and can collect reflected, diffracted, and scattered light over a range of angles. The system includes a catadioptric group, focusing optics group, and tube lens group. The catadioptric group includes a focusing mirror and a refractive lens/mirror element. The focusing optics group is proximate to an intermediate image, and corrects for aberrations from the catadioptric group, especially high order spherical aberration and coma. The tube lens group forms the magnified image. Different tube lens groups can be used to obtain different magnifications, such as a varifocal tube lens group to continuously change magnifications from 20 to 200&times;. Multiple imaging modes are possible by varying the illumination geometry and apertures at the pupil plane. Imaging modes include bright-field, full sky, ring dark-field, inverted ring dark-field, directional dark-field, double dark-field, Manhattan geometry, confocal bright-field, confocal dark-field, conoscopic, etc. Illumination can enter the catadioptric optical system using an auxiliary beamsplitter or mirror, or through the catadioptric group at any angle from 0 to 85 degrees from vertical. Multiple beams at multiple angles may be used for illumination. The high NA catadioptric system can also have a relayed pupil plane, used to select different imaging modes, providing simultaneous operation of different imaging modes, Fourier filtering, and other pupil shaping operations. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for multiple mode imaging, and more particularly to catadioptric optical systems used for dark field imaging applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> High precision optical instruments and imaging systems used in many different applications must operate effectively and efficiently. To accommodate optical functionality under varied conditions, precision lenses are often employed in different complex combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many different imaging modes exist for optical inspection. These imaging modes include bright field, confocal, and a variety of dark field imaging modes. Typically each different mode requires a different machine. Full inspection of an object, such as a semiconductor wafer, requires several separate very expensive machines. Combining many different imaging modes into one machine can dramatically reduce inspection costs as well as provide performance advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The bright field imaging mode is commonly used in microscope systems. The advantage of bright field imaging is the image produced is readily distinguishable. The size of image features accurately represents the size of object features multiplied by the magnification of the optical system. This technique can be more easily used with image comparison and processing algorithms for computerized object detection and classification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The confocal imaging mode has been successfully used for optical sectioning to resolve the height differences of object features. Most imaging modes have difficulty detecting changes in the height of features. The confocal mode forms separate images of object features at each height of interest. Comparison of the images then shows the relative heights of different features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The dark field imaging mode has been successfully used to detect features on objects. The advantage of dark field imaging is that flat specular areas scatter very little light toward the detector, resulting in a dark image. Any surface features or objects protruding above the object scatter light toward the detector. Thus, in inspecting objects like semiconductor wafers, dark field imaging produces an image of features, particles, or other irregularities on a dark background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Dark field illumination provides a large signal for small features that scatter light. This large signal allows larger pixels to be used for a given feature size, permitting faster object inspections. Fourier filtering can also be used to minimize the repeating pattern signal and enhance the defect signal to noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Each dark field mode consists of a specific illumination scheme and collection scheme such that the scattered and diffracted light collected from the object provides the best signal. Several optical systems have been developed that use different dark field imaging modes including laser directional dark field, double dark field, and central dark ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One prior method for achieving laser directional dark field imaging is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,177,559, issued Jan. 5, 1993 to Batchelder and Taubenblatt and assigned to International Business Machines, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This method uses a collimated beam of monochromatic light to illuminate a semiconductor wafer from outside the objective between an angle of 8 degrees from the horizontal and the numerical aperture, or NA, defined by the imaging objective. Before forming a dark field image, the collected light passes through a Fourier filter to attenuate the spatial frequency components corresponding to repeating array patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This laser directional dark-field method illuminates the wafer outside the NA of the imaging objective. For this reason, the illumination angles are limited to between 8 degrees from the horizontal and the NA defined by the imaging objective. Collection angles are also limited to the range of angles within the NA of the objective. A long working distance objective is necessary to allow access by the laser to the area of interest on the semiconductor wafer. Objectives used in dark field applications of this type are generally limited to NAs less than 0.7, which corresponds to collection angles of only up to 44 degrees from normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another prior method for achieving laser directional dark field imaging is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,442, issued Jun. 27, 1995 to Lin and Scheff and assigned Optical Specialties, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This method uses a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the wafer from inside the optical system, within the NA defined by the objective. If the system will encounter a specific range of defect sizes, the illumination angle on the wafer is chosen so the optical system collects spatial frequencies of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This is a laser directional dark field method wherein the laser illuminates the wafer from inside the NA as defined by the objective. The system uses the same objective pupil plane for injecting the illumination and processing the light collected by the objective. This objective pupil feature seriously limits the types of illumination and Fourier filtering that are possible. Systems using objectives of this type are generally limited to NAs of less than approximately 0.9. This means illumination angles are limited to less than approximately 64 degrees. Illumination at angles above 64 degrees is often necessary to obtain optimum defect sensitivity. This high angle illumination is not possible without a higher NA objective. The available objectives of this type with a high NA have very small fields, relative to that of a lower NA objective. This seriously limits the number of resolvable points in the image and the achievable inspection speed. Another problem with this technique is small amounts of scattered and reflected light from lens elements in this system have the ability to produce noise at levels that compromise the sensitivity. Introducing laser illumination from inside this type of objective can cause a significant amount of scattered and reflected light from the multiple lens surfaces. The system must deal with scattered light from the lenses, illumination beam and the specular reflection from the wafer, which is a tremendous potential problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A third known dark field imaging method designed to detect particles on a periodic patterned object is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,898,471, issued Feb. 6, 1990 to Stonestrom et al. and assigned to Tencor Instruments, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This method uses a single light beam scanned at a shallow angle over the object. The position of the collection system as well as the polarization of the light beam may be arranged to maximize the particle signal compared to the patterned signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> This single beam/shallow angle system uses an off axis collector to image the area of interest onto a detector. The position of the collection system as well as the polarization of the illumination is arranged to maximize the signal scattered by particles. Only a single angular position is used for illumination and another angular position for collection. Such a dark field system uses a single spot to scan across the wafer in conjunction with a single detector. If the system uses a small spot for high sensitivity detection, the inspection speed tends to decrease dramatically. If a larger spot size is used to increase inspection speed, the overall system sensitivity degrades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the practical industrial application for object inspection the scattered and diffracted light is collected from either side of the plane of incidence. Since this dark field mode collects light outside of the plane of incidence, this mode is categorized as double dark field. The double dark field technique often obtains maximum sensitivity when the collection angle is greater than 70 degrees from normal, which is well outside the range of a 0.9 NA objective. This makes the combination of the double dark field mode and other imaging modes such as bright field and laser directional dark field difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Three physical embodiments for performing dark field imaging are presented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> presents a directional dark field system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which illuminates the object <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using a laser beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> directed at a high angle of incidence. Light contacting an anomaly is scattered or diffracted upward through collector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and finally to the image plane <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is side view of a double dark field design system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which illuminates the object <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> using laser beam <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> directed at a relatively low angle of incidence. Collectors <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are mounted at different angles from the laser beam <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, typically 90 degrees. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates a top view of the system with the collectors <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> mounted 180 degrees from one another and 90 degrees from the laser <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Variations of these angles are possible. This provides enhanced collection capability and allows detection of particular object faults. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates a variation of a central dark ground imaging system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, wherein the laser beam <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> passes through the collector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at an approximately perpendicular angle to the object <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The light beam strikes the object and is diverted, depending upon the features encountered, toward various collectors mounted about the object. Four collectors <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have been employed in the past, each at an angle 90 degrees from the nearest collectors, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Different numbers of collectors may be used at various angles depending upon the type of object scanned and the defects. anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The drawbacks of these prior dark field systems are twofold. First, physical limitations tend to restrict the angle at which light beams may be applied to the object, i.e. at either extremely deep or extremely shallow angles. This angular limitation tends to impede a full examination of the object. For example, if a type of defect may be detected best when light is applied at a 45 degree angle, such defects may not be apparent when the illumination source is limited to an angle less than 45 degrees. Secondly, these systems only employ one dark field mode each, which again tends to limit the types of defects which may be detected. Any attempt to combine different dark field imaging systems would be severely inhibited due to physical component placement restrictions and the inherent cost associated with multiple components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With respect to the use of a single imaging mode, different schemes have varying performance advantages. For example, a double dark field arrangement is useful when small particles exist on the object, or rough films are expected to be encountered. Microscratches are best detected using normal incidence illumination and off normal imaging. Grazing incidence and back scattering may be used to detect missing contacts or vias on semiconductor wafers, while full sky mode best address metal grain variations. As the types of defects which may be encountered vary depending on many manufacturing factors, it would be best to inspect object for all of these defects. The problem, however, is that no single mode provides these capabilities, nor is a combination of these modes physically realizable nor economically feasible. Further, the use of multiple arrangements running over different machines negatively effects the scanning, processing, and evaluating time for each specimen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that can incorporate as many imaging modes as possible and still maintain image quality and throughput requirements. Such an apparatus would be based on a high NA catadioptric objective with highly flexible illumination and imaging capabilities. Several prior catadioptric systems have been developed for microscopic inspection. While these systems may have a similar appearance to the present invention, they simply do not have the capability to integrate multiple inspection modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One apparatus previously used for microscopic inspection is the catadioptric bright field imaging system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,031,976, issued Jul. 16, 1991 to Shafer and assigned to KLA Instruments, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The system employs a focusing lens, a field lens, and a spherical mirror to focus and reflect light toward an object and back through an aperture located in the spherical mirror. The broadband aspects of the system disclosed do not directly translate to dark field imaging, but the patent does present an apparatus capable of 0.6 NA broad-band UV imaging for the deep ultraviolet spectral region, i.e. approximately 0.19 to 0.30 micron wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The &apos;976 patent is based on the Schupmann achromatic lens principle, which produces an achromatic virtual image, wherein an achromatic real image is produced from the virtual image using a reflective relay. The lens system is formed from a single glass type, fused silica. A series of lenses and mirrors is used to correct for aberrations and focus the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The system used in the &apos;976 patent is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The system includes an aberration corrector lens group <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for correcting image aberrations and chromatic variation of the image aberrations, a focusing lens <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> for receiving light from he group <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and producing an intermediate image plane at plane <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a field lens <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of the same material as the other lenses placed at the intermediate image plane <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> with a plane mirror back coating <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> whose power and position are selected to correct the primary longitudinal color of the system in conjunction with the focusing lens <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and a spherical mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> located between the intermediate image plane and the thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> for producing a final image <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. Most of the focusing power of the system is due to the spherical mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> which has a small central hole near the intermediate image plane <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to allow light from the intermediate image plane <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to pass through to the thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. The mirror coating <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> on the back of the thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> also has a small central hole <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight> to allow light focused by the spherical mirror <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to pass through to the final image <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The &apos;976 system is a catadioptric objective capable of 0.6 NA, with broad-band UV imaging over a 0.5 mm field. This limited NA and field size does not support high speed inspection with more than one dark field mode. An NA of 0.6 collects only 20% of the available solid angle above the sample object. The maximum field size for this system is 0.5 mm. This limits its maximum pixel size and data collection speed. For example, a system with 0.5 mm field size would only have 25% of the maximum pixel size and data collection speed compared to a system with a 2 mm field size. The thickness of the lens mirror element in the &apos;976 patent prevents the system from being scaled up for larger field sizes. The objective is formed from fused silica and uses a positive fused silica field lens near the intermediate image to correct for low order lateral color. The thick lens mirror element is also used in the catadioptric group to compensate the chromatic variation in aberrations of the external lens group. This broad band objective also has no provision for laser illumination through the catadioptric elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,229 to Elliott and Shafer and the associated continuation in part application, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference, provide a modified version of the optical system of the &apos;976 patent, one which has been optimized for use in 0.193 micron wavelength high power excimer laser applications such as ablation of a surface <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>&prime; as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This system has an aberration corrector group <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>&prime;, focusing lens <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>&prime;, intermediate focus <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>&prime;, field lens <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>&prime; thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>&prime;, mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>&prime; with small central opening <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>&prime; therein and a final focus <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>&prime; as in the prior &apos;976 patent, but repositions the field lens <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>&prime; so that the intermediate image or focus <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>&prime; lies outside of the field lens <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>&prime; to avoid thermal damage from the high power densities produced by focusing the excimer laser light. Further, both mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed on lens elements <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>&prime;. The combination of all light passing through both lens elements <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>&prime; provides primary longitudinal color correction of the single thick lens <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but with a reduction in total glass thickness. Since even fused silica begins to have absorption problems at the very short 0.193 micron wavelength, the thickness reduction is advantageous at this wavelength for high power levels. Though the excimer laser source used for this optical system has a relatively narrow spectral line width, the dispersion of silica near the 0.193 micron wavelength is great enough that some color correction is still needed. Again, the system has a numerical aperture of about 0.6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,717,518 to Shafer, Chuang, and Tsai and the associated continuation-in-part application describe a catadioptric objective capable of high NA, ultra broad-band UV bright field imaging. This is a 0.9 NA system with very tight manufacturing tolerances, primarily due to the broad-band requirements of the design. The broad-band UV nature of the design is due in part to the use of two glass types, calcium fluoride and fused silica. Calcium fluoride has excellent UV transmission properties but it is not necessarily a desirable glass because it is difficult to polish, not mechanically stable, and expensive. Fused silica is a more desirable material because in addition to its good UV transmission it has desirable manufacturing properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system in the &apos;518 patent is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The focusing lens group <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consists of seven elements <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with two of the lenses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> separated from the remaining lens elements. These two lenses form a nearly zero power doublet for the correction of chromatic variation of monochromatic imaging aberrations. The five lenses <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> form the main focusing subgroup. The subgroup focuses the light to an intermediate image <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The curvature and positions of the lenses in this subgroup are selected to minimize the monochromatic aberrations as well as cooperate with the doublet <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to minimize chromatic variations of those aberrations. The field lens group <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> typically composes an achromatic triplet. Both fused silica and calcium fluoride glass materials are used. The catadioptric group <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a meniscus lens <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with a concave reflective surface coating <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. It also includes a second optical element consisting of a lens element <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with a reflective surface coating <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on a back surface of the lens. The first lens <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a hole <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> centrally formed along the axis of the optical system. Light from the intermediate image <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> passes through the optical aperture <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the first lens <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and then throughout the body of the second lens <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> where it is reflected back by mirror surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The light then returns through the body of <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the body of <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to reflect off surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The light, now strongly convergent, passes through the body of <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and an aperture <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the reflective surface coating to firm the final image <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Common problems with using several of these prior catadioptric optical systems for multiple imaging modes includes: these are complicated systems with tight manufacturing tolerances, they provide no illumination and imaging above 0.9 NA and a field of view less than 1 mm, pupil planes that are not easily accessible, and limited imaging modes and associated illumination schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus which can incorporate as many imaging modes as possible while still meeting image quality and throughput requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the current invention to provide an effective, relatively simple and low cost imaging system having high optical performance and minimal inspection times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the current invention to provide a high numerical aperture imaging system having high optical performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the current invention to provide a system having a pupil plane at a location separate and apart from the lenses of the optical system, and providing the ability to magnify the resultant image over a range of magnification values. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a multiple mode catadioptric imaging method and apparatus for optical inspection. The inventive apparatus disclosed herein can combine the functions of several prior imaging modes and is based on a high NA catadioptric optical design. The system can be a narrow band system preferably having an NA greater than 0.90 that is highly corrected for low and high order monochromatic aberrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The high NA catadioptric design disclosed herein may be used and optimized for light having different wavelengths, from infrared to the deep ultraviolet. For example, in the ultraviolet spectrum, light beams having wavelengths of 193 nm, 213 nm, 244 nm, 248 nm, 257 nm, 266 nm, and so forth are possible using the concepts disclosed herein, with adjustments that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An example of an inventive apparatus that supports multiple mode imaging is disclosed. This apparatus is a 0.97 NA catadioptric optical design having a 1 millimeter field size is that optimized for a 266 nm wavelength and uses only fused silica. The design includes a catadioptric group and a focusing optics group proximate to an intermediate image. Light scattered, diffracted, and reflected by the object is collected by the catadioptric group which forms an intermediate image. The focusing optics group then corrects the aberrations present in the intermediate image. The working distance of the design presented is 0.5 millimeters. The central obscuration is less than to 10% of the pupil diameter, and the system can have a Strehl ratio of better than 0.98 over the entire field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The catadioptric group includes a fused silica single near flat reflector and a dome-shaped reflector arranged in a catadioptric group. The near flat reflector can be a parallel fused silica plate having zero power, thereby making the catadioptric group easy to align. The focusing optics group includes eight lens elements in one embodiment. The focusing optics group corrects for high order spherical aberration and coma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The ultra high NA disclosed allows for a variety of flexible illumination schemes. Illumination angles from 0 to approximately 85 degrees can be easily implemented thereby allowing maximum flexibility when choosing an illumination angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The catadioptric optical system has two primary methods for illumination. First, light energy can enter through the lenses of the optical system at angles between 0 and the collection angle defined by the objective NA. Second, for oblique illumination at angles from about 12 to 85 degrees, the preferred method of is by introducing the illumination through an aperture in the coating of the dome-shaped reflector. Light energy may illuminate the object at angles from 12 to 85 degrees from the normal. With proper mirror design, a beam introduced through an aperture in the mirror coating maintains the same angle with respect to the wafer when it exits the near flat reflector. In addition, the catadioptric group will not add any power to the illumination beam. The aperture required in the mirror coating of the catadioptric group may be a slit of non-mirrored surface where light energy is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Multiple beams at multiple angles may also be used for illumination. For example, two beams separated azimuthally by 90 degrees may be used for illumination to minimize shadowing effects, with appropriate apertures provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The catadioptric imaging system effectively collects light scattered, diffracted, and reflected at different angles by the wafer and maps these scattering angles to a plane. This plane is located at the pupil of the system and each position on this pupil plane corresponds to a position on dome-shaped reflector. Each location in the pupil plane corresponds to different scattering angles, and apertures placed at this pupil plane can be used to limit the range of scattering angles reaching the image detector. This pupil plane roughly corresponds to the Fourier plane of the wafer. Such a system supports collection NAs up to 0.99 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The wide range of illumination and collection angles possible with the system supports multiple imaging modes. These modes include but are not limited to: variable NA bright field, full sky, ring dark field, inverted ring dark field, directional dark field, double dark field, central dark ground, Manhattan geometry, confocal bright field, confocal dark field, and well as conoscopic imaging. Other schemes are possible in which the illumination angle is between 0 and approximately 85 degrees and the collection angle between 0 and approximately 82 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The variable NA bright field imaging mode may be employed using the apparatus disclosed herein. The illumination of the wafer in this system is similar to that in a standard microscope. The light can be injected into the optical system using a beam splitter and then projected through the optical system to the object to be inspected. Variable NA illumination can be obtained by using an aperture at the objective pupil, in the collimated range of the objective, or in separate optics before the beam splitter. The light reflected, scattered, and diffracted from the object returns through the objective and through the beam splitter. Variable NA of the light from the object can be obtained by using an aperture at the objective pupil or in the collimated range of the objective. An image is formed on a detector using additional lenses as described in the embodiments below. Such a bright field imaging technique can also operate in full sky mode. In this mode the image contains light scattered at angles up to the maximum possible NA of the objective. The full sky mode is most effective when the collection NA is near 0.99. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the apparatus disclosed herein can operate in ring dark field imaging mode. This is a standard type of dark field imaging where the illumination angles are limited to a high NA ring and the imaging angles are limited to the NAs less than those used by the ring illumination. The ring illumination can be injected into the optical system using a beam splitter. The low NA imaging can be obtained by placing an aperture at the pupil plane of the objective to limit the angles reaching the detector. This system can also operate in inverted ring dark field mode. This mode is the inverse of the previous system and uses low NA bright field illumination and a high NA ring for imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The apparatus disclosed herein can operate in directional dark field imaging mode. This mode uses oblique illumination as described above and can collect scattered light from the object up to the full angular range of the catadioptric objective. Collecting only the desired portion of the scattered and diffracted light is accomplished by using an aperture in the pupil plane or in the collimated range of the objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the apparatus disclosed herein can operate in the double dark field imaging mode. This mode uses oblique illumination and collects the near 90 degree azimuthal portions of the scattered and diffracted light. The system uses an aperture in the pupil plane or in the collimated range to limit the collection to the near 90 degree azimuthal portions of scattered and diffracted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the apparatus disclosed herein can operate in the central dark ground imaging mode. This mode uses normal illumination by directing light through the optical system at an angle from approximately 0 to 12 degrees from the normal of object being inspected. In this mode the specular reflection from the wafer is blocked and remaining portions of the scattered and diffracted light are transferred to the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The apparatus disclosed herein can also operate in the Manhattan geometry imaging mode. This mode can use normal illumination as described in the central dark ground mode or oblique illumination as described in the directional dark field mode. The Manhattan geometry uses high angle light collection from four different quadrants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the inventive system disclosed herein can operate in the bright field confocal imaging mode. This mode takes advantage of the short depth-of-focus obtainable by using a high NA objective and short wavelength illumination. Bright field confocal mode illuminates the object with a single point or a line focus. The illumination spot on the object is then imaged through an aperture in front of a detector. The object, illumination spot, aperture, or a combination thereof are then scanned to collect information about an area on the object being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the system can operate in the dark field confocal imaging mode. The dark field confocal imaging mode also takes advantage of the short depth-of-focus obtainable by using a high NA objective and short wavelength illumination. This unique imaging mode is made possible by the high NA diffraction limited illumination. High NA ring illumination produces a diffraction limited spot or line and the remaining NA can support diffraction limited imaging. The illumination spot on the object is imaged, using an NA that is less than the illumination NA, through an aperture in front of a detector. The object, illumination spot, aperture, or a combination thereof are then scanned to collect information about an area on the object being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the apparatus disclosed herein can operate in the conoscopic imaging mode. This mode can use either oblique or normal illumination, and lenses are not required to form an image on a detector. The light at the pupil plane or in the collimated range of the objective can be placed directly on a single detector, multiple detectors, or detector array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As may be appreciated from the previous paragraphs, the inventive concept disclosed herein is that multiple imaging modes can be implemented using a single ultra high NA optical system or machine. This is possible because of the wide range of illumination and imaging angles supported by this optical system. Illumination angles from 0 to 85 degrees from normal can be easily implemented, thereby allowing maximum flexibility when choosing an illumination angle. Collection angles from 0 to 82 degrees from normal are also possible. Different illumination schemes and different pupil filters are used to select the different imaging modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The narrow band catadioptric optical system disclosed herein may be designed with NAs up to 0.99 in air. The system can also be designed with field sizes of greater than 2 mm. Such a system has relaxed manufacturing tolerances and only requires a single glass material. One embodiment of the system disclosed herein provides increased field size, including up to 4.0 mm of field size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the current design provides a relayed pupil for better access to the Fourier plane. Transferring the pupil to an external plane affords easy simultaneous operation of various imaging schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a tube lens group can be used with any of these objective designs to provide a magnified image of the object being inspected. Different tube lens groups may be used to obtain different magnifications. The tube lens groups can be designed to have, a distant exterior pupil plane to match the buried interior pupil plane of the catadioptric objectives. A tube lens group can also be designed to work with an objective with a relayed pupil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Still another embodiment of the current system is a six element varifocal tube lens group which can be independently corrected from the main system and which provides magnification of the image from 20&times; to 200&times;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of all of the aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art after having read the following detailed disclosure of the preferred embodiments illustrated in the following drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, shown is a figure illustrating an apparatus that combines the functions of several imaging systems. This apparatus, based on a high NA catadioptric optical design, is a narrow band optical system having an NA greater than 0.90 and is highly corrected for low and high order monochromatic aberrations. The system of the present invention may have a numerical aperture of greater than 0.65. Preferably the numerical aperture is greater than 0.90. The field size preferably ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> This high NA catadioptric optical design has been optimized with emphasis on manufacturability and flexibility for a multiple mode optical inspection system. Previous catadioptric systems were primarily optimized for broad band performance. For this reason these prior systems had NAs limited to 0.90 and field sizes limited to 1 mm. Previous designs had a tendency to be highly complicated with tight manufacturing tolerances and required two glass materials, which could add considerable cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The high NA catadioptric optical system disclosed herein may have an NA in air up to 0.99 and a field size of greater than 1 mm. Such a system has relaxed manufacturing tolerances and only requires a single glass material. Use of a single glass material in the catadioptric system is very advantageous when the system is optimized for the spectrum below 300 nm because only a few glasses with high transmission are available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The high NA catadioptric objective disclosed herein may be used and optimized for light beams having different wavelengths, from the infrared to the deep ultraviolet. For example, in the ultraviolet spectrum, light beams having wavelengths of 193 nm, 213 nm, 244 nm, 248 nm, 257 nm, 266 nm, and so forth are possible using the concepts disclosed herein, with adjustments that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For wavelengths from 110-200 nm, fluoride glasses will be used because of their good transmission properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> One of key advantages of this catadioptric optical system is the high quality imaging performance at numerical apertures (NAs) up to 0.99. This NA range represents the capability to illuminate and image at very high angles of incidence. The relationships between the numerical aperture in air and the angle of incidence to the sample are that NA&equals;n * sin(angle of incidence) where the index n has a value of 1.000 for air. The following table summarizes the relation between NA and the angle of incidence in air:

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a 0.97 NA design having a 1 millimeter field size. The design is optimized for a 266 nm wavelength and uses only fused silica. The system has a Strehl ratio of 0.98 and can resolve on the order of 6,000 spots along one dimension of the 1 mm field. As will be discussed below, increased field sizes are achievable using this system. For a 1.5 mm field size, the Strehl ratio decreases to 0.95 and the number of resolvable spots along one dimension of the field increases to approximately 9,000. For a 2.0 mm field size, the Strehl ratio decreases to 0.85 and the number of resolvable spots along one dimension of the field increases further to approximately 12,000. An increase in the number of resolvable spots increases the efficiency for a given configuration and faster inspection of an object is possible. Possible applications of this optical system include wafer and photomask inspection, material masking and cutting operations, UV lithography, biological microscopy, metallurgical microscopy and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Note that the elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are drawn to scale, with the number and line in the upper left corner indicating a distance in millimeters, here 25 millimeters. This notation is used throughout several figures included herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The design in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> includes a catadioptric group <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> proximate to an intermediate image, and a focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Light scattered, diffracted, and reflected by the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is collected by the catadioptric group <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> which forms an intermediate image <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>. The focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> corrects for the aberrations present in the intermediate image. The working distance of the design presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is 0.5 millimeters, or a distance of 0.5 millimeters exists between the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and the single refractive element <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. The central obscuration is limited to 10% of the beam diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, catadioptric group <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> includes near flat reflector with a reflective surface coating <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and a dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The near flat reflector with a reflective surface coating <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> can be a parallel fused silica plate having zero power, thereby making the catadioptric group portion easy to align. Focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> includes first focusing lens element <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>, second focusing lens element <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, third focusing lens element <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, fourth focusing lens element <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, fifth focusing lens element <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, sixth focusing lens element <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, seventh focusing lens element <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>, and eighth focusing lens element <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>. The focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> corrects for high order spherical aberration and coma. The focusing optics group design uses a field lens concept originally developed by Offner, but the Offner design only works for systems having near zero field size. The large fields in these objective designs require unique optimization techniques. The complexity and shapes of the lenses in the focusing group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> become extremely critical for high NA values, such as those exceeding 0.90, and for large field sizes. This design has been chosen to minimize the incidence angles of the light on the lens surfaces which can minimize reflection losses and improve tolerance sensitivities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The ultra high NA disclosed allows for a variety of flexible illumination schemes. Illumination angles from 0 to 85 degrees can be easily implemented, thereby allowing maximum flexibility when choosing an illumination angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The catadioptric optical system has two primary methods for illumination. First, light energy can enter through the lenses of the optical system at angles from 0 to the angle defined by the objective NA. Second, for oblique illumination at angles from about 12 to 85 degrees, the preferred method is by introducing the illumination through an aperture in the coating of the dome-shaped reflector as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As a result, illuminating light only passes through a few surfaces, thereby reducing the potential for multiple surface reflection and scattering to reach the imaging detector. As shown therein, a beam introduced through an aperture in the mirror coating <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> maintains the same angle with respect to the wafer <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> when it exits the objective. In other words, illumination introduced at an angle of 85 degrees to the normal <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> exits the fused silica single refractive element <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> at the same 85 degree angle. For the lens design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the dimensions for the catadioptric group to provide uniform angles of incidence are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The thickness of fused silica near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is 14.51 mm with a diameter of 170 mm. The dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> has an inner radius of curvature of 75.8 mm, and an outer radius of curvature of 91.5 mm. The distance on the centerline between the inner edge and the outer edge of the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is 12 mm, and the distance from the inner edge of the dome-shaped reflector to the fused silica near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is 47.46 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> If the design is reoptimized by changing the thickness or radius of curvature of the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> or the inner radius of the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, the thickness and/or outer radius of curvature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> of dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> should be modified to preserve the angle of illumination. Under oblique illumination, in addition to preserving the angle when a beam enters and exits the objective, the catadioptric elements do not introduce any power to the illumination beam. A collimated beam of light energy entering through an aperture in a mirror coating will be collimated when it exits the objective. The aperture in coating of the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> may include a slit of non-mirrored surface, single holes of non-mirrored surface, a physical hole in the mirror, a partial mirror coating, or a coating that selectively transmits the wavelength of interest. In addition, multiple beams at multiple angles may also be used for illumination. For example, using oblique illumination, two beams separated azimuthally by approximately 90 degrees may be used for illumination to minimize shadowing effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The catadioptric imaging system effectively collects light scattered, diffracted, and reflected at different angles by the object and maps these scattering angles to a plane. This plane is located at the pupil of the system and each position on this pupil plane corresponds to a position on the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Each location in the pupil plane corresponds to different scattering angles, and apertures placed at this pupil plane can be used to limit the range of scattering angles reaching the image detector. This pupil plane roughly corresponds to the Fourier plane of the object. Such a system supports collection NAs up to 0.99 for illumination angles between 0 and 85 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The wide range of illumination and collection angles possible with this catadioptric optical system allows it to support multiple imaging modes. These modes include, but are not limited to, variable NA bright field, full sky, ring dark field, inverted ring dark field, directional dark field, double dark field, central dark ground, Manhattan geometry, confocal bright field, confocal dark field, as well as conoscopic imaging. Many other schemes are also possible in which the illumination angle is between 0 and approximately 85 degrees and the collection angle between 0 and approximately 82 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Variable NA bright field mode may be employed using the inventive concepts disclosed herein. The illumination of the object in this system is similar to that in a standard microscope. The light may be injected into the optical system using a beam splitter and then projected through the focusing group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Light energy then passes through the aperture in the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and strikes the reflective surface on near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. Light energy then passes back through the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, striking dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, passing once again through the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> to illuminate object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Note that the right surface of the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is necessarily clear, or non-opaque, at the center portion such that light may contact object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> but has a reflective interior surface outside the center portion to provide reflectivity. Variable illumination NA can be obtained by using an aperture at the objective pupil plane, in the collimated range of the objective, or in separate optics before the beam splitter. The light passes through the objective and is then scattered, diffracted, and reflected from the object. The light from the object returns through the objective and through the beam splitter. The variable NA of the light from the object can be obtained by using an aperture at the objective pupil plane or in the collimated range of the objective. An image is formed on a detector using additional lenses as described in the embodiments below. The optical system described obtains optimum performance when narrow band illumination is used. Therefore, the bright field illumination in this system could be a narrow band laser or a broad band source with a narrow band filter. To reduce the problem of speckle and interference from narrow band light, a moving ground glass or some other technique to introduce random phase can be placed into the beam before light enters the objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the inventive system disclosed herein can operate in full sky mode. This mode is a variation of the variable NA bright field mode described above. Full Sky uses the same type of variable NA illumination, however, the NA of the light collected from the object should be as large as possible. Imaging in this mode collects as much light as possible coming from the object, especially in the higher angles. This mode helps minimize contrast variations introduced by grain and rough films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The system can also operate in ring dark field mode. This is a standard type of dark field imaging where the illumination angles are limited to a high NA ring and the imaging angles are limited to the NAs less than those used by the ring illumination. The ring illumination can be injected into the optical system using a beam splitter. The ring illumination can be formed by a ring reflector or by separate illumination optics previous to a beam splitter. To form the high NA ring in the separate illumination optics an aperture can be placed at an equivalent pupil plane. This method of forming the ring illumination has the drawback that the aperture blocks a substantial portion of the light. To avoid this, the ring can be formed by using one or more axicons, a diffractive optic, a holographic optic, a segmented optic, combinations of these devices, and so forth. The low NA imaging can be obtained by placing an aperture at the pupil plane of the objective to limit the angles reaching the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the system can operate in inverted ring dark field mode. This mode is the inverse of the previous system and uses the low NA&apos;s for illumination and a high NA ring for imaging. Variable low NA illumination can be obtained by using a low NA spot mirror or separate illumination optics before the beam splitter as described in the variable NA bright field section above. The high NA imaging can be obtained by placing an aperture at the pupil plane of the objective or in the collimated range to limit the angles reaching the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The system can also operate in directional dark field mode using oblique illumination, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Such an implementation can collect scattered and diffracted light from the object at variable NAs from the near normal portion of light to the full angular range of the catadioptric objective. In the directional dark field mode, the system illuminates the object by injecting the illuminating beam through an aperture in the mirror coating shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Illumination source <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> emits a beam of light to lens <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, which collimates the beam and transmits the beam to mirror <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. Mirror <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> directs the collimated beam through the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, striking the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The specular reflection from object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is transmitted out of the system through another aperture in the coating of the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The scattered and diffracted light from the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is collected by the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The dome dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> then reflects the light to lens mirror element <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> which in turn reflects the light to the imaging lenses in the system. Limiting the collection angles&equals;of the scattered and diffracted light is accomplished by using an aperture in the pupil plane or in the collimated range of the objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Apertures of any size may be used from large apertures that transmit the full NA of the system to small apertures that transmit only the near normal light. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is an example of a pupil aperture <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> that allows imaging light to pass through the central region <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and blocks light outside this area with annular block. Such an aperture can be used to limit collection angles to those less than the illumination angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The system can further operate in double dark field mode using the oblique illumination and collecting the near 90 degree azimuthal portions of scattered and diffracted light. In the double dark field mode, the system illuminates the object by injecting the illumination through an aperture in the mirror coating as is done in the directional dark field case. The system uses an aperture in the pupil plane or in the collimated range to limit the collection to the near 90 degree azimuthal portions of scattered and diffracted light. Such a collection aperture may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The aperture <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> has two apertures <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> which collect the near 90 degree azimuthal scattering of a double dark field system such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the system can operate in the central dark ground mode using normal illumination illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, illumination source <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> emits a beam of light to lens <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, which compensates for the power in the Focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and transmits the beam to mirror <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>. Mirror <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> directs the beam toward a spot mirror <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, which directs the beam through the focusing optics group <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and into the catadioptric group <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The beam strikes the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> at an angle from approximately 0 to 12 degrees from the normal of the near flat reflector <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> then strikes the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The scattered, diffracted, and reflected light from the object <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is collected by the dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The dome-shaped reflector <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> then reflects the light to lens mirror element <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> which in turn reflects the light to the imaging lenses in the system. In this mode the specular reflection from the object is blocked and remaining portions of the scattered and diffracted light are transferred to the detector. The specular reflection can be blocked by the spot mirror <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> or by an aperture placed in the pupil plane or the collimated range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The system can also operate in the Manhattan geometry mode. This mode can use normal illumination as described in the central dark ground mode or oblique illumination as described in the directional dark field mode. The Manhattan geometry uses high angle light collection from four different quadrants. An aperture that provides this type of collection may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a filter <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> having four apertures <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> for capturing high angle scattering in portions of the four separate quadrants. Such a filter may be used in connection with a system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the inventive system disclosed herein can operate in the bright field confocal imaging mode. This mode takes advantage of the short depth-of-focus obtainable by using a high NA objective and short wavelength illumination. Bright field confocal mode illuminates the object with a single point or a line focus. The illumination spot on the object is then imaged through an aperture in front of a detector. This aperture and detector can be a pinhole and a single point detector, in the case of a single point focus, or a slit and a linear detector array, in the case of a line focus. The object, illumination spot, aperture, or a combination thereof are then scanned to collect information about an area on the object being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the system can operate in the dark field confocal imaging mode. The dark field confocal imaging mode also takes advantage of the short depth-of-focus obtainable by using a high NA objective and short wavelength illumination. This is a unique imaging mode is made possible by the high NA diffraction limited illumination. High NA ring illumination produces a diffraction limited spot or line and the remaining NA can support diffraction limited imaging. For example, the illumination can occupy a ring from 0.9 to 0.97 NA and the NA up to 0.9 can be used for imaging. The illumination spot on the object is imaged, using an NA that is less than the illumination NA, through an aperture in front of a detector. This aperture and detector can be a pinhole and a single point detector, in the case of a single point focus, or a slit and a linear detector array, in the case of a line focus. The object, illumination spot, aperture, or a combination thereof are then scanned to collect information about an area on the object being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The system can alternately operate in the conoscopic mode. In this mode oblique illumination is used as described above in the section on directional dark field or normal illumination can be used as described in relation to central dark ground mode. In this mode lenses are not required to form an image on a detector. The light at the pupil plane or in the collimated range of the objective can be placed directly on a single detector, multiple detectors, or a detector array. An aperture that limiting the range of angles reaching the detector can also be used at the pupil plane or in the collimated range prior to the detector. The portions of the pupil plane that are most sensitive to the features of interest can be selected for detection. This signal is then be compared to other similar signals form similar objects to detect changes in the features on the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As may be appreciated from the previous paragraphs, the inventive concept disclosed herein is that multiple imaging modes can be implemented using a single optical system or machine. The ultra high NA disclosed for illumination and collection permits the implementation of imaging modes using the same optical system, thereby allowing optimization of imaging for different types of defects or samples. Illumination angles from 0 to 85 degrees can be easily implemented, thereby allowing maximum flexibility when choosing an illumination angle. Collection angles from 0 to 82 degrees are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Further, it should be noted that oblique dark field illumination through the dome-shaped reflector in the modes disclosed herein does not interfere with image pupil filtering. This dark field illumination can be achieved through an aperture in the mirror coating with the entrance angle being the same angle striking the object. This feature permits the illumination and imaging pupils to be separate from one another, and thus the illumination and imaging pupil do not interfere with one another. The unique oblique illumination scheme used in the different dark field modes renders the catadioptric system disclosed herein much more flexible with respect to desired illumination schemes and aperturing and filtering techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are some examples of different pupil apertures that may be used to select different imaging modes. As with all mode selection apertures illustrated, these may be fabricated from a section of clear glass with appropriate portions, such as annular block <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, screened out using an opaque material, such as paint or other non-transparent material. Other means of forming such filters, such as using metal or composite material, may be used while still within the scope of the current invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal device, micro-mirror array, or some other addressable array device can be used to segment the pupil. For example, a liquid crystal array can be placed at the pupil plane. Portions of the array can be made opaque and other portions transparent to correspond to the desired pupil aperture, such as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The dimensions for the system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are as follows, where the surface numbers 0 through 26 track the surfaces and gaps the light passes through and reflects off in performing the different imaging modes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> This is an all fused silica design with a 0.97 NA, 1.0 mm field size, and a 15.46 mm focal length. This design is for use at a wavelength of 0.266 micrometers where the index of fused silica is 1.499776.

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment of the system is optimized for use at 0.97 NA with a 4 mm field of view. Note that the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> uses the same basic configuration as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, using a catadioptric group <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> and a focusing group <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. As may be appreciated from the figure and the following table, the system components or surfaces are similar to the previous 1 mm field size systems, with some slightly differing surface curvatures and spatial separations between the elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> An example of an imaging system having increased field size is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. As shown therein, nine lenses <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1717</bold></highlight> contribute with a catadioptric group to increase field size to 4.0 mm for a 0.97 NA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Aperture stop <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> is located halfway through the lens arrangement. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the ray spacing is unequal in the middle of the design, although the rays become equally spaced at the left side of the lens arrangement. This illustrates the one-to-one correspondence between the rays in the dome and the output plane. This ray spacing provides higher order correction capability. As the lens arrangement causes the ray spacing to be unequal on the strongly curved ninth surface (left surface on lens <highlight><bold>1713</bold></highlight>), the rays encounter more spherical aberration on the ninth surface than normal, towards the edge of the aperture, and thereby provide the higher order spherical aberration needed to compensate for the catadioptric elements. The system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> has a Strehl ratio ranging from 0.50 to 0.73 over the 4.0 mm field size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of the system is an all fused silica design with a 0.97 NA, 4.0 mm field size, and a 17.53 mm focal length. This design is for use at a wavelength of 0.266 micrometers where the index of fused silica is 1.499776. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Yet a further embodiment of the current design provides an external pupil plane conjugate to the internal pupil plane of the objective as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. This pupil plane will exactly correspond to the Fourier plane of the object because it is also in the collimated range of the objective. This external pupil plane allows for improved access to the Fourier plane for filtering and aperturing. This makes this embodiment ideally suited for supporting the various imaging modes described previously. The pupil plane is relayed, using a series of lenses <highlight><bold>1809</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1818</bold></highlight> to an external plane <highlight><bold>1808</bold></highlight>. Note that the lenses <highlight><bold>1809</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1818</bold></highlight> have different components but are similar to the lens arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 15</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The greatest differences are the dimension and positions of lenses <highlight><bold>1809</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1816</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1817</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1818</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> These specific dimensions and positions are addressed below. The design has a 0.97 NA, 1.0 millimeter field diameter, and 0.5 millimeter working distance. The relayed pupil arrangement shown has a Strehl ratio greater than 0.90 and in the configuration shown a focal length of 12.37 millimeters. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Transferring the pupil to an external plane affords easy simultaneous operation of various dark field schemes. For example, double dark field and directional dark field can be performed using the system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is based on the catadioptric objective with a relayed pupil. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the catadioptric system <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> employs a laser for oblique illumination as shown by laser beam <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>. Scattered, diffracted, and reflected light collected from the object is filtered at the pupil plane by a filter <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> similar to a composite of the filters illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. The light beam <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> passing through the central opening in the pupil filter <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> corresponds to the directional dark field scheme, while light passing through the outer openings of pupil filter <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> corresponds to the double dark field scheme. Light energy for these two different dark field schemes may be separated using a plate <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> having a reflective central spot <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> and directed to separate detectors. Other simultaneous schemes are also possible and within the scope of the current invention, such as normal incidence dark field imaging using oblique and near normal collection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Other methods of pupil shaping may be employed while still within the scope of the current invention. For example, pupil shaping may create simultaneous operation with different dark field schemes. A diffractive optic, segmented optic, or other device can be placed at or near the pupil plane to direct different portions of the pupil to different locations. Multiple detectors or a single scanned detector can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, a tube lens group can be used with the 0.97, 0.98, and 0.99 NA objectives in systems having a 1.0 mm field size. The tube lens group has the same 30 mm collimated beam diameter as used in those designs as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 15</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is designed for the single wavelength of 0.266 micrometers. The tube lens group magnifies the 1.0 mm field size of the objectives onto a 36 mm detector. In accordance with other embodiments disclosed herein, the tube lens group is designed to have a distant exterior pupil plane to match the buried interior pupil of the catadioptric objectives. A similar tube lens group can also be designed to work with objectives that have a larger field of view or a relayed pupil. The Strehl ratio of the tube lens group design is approximately 0.99 over the field. A more complicated tube lens group design is necessary for use with the larger field size objective due not only to larger field size but also to the lower magnification if the same size detector is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The tube lens group is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and includes lenses <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight> as well as focal plane <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight>. A tube lens group having focal length of 555.6 mm and an NA of 0.027 will have the following dimensions for 0.97, 0.98, and 0.99 NA objectives for a wavelength of 0.266 micrometers and a 30 mm beam diameter:

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Still another embodiment of the current system uses a six element varifocal tube lens group for 20&times; to 200&times; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and which can be independently corrected from the main system and which provides magnification and transposition from the pupil plane. At the edge of the 38 millimeter detector, for a 20&times; magnification, the Strehl ratio for a 0.266 micrometer wavelength is 0.955. This value improves over the rest of the detector and at magnifications greater than 20&times;. Worst case distortion from 20&times; to 200&times; is 0.06 percent. The nearest distance from a lens to the detector is 149 millimeters, and this distance increases by 777 millimeters in extending the magnification from 20&times; to 200&times;. The motion of the moving group of four lenses, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is 160 mm. Note that both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate the varifocal tube lens group at 20&times; magnification. </paragraph>

It may also be desirable to use this type of a varifocal tube lens group with an objective that does not have a relayed pupil. This is possible using the concepts disclosed herein, with adjustments that would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> This design is for use at 0.266 micrometers where the refractive index of fused silica is 1.49968. For the 20&times; magnification the system has focal length of 153 mm and an NA of 0.049. The dimensions are as follows:
