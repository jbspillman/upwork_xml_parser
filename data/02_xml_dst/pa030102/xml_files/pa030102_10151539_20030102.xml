<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119(a) to European Patent Application Serial No. 01870108.6, filed May 22, 2001 (Attorney Docket No. CM2571F). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a pouch composition. In particular, this invention relates to a pouch composition with improved dissolution characteristics. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cleaning/care compositions come in a number of product forms, such as granules, liquids, tablets, and pouches each form having its own advantages and disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, water-soluble pouches containing washing, cleaning or care actives has become popular. In general, the pouches comprise a liquid or powder detergent composition surrounded by a water-soluble film, such a polyvinyl alcohol. These products have the advantage that they are convenient to dose, easy to handle and cause little mess in comparison with traditional detergent forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Detergent pouch composition can be dosed directly into the drum or through the dosing drawer. Either way, the composition must be able to disintegrate quickly and completely in order to avoid residue being left in the drawer or in the wash drum. Prior art compositions often do not dissolve as rapidly or as fully as desired. The problem is particularly severe in detergent compositions where, it is believed, that the surfactant molecules pack around the surface of the film preventing rapid dissolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that the reliability of the dissolution of the pouch compositions is improved with compositions comprising cyclic hydrotropes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the dissolution of the film material can be retarded by interactions between the actives, such as fabric softening agents or surfactants, and the surface of the film. It is thought that the cyclic hydrotropes of the present invention disrupt this interaction and thus allow for the more rapid dissolution of the film. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pouch composition wherein the pouch is constructed from a water-soluble film and contains a composition comprising a cyclic hydrotrope. The present invention also relates to methods of producing such a pouch composition and to methods of treatment using such a composition. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of a cyclic hydrotrope for aiding the dissolution of a water-soluble pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the cyclic hydrotrope has been found to assist the dissolution of PVA pouches in automatic washing machines in the presence of heavy duty liquid laundry detergent ingredients. This includes such dissolution at low wash temperatures (e.g., 5-30&deg; C.), low water levels (as in wool cycles or crease cycles) short washing times (e.g., 5-50 min.) and in the presence of large amounts of laundry (for example when the washing machine is &ldquo;stuffed&rdquo; with laundry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A hydrotrope is a substance with the ability to increase the solubility of certain slightly soluble organic compounds. A description of hydrotropes can be found in Surfactant Science, Vol. 67 &ldquo;Liquid Detergents&rdquo;, 1997 in Chapter 2 entitled &ldquo;Hydrotropy&rdquo;. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The pouch herein is typically a closed structure, made of materials described herein, enclosing a volume space. The pouch comprises a composition which can be in any suitable form. The composition must comprise a cyclic hydrotropes. These elements will be described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The pouch and volume space thereof, can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable to hold the composition, e.g. without allowing the release of the composition from the pouch prior to contact of the pouch to water. The exact execution will depend on for example the type and amount of the composition in the pouch, the number of compartments in the pouch, the characteristics required from the pouch to hold, protect and deliver or release the compositions. Preferably, the pouch has a spheroid shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferred compositions for use in the present invention are cleaning compositions, fabric care compositions, or hard surface cleaners, more preferably laundry or dish washing compositions including, pre-treatment or soaking compositions and other rinse additive compositions. Particularly preferred are laundry detergent compositions, especially liquid detergent compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The pouch may be of such a size that it conveniently contains either a unit dose amount of the composition herein, suitable for the required operation, for example one wash, or only a partial dose, to allow the consumer greater flexibility to vary the amount used, for example depending on the size and/or degree of soiling of the wash load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The pouch herein can also comprise multiple compartments containing any combination of detergent compositions. If the pouch comprises multiple compartments they will typically be closed structures made of a water-soluble film which encloses a volume space which comprises the components of the detergent composition. Said volume space is preferably enclosed by a water-soluble film in such a manner that the volume space is separated from the outside environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Water-Reactive Film </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The pouch is typically made from a water-soluble film. It is preferred that the pouch as a whole comprises material which is water-dispersible or more preferably water-soluble. Preferred water-soluble films are polymeric materials, preferably polymers which are formed into a film. The material in the form of a film can for example be obtained by casting, blow-moulding, extrusion or blow extrusion of the polymer material, as known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The water-soluble films for use herein typically have a solubility of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by the method set out hereinafter using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 50 microns, namely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Gravimetric method for determining water-solubility of the material of the compartment and/or pouch: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 50 grams &plusmn;0.1 gram of material is added in a 400 ml beaker, whereof the weight has been determined, and 245 ml&plusmn;1 ml of distilled water is added. This is stirred vigorously on magnetic stirrer set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with the pore sizes as defined above (max. 50 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method, and the weight of the remaining polymer is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the percentage solubility or dispersability can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It may be preferred that the water soluble film and preferably the pouch as a whole is stretched during formation and/or closing of the pouch, such that the resulting pouch is at least partially stretched. This is to reduce the amount of film required to enclose the volume space of the pouch. When the film is stretched the film thickness decreases. The degree of stretching indicates the amount of stretching of the film by the reduction in the thickness of the film. For example, if by stretching the film, the thickness of the film is exactly halved then the stretch degree of the stretched film is 100%. Also, if the film is stretched so that the film thickness of the stretched film is exactly a quarter of the thickness of the unstretched film then the stretch degree is exactly 200%. Typically and preferably, the thickness and hence the degree of stretching is non-uniform over the pouch, due to the formation and closing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of using stretching the pouch, is that the stretching action, when forming the shape of the pouch and/or when closing the pouch, stretches the pouch non-uniformly, which results in a pouch which has a non-uniform thickness. This allows control of the dissolution of water-soluble pouches herein, and for example sequential release of the components of the detergent composition enclosed by the pouch to the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pouch is stretched such that the thickness variation in the pouch formed of the stretched water-soluble film is from 10 to 1000%, preferably 20% to 600%, or even 40% to 500% or even 60% to 400%. This can be measured by any method, for example by use of an appropriate micrometer. Preferably the pouch is made from a water-soluble film that is stretched, said film has a stretch degree of from 40% to 500%, preferably from 40% to 200%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The film preferably has a thickness of from 1 &mgr;m to 200 &mgr;m, more preferably from 15 &mgr;m to 150 &mgr;m, even more preferably from 30 &mgr;m to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Preferred polymer copolymers or derivatives thereof are selected from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatine, natural gums such as xanthum and carragum. More preferably the polymer is selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, most preferably polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferably, the level of polymer in the film, for example a PVA polymer, is at least 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The polymer can have any weight average molecular weight, preferably from about 1000 to 1,000,000, or even form 10,000 to 300,000 or even form 15,000 to 200,000 or even form 20,000 to 150,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Mixtures of polymers can also be used. This may in particular be beneficial to control the mechanical and/or dissolution properties of the compartment or pouch, depending on the application thereof and the required needs. For example, it may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is present in the material of the compartment, whereby one polymer material has a higher water-solubility than another polymer material, and/or one polymer material has a higher mechanical strength than another polymer material. It may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is used, having different weight average molecular weights, for example a mixture of PVA or a copolymer thereof of a weight average molecular weight of 10,000 to 40,000, preferably around 20,000, and of PVA or copolymer thereof, with a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to 300,000, preferably around 150,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also useful are polymer blend compositions, for example comprising hydrolytically degradable and water-soluble polymer blend such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, achieved by the mixing of polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, typically comprising 1-35% by weight polylactide and approximately from 65% to 99% by weight polyvinyl alcohol, if the material is to be water-dispersible, or water-soluble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It may be preferred that the polymer present in the film is from 60-98% hydrolysed, preferably 80% to 90%, to improve the dissolution of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Most preferred films are films which comprise a PVA polymer with similar properties to the film which comprises a PVA polymer and is known under the trade reference M8630, as sold by Chris-Craft Industrial Products of Gary, Ind., US. Another preferred film is known under the trade reference PT-75, sold by Aicello Chemical Europe GmbH, Carl-Zeiss-Strasse 43, 47445 Moers, DE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The film herein may comprise other additive ingredients than the polymer or polymer material. For example, it may be beneficial to add plasticisers, for example glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof, additional water, disintegrating aids. It may be useful when the composition herein is a detergent composition, that the film itself comprises a detergent additive to be delivered to the wash water, for example organic polymeric soil release agents, dispersants, dye transfer inhibitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The pouch herein comprises a composition, typically said composition is contained in the volume space of the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Unless stated otherwise all percentages herein are weight percent of the final composition excluding the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pouch comprises a composition which can be in any suitable form such as a liquid, a gel, a solid, or a powder. Preferably, the pouches of the present invention comprise a liquid, a gel, or a powder. More preferably the pouches of the present invention comprise a liquid. If the pouch has multiple compartments the compartments may contain any combination of detergent compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The composition can be cleaning compositions, fabric care compositions, or hard surface cleaners, more preferably laundry or dish washing compositions including, pre-treatment or soaking compositions and other rinse additive compositions. Particularly preferred are laundry detergent compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Cyclic Hydrotropes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The composition of the present invention must comprise a cyclic hydrotrope. Any suitable cyclic hydrotrope may be used. However, preferred hydrotropes are selected from salts of cumene sulphonate, xylene sulphonate, naphthalene sulphonate, p-toluene sulphonate, and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred are salts of cumene sulphonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the sodium form of the hydrotrope is preferred, the potassium, ammonium, alkanolammonium, and/or C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkyl substituted ammonium forms can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An especially preferred cyclic hydrotrope for use herein is sodium cumene sulphonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferably the compositions herein comprise from 0.01% to 30%, more preferably from 0.1% to 20%, even more preferably from 0.25% to 10%, even more preferably still from 0.5% to 5%, by weight of composition, of hydrotrope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>Polyols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The compositions herein may contain a number of optional ingredients. One highly preferred optional ingredient is a C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>polyol wherein at least two polar groups that are separated from each other by at least 5, preferably 6, carbon atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the polyols of the present invention have from 5 to 12, more preferably from 5 to 10, even more preferably from 6 to 8, carbon atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from 0.01% to 15%, more preferably from 0.1% to 10%, even more preferably from 0.25% to 7%, even more preferably still from 0.5% to 5%, by weight of composition, of C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>polyol. </paragraph>

Preferably the polyols of the present invention have from 2 to 6, more preferably from 2 to 4, even more preferably 2, hydroxy groups per molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferred C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>polyols include:

For example, they improve the rheology of liquid detergent compositions. It is often difficult to incorporate ethoxylated quaternized amine materials into detergent compositions containing anionic surfactant because the ethoxylated quaternized amine material causes the anionic surfactant to precipitate out of the liquid phase causing the liquid detergent composition to thicken considerably.

Origin can further be mesophilic or extremophilic (psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, thermophilic, barophilic, alkalophilic, acidophilic, halophilic, etc.). Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Nowadays, it is common practice to modify wild-type enzymes via protein/genetic engineering techniques in order to optimize their performance efficiency in the detergent compositions of the invention. For example, the variants may be designed such that the compatibility of the enzyme to commonly encountered ingredients of such compositions is increased. Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the optimal pH, bleach or chelant stability, catalytic activity and the like, of the enzyme variant is tailored to suit the particular cleaning application. In regard of enzyme stability in liquid detergents, attention should be focused on amino acids sensitive to oxidation in the case of bleach stability and on surface charges for the surfactant compatibility. The isoelectric point of such enzymes may be modified by the substitution of some charged amino acids. The stability of the enzymes may be further enhanced by the creation of e.g. additional salt bridges and enforcing metal binding sites to increase chelant stability. Furthermore, enzymes might be chemically or enzymatically modified, e.g. PEG-ylation, cross-linking and/or can be immobilized, i.e. enzymes attached to a carrier can be applied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> A piece of plastic is placed in a mould to act as a false bottom. The mould consists of a cylindrical shape and has a diameter of 45 mm and a depth of 25 mm. A 1 mm thick layer of rubber is present around the edges of the mould. The mould has some holes in the mould material to allow a vacuum to be applied. With the false bottom in place the depth of the mould is 12 mm. A piece of Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed on top of this mould and fixed in place. A vacuum is applied to pull the film into the mould and pull the film flush with the inner surface of the mould and the false bottom. 50 ml of the liquid component of a detergent composition is poured into the mould. Next, a second piece of Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed over the top of the mould with the liquid component and sealed to the first piece of film by applying an annular piece of flat metal of an inner diameter of 46 mm and heating that metal under moderate pressure onto the ring of rubber at the edge of the mould to heat-seal the two pieces of film together to form a compartment comprising the liquid component. The metal ring is typically heated to a temperature of from 135&deg; C. to 150&deg; C. and applied for up to 5 seconds. </paragraph>
