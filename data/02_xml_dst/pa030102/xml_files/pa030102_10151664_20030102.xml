<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to substrate and semiconductor wafer preparation systems and methods, and more particularly, the present invention relates to the cleaning and drying of substrates and semiconductor wafers implementing a surface tension reducing process and employing space and process efficient systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of semiconductor devices, there is a need to perform wet cleaning of substrates at various stages of the fabrication process. Typically, integrated circuit devices are in the form of multi-level structures. At the substrate level, transistor devices having diffusion regions are formed over and into silicon substrates. In subsequent levels, interconnect metallization lines are patterned and electrically connected to the transistor devices to define the desired functional device. As is well known, patterned conductive layers are insulated from other conductive layers by dielectric materials, such as silicon dioxide. At each metallization level there is a need to planarize metal or associated dielectric material. Without planarization, fabrication of additional metallization layers becomes substantially more difficult due to the higher variations in the surface topography. In some applications, metallization line patterns are formed in the dielectric material, and then metal CMP operations are performed to remove excess metallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Following each CMP operation, a wet clean of the substrate is performed. The wet clean is designed to wash away any by-products of the fabrication process, remove contaminants, and to achieve and maintain the necessary degree of cleanliness essential to proceed to a subsequent fabrication operation. As transistor device structures become smaller and more complex, the precision required to achieve and maintain structure definition demands exacting standards of cleanliness be maintained in all process operations. If a wet clean is incomplete or ineffective, or if a post-wet clean drying is incomplete or ineffective, then unacceptable residue or contaminants are introduced into the processing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the fabrication of hard disk drives, planarization and cleaning operations are needed to maintain a clean and smooth disk substrate. Residue or contaminants remaining on substrates in the fabrication of hard disks and other devices utilizing similar substrates is likewise unacceptable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Rinsing and drying techniques, methods, and apparatus are plentiful and known in the art, and incorporate such operations as rinsing and scrubbing, immersion, and the application of thermal, mechanical, chemical, electrical, or sonic energy and the like to remove or displace water and dry the substrate. While some scrub and rinse operations may employ acids or bases for vigorous interaction with fabrication by-products, deionized water (DIW) is commonly used to perform a final rinse before the desired drying technique is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One common drying technique is known as spin, rinse and dry (SRD). SRD uses mechanical, centrifugal, energy to rid the substrate of water by spinning the substrate until dry. An SRD apparatus typically includes a substrate mounting plate within a bowl and mounted on a shaft that is configured to rotate and thus spin the substrate. The substrate is typically attached to the substrate mounting plate or spin chuck with mounting pins configured to maintain the substrate in a horizontal orientation. Rapid rotation of the spin chuck therefore spins the substrate and forces the water from the surface of the substrate. DIW is typically dispensed from a nozzle which is positioned over the substrate and connected to a DIW supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The SRD process essentially includes applying DIW and spinning the substrate dry. The drying can be enhanced with the introduction of an inert gas such as Nitrogen or an inert gas vapor to displace any water that is not completely removed by spinning. Additional variations include heating the DIW, heating the SRD environment, heating the inert gas, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another common drying technique is known as a Marangoni technique. Marangoni drying typically includes using a chemical drying fluid or solvent such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to introduce favorable surface tension gradients facilitating removal of water from the surface of a substrate. Variations of the Marangoni technique also include the introduction of an inert gas such as Nitrogen as a carrier gas for IPA vapor delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Prior art drying also includes the combination of the Marangoni technique with an SRD apparatus. This method has included the introduction of IPA or IPA vapor to a surface of a substrate which is mounted on a spin chuck. As the spin chuck rotates the substrate, centrifugal force drives water from the surface of the substrate, and Marangoni drying maximizes removal of water from the surface of the substrate while minimizing residue or contaminants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A limitation of the combination of SRD and Marangoni techniques is that the typical prior art SRD provides for single-sided rinsing and drying of a wafer or substrate. A substrate mounted on a spin chuck has only one surface exposed for rinsing and drying. In order to achieve and maintain the level of cleanliness desired for current fabrication environments, simultaneous dual-sided rinsing and drying is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, there is a need for substrate preparation systems and methods that maximize the cleaning and drying of wafers and other substrates in order to meet and exceed the ever more stringent cleanliness requirements for fabrication processes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Broadly speaking, the present invention fills these needs by providing a substrate preparation system that implements a surface tension reducing process to effectively and efficiently provide cleaning, drying, etching, or other desired processing of a substrate, and that performs the processing on both top or active and backside surfaces of a substrate simultaneously. The present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a device, or a method. Several embodiments of the present invention are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a system for rinsing and drying a substrate is disclosed. The system includes a chuck having fingers for edge gripping the substrate. The chuck is configured to rotate the substrate. The system further includes an upper dispense arm positioned over an active surface of the substrate, and a lower dispense arm positioned below a backside surface of the substrate. The upper dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a periphery of the active surface of the substrate, and the lower dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a periphery of the backside surface of the substrate. Each dispense arm further includes a pair of supply lines for delivering fluids over each of the active surface and the backside surface of the substrate. The system also includes a connection coupling the upper dispense arm with the lower dispense arm so that as the upper dispense arm and the lower dispense arm move between the center region and the periphery of the substrate, the upper dispense arm and the lower dispense arm remain aligned on opposite surfaces of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a system for rinsing and drying a substrate is disclosed. The system includes a chuck configured to rotate the substrate and having fingers for edge gripping the substrate. The system further includes a first dispense arm positioned adjacent to an active surface of the substrate, and a second dispense arm positioned adjacent to a backside surface of the substrate. The first dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a peripheral edge of the active surface of the substrate, and includes a pair of supply lines for delivering fluids over the active surface of the substrate The second dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a peripheral edge of the backside surface of the substrate, and includes a pair of supply lines for delivering fluids over the backside surface of the substrate. The system also includes a spray shield surrounding the substrate in the chuck. The spray shield is configured with a sliding door. When the sliding door is in an open position access is provided to insert and remove the substrate from the fingers of the chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In still a further embodiment, a system for preparing a substrate is disclosed. The system includes a chuck which has fingers for edge gripping the substrate, and which is configured to rotate the substrate. In the system, a first dispense arm is positioned beside an active surface of the substrate. The first dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a peripheral edge of the active surface of the substrate. The first dispense arm further includes a first pair of supply lines for delivering fluids over the active surface of the substrate. The first pair of supply lines are angled in a direction toward the peripheral edge. The system further includes a second dispense arm positioned beside a backside surface of the substrate. The second dispense arm is capable of moving between a center region and a peripheral edge of the backside surface of the substrate. The second dispense arm further includes a second pair of supply lines for delivering fluids over the backside surface of the substrate. The second pair of supply lines are angled in a direction toward the peripheral edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention are numerous. One notable benefit and advantage of the invention is the simultaneous preparation of both top or active and backside surfaces of a substrate. The hollow design of the spindle and chuck provides access to both the active and the backside surfaces of a substrate for cleaning, drying, or otherwise processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another benefit is the ease with which the present invention is configured for a plurality of substrate sizes. The procedure to swap out one size of substrate chuck for another is fast and efficient providing for multiple applications and minimum down time for integrated process systems. Additionally, the design provides for ease of belt changing or tensioning by adjustment of the spindle motor position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit is the ability to integrate the system into existing process equipment resulting in increased quality and quantity of product with fewer defects or scrap due to contamination. The low profile of the spray shield and spray shield door is desirable for many systems, and the pneumatic door is simply formed and does not generate particles within the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Other advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, positioning of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> across the active surface and across the backside surface of a substrate is controlled by a dispense arm controller (not shown) and a dispense arm drive shaft (not shown) contained within a dispense arm drive shaft housing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Electrical connector <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> located on the exterior of the dispense arm drive shaft housing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> provides for electrical power connection to the dispense arm controller disposed within. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the dispense arm drive shaft is mechanically connected to the upper dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> providing a direct mechanical connection between the drive shaft and the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to position the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is configured to pivot about the upper dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to move the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and position the upper dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>across an active (top) surface of a substrate. In one embodiment of the invention, the rinsing and drying process dispenses the cleaning agent and the drying agent along a radius of a spinning substrate from a center region of the substrate to a peripheral region of the substrate. The upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is therefore moved along the surface of the spinning substrate from the center region outward to a peripheral region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is configured to substantially mirror the movement of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves along the surface of the spinning substrate from the center region outward to a peripheral region, the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is positioned substantially opposing the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the opposite or backside surface of the substrate, moving from the center region to the outer region of the substrate with the upper dispense aim <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not mechanically connected, however, to the dispense arm drive shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is magnetically connected to the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through upper dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The magnetic connection provides for positive mechanical control of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is mirrored by the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the magnetic coupling is with a magnet which provides control of the degree of movement of the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be halted near a periphery of a substrate as it approaches an interior wall of the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can continue travel to the periphery of the substrate while lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> remains stationary near a periphery region of the backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As can be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 6</cross-reference> described below, movement of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can continue to fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> while lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is limited to movement within the confines of the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a substrate is mounted on a hollow chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> attached to a hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which is rotated. Upper dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are directed at a top or active surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and lower dispense nozzles are directed at a bottom or backside surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, upper dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and lower dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are each angled in a direction toward the periphery region of substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are moved from a center of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> attached to and rotating with the chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, to a periphery region of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in direction <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a cleaning agent is applied through the nozzle from the cleaning agent supply <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on upper dispense arm head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and through the nozzle from the cleaning agent supply <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on lower dispense arm head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the active and to the backside surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As will be described in greater detail below, in one embodiment, the cleaning agent is followed immediately by the drying agent which is applied through the nozzle from drying agent supply <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on upper dispense arm head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and through the nozzle from drying agent supply <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on lower dispense arm head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, as the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are moved across the surface of a substrate in direction <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a cleaning agent and a drying agent are applied to both top and bottom surfaces of a rotating substrate attached to the chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> encircles the chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is configured to confine any liquid used in the cleaning, drying, or other process to a space within the cavity containing the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and attached chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As cleaning, drying, or other agents are applied to a substrate during processing, any droplets that may be thrown from the spinning substrate are blocked by the spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and confined within the interior cavity having the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and attached chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be constructed of PET, plastic, polyurethane, or any suitable light weight material to provide strength and form, is easily cleaned, and suitable for clean room applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is configured to provide access to the interior region or cavity having the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and attached chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is configured as a section of spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that slides open to provide access to the interior region or cavity, and slides closed to create a substantially solid spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> encircling the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. When the spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is in the open position, a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can be inserted onto or removed from chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The access provided by opening the sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> allows a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to be inserted by a robot (not shown) at a proper position and orientation to be received in fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Once the substrate is inserted and attached to fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be closed to maintain circular containment of any fluids within the cavity of the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is inserted into fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and wafer sensor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>senses and assures proper orientation and positioning. Once proper orientation and positioning is assured, moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) locks substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in position. The robot (not shown) is withdrawn, and sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> closes, allowing spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to rotate, thus rotating chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and mounted substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, actuation to position the sliding spray shield door <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in an open or closed position is provided by a pneumatic actuator (not shown). Pneumatic tube <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is routed along a periphery of a section of spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at a base or lower region of spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, pneumatic tube <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is configured with a magnetic ball or bearing within the tube. The pneumatic actuator moves the magnetic ball along the interior of pneumatic tube <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>.

In one embodiment, moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is provided to secure a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in place. When a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is inserted, at least two fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are configured to receive the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is positioned in fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> by a robot (not shown), moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is in an open or unlock position. When the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is properly positioned in fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> pivots into an edge of the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to lock the substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in place. A properly positioned substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, therefore, is supported at the edges by fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are configured to position a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> slightly off-center from an axis of rotation of hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The slightly off-center positioning is configured to further secure a substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> against fingers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and minimize pressure against moveable finger <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> generated during rotation of hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Similarly, the lower dispense arm head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>directs the lower dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the cleaning agent precedes the drying agent as the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> travels across the backside surface of substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> from a center region to a periphery of the rotating substrate. In one embodiment, upper dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and lower dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are oriented to be angled away from the center and toward the edge of the substrate, in the general direction of nozzle travel during substrate processing. Cleaning agents are selected from a plurality of chemicals or DIW according to the desired application. The present invention includes embodiments for cleaning, etching, and rinsing of substrates. Examples of cleaning agents include DIW, solutions of HF, NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or any of acids such as HCl, HNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, HBr, H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and the like. Examples of drying agents include IPA, diacetone, ethyllactate, ethylglycol, methylpyrrolidon, and the like. As described above, when the drying agent is dispensed following the cleaning agent, the surface tension of the cleaning agent is reduced which facilitates the removal of the liquid by moving it outward towards the edge of the spinning substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the cleaning and drying process in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. A cleaning agent is applied ahead of a drying agent to a top surface and to a backside surface of a spinning substrate while moving from a center region of a substrate towards a periphery region of a substrate. The cleaning agent is configured to clean, etch or rinse the surfaces of the substrate, and at the introduction of the drying agent in region <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the surface tension of the liquid is reduced and the movement of the liquid and residue is enhanced thereby drying the surfaces of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is magnetically coupled to the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the upper dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm support post <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and the upper dispense arm is mechanically connected to the dispense arm drive shaft contained within the dispense arm drive shaft housing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the movement of upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> across the top surface of the spinning substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> from a center region to a periphery is directed by a dispense arm controller contained within the dispense arm drive shaft housing <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The dispense arm controller directs the dispense arm drive shaft which positions the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The magnetically coupled lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> mirrors the movement of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, traveling from a center region to a periphery of spinning substrate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> across the backside. This provides for simultaneous top and backside cleaning and drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, a brake or governor is configured to the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to prevent contact between the lower dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and an interior surface of the hollow spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Substrate processing proceeds as described from a center of a rotating substrate towards a periphery of the rotating substrate. Upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> synchronously travel across the active and backside surfaces of the rotating substrate until a pre-determined point at or near the substrate edge. At the pre-determined point, the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is stopped while the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> continues travel, moving the upper dispense nozzles <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>up to or across the substrate edge as desired. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> halted at a pre-determined point, and upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> allowed to continue travel in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, another brake or governor is configured for upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> defining the limit of travel of the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> within spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> cavity. When the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are aligned as the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is returned to the center region of the processing area, magnetic coupling is restored and the upper dispense arm <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the lower dispense arm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> once again travel or are moved together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Excess liquid from the cleaning agent and the drying agent is blocked from dispersal over the substrate drying system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by spray shield <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and is substantially contained within the hollow cavity of the spindle <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and chuck <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, liquid residue is collected in drip tray <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and drained through drain <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, vaporized gases are used as drying agents and in the event of accumulated fumes or gases, exhaust <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is provided to release such fumes or gases from within the confines of the drip tray <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a substrate processing station <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, at least one substrate drying system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is integrated with at least one brush box scrubber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to create a substrate processing station for efficient processing that minimizes substrate transfer and exposure, as well as minimizing clean room floor space requirements. In this embodiment, at least one substrate drying system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is configured with at least one brush box <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> such that a substrate is first processed through one or more operations in the at least one brush box <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and then transferred to the at least one substrate drying system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for a rinsing, drying, or other process. By way of example, a substrate drying system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be mounted on top of a brush box <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to minimize transfer distance and to minimize system or tool foot print. Further, in a clean room environment the filtration system can maintain an increasing level of cleanliness with elevation. Thus, the dirtier process of scrubbing is performed at a lower level, and the increasingly cleaner operation of substrate rinsing and drying is performed at a higher level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the substrate processing station <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is integrated into a cluster of substrate processing tools, also known as a cluster tool or an integrated substrate processing cluster module, to maximize efficient use of clean room floor space, and to exploit economical and efficient implementation of substrate processing methods and systems. In just one example, one embodiment of the present invention is integrated into an integrated substrate processing cluster module including, by way of example, a wafer handling system, a load and unload module, an etch process module with a coupled etch load lock, and a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process module. An embodiment of the present invention is integrated into the cluster module as a clean process module capable of handling post-CMP clean and post-etch clean operations. </paragraph>
