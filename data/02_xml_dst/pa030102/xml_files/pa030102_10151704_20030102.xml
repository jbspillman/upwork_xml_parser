<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a printing apparatus and pre-printing information estimation method, and more particularly to a printing apparatus and pre-printing information estimation method for printing content represented by means of a markup language stipulated by XML (extensible Markup Language). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, digitalization of broadcast data has been making rapid progress in the field of broadcasting technology. Advantages of digitalizing broadcast data include the fact that digital data can use bands more efficiently than analog data, and a high degree of affinity with data other than video and audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One kind of broadcast content using digital data is content represented by means of XML. XML is a Meta-language that stipulates a markup language with a special feature of enabling tags to be defined uniquely. With BML (Broadcast markup Language), an XML application for digital broadcasting, various kinds of information can be incorporated as digital data, such as program linkage type information: for example, recipe information for a cooking program or reference information for a quiz program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In XML, including BML, style information relating to the representation style is written as a style sheet. In XML, a plurality of style sheets can be applied to one document written in XML language format (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;XML instance&rdquo;). For example, it is possible to apply a display style sheet and a print style sheet individually for one XML instance according to the output destination conditions or purpose, and make full use of the output performance of a display apparatus that displays on a cathode ray tube, liquid crystal display, etc., and a printing apparatus, according to differences in output conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When style sheets with different layouts are used for a display style sheet and print style sheet, the layouts of displayed contents and contents to be printed are different, and it is therefore difficult to confirm print contents from the displayed contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, with a conventional apparatus there is a problem in that, when layout information differs for a display style sheet and print style sheet, the print layout cannot be confirmed (on a display apparatus or the like) until printed from a printing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, with a conventional apparatus there is a problem in that the time necessary for printing cannot be known. Furthermore, with a conventional apparatus there is a problem in that the cost necessary for printing cannot be known. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a printing apparatus and pre-printing information estimation method that make it possible to provide print image information and print job results information prior to printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by seeking information that determines print execution results before executing printing when performing printing with a printing apparatus from a receiving apparatus (client apparatus), and transmitting that information to, and displaying that information on, the receiving apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A client apparatus here includes an apparatus that receives broadcast content transmitted from a broadcasting station, as well as a client apparatus that transmits a data request to a server and receives data in a general server-client system.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With reference now to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Print Preview Image Creation&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The gist of the present invention is to convert print image data taking account of print results and differences in output to a display apparatus based on the display capability of a receiving apparatus (client apparatus), create preview image data (hereinafter referred to simply as &ldquo;preview data&rdquo;), transmit this preview data to a receiving apparatus, and display this preview data in the receiving apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a receiving apparatus and printing apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives a digital broadcast or similar signal and displays broadcast contents. When broadcast contents are to be printed, the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> revieves a print directive and outputs data necessary for printing to a printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates print contents preview image data and outputs this data to the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When a print preview is ordered by the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, print image data is displayed, and print contents confirmation and a print directive are prompted. Then the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> outputs the input print directive to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> prints print contents corresponding to the preview image in accordance with the directive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The communication procedure between the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sequence diagram showing an example of signal exchange between the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the communication procedure is described for a case where, when the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> prints received contents, the print results are displayed beforehand in the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and printing is performed after the print contents have been confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> outputs content to be printed-for example, XML content-from received broadcast contents to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Here, XML content includes an XML instance and style sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Then the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> outputs print job information indicating conditions necessary for printing, such as the printing paper size, resolution, and printing direction, for example, to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> then outputs preview information comprising conditions for displaying preview data to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Here, preview data is an image when print output is displayed on a screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates preview data from the XML content, print job information, and preview information, and outputs this preview data to the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> displays the preview data, and prompts input as to whether or not printing is to be performed. When a directive to perform printing is inputted, the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> outputs a print directive to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> prints XML content in accordance with the directive. When XML content and print job information are not stored in the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may again output XML content and print job information to the printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> together with a print directive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and printing apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will now be described in detail.

This print image data <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is image data comprising 7015 pixels vertically and 4960 pixels horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When, for example, preview data is to be displayed with the entire display area of a receiver capable of display at a resolution of 1080 vertical pixels and 1920 horizontal pixels as a preview area <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the number of pixels in a vertical side of the print image data <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is greater than the number of pixels in a vertical side of the preview area <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Also, the number of pixels in a horizontal side of the print image data <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is greater than the number of pixels in a horizontal side of the preview area <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. That is to say, if the whole of the print image data <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is displayed directly in the display area of the receiving apparatus&mdash;that is, the preview area <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&mdash;it will only be possible to display part of the page. In order to display the entire print image data <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> page in the entire display area of the receiving apparatus&mdash;that is, the preview area <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&mdash;it is necessary to change the size of the print image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Resolution conversion calculation is described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing resolution conversion ratio calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>7002</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resolution conversion ratio is calculated. The horizontal resolution ratio is a value obtained by dividing the number of horizontal pixels of the preview area by the number of horizontal pixels of the print image. The horizontal resolution of a print image for which a page can be accommodated horizontally in the preview area without protruding is determined from the product of this value and the horizontal resolution of the print image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>7003</bold></highlight>, the vertical resolution conversion ratio is calculated. The vertical resolution ratio is a value obtained by dividing the number of vertical pixels of the preview area by the number of vertical pixels of the print image. The vertical resolution of a print image for which a page can be accommodated vertically in the preview area without protruding is determined from the product of this value and the vertical resolution of the print image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>7004</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resolution conversion ratio and vertical resolution ratio are compared. By using the resolution conversion ratio with the smaller value as the overall resolution conversion ratio, it is possible to perform resolution conversion that avoids protrusion in either the horizontal or vertical direction. If the vertical resolution ratio is smaller in S<highlight><bold>7004</bold></highlight>, processing proceeds to S<highlight><bold>7005</bold></highlight>; otherwise, processing proceeds to S<highlight><bold>7006</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>7005</bold></highlight>, the horizontal resolution ratio is made the overall resolution conversion ratio. In S<highlight><bold>7006</bold></highlight>, the vertical resolution conversion ratio is made the overall resolution conversion ratio. </paragraph>

In this case, the vertical resolution conversion ratio is 0.39 and the horizontal resolution conversion ratio is 0.15. Thus, the overall resolution conversion ratio is 0.15. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> When resolution conversion of print image data is performed on this basis, the display in the preview area is as shown in the right-hand drawing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The entire page is displayed, fitting exactly in the horizontal direction while leaving a margin in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Thus, a printing apparatus of this embodiment converts print image data to preview data with an image size obtained from an above-described conversion ratio so that all the image data for printing fits into the preview area of the receiving apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> There are also cases where the preview area of the receiving apparatus uses only part of the display area. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a drawing showing an example of receiving apparatus display. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> receiving apparatus display section <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> displays an image transmitted by broadcasting or the like, a print data preview image, or information relating to operation of the receiving apparatus.

In this case, the vertical number of pixels of the preview area <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is the number obtained by subtracting the vertical number of pixels of directive area <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> from the vertical number of pixels of the display section <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. The preview area <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and directive area <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are displayed consecutively in the horizontal direction. In this case, the horizontal number of pixels of the preview area <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is the number obtained by subtracting the horizontal number of pixels of directive area <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> from the horizontal number of pixels of the display section <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, by making the size which is obtained by subtracting the number of pixels of directive area from the number of pixels of display section used as a preview area beforehand, it is possible to display preview image data, receiving apparatus information, and so forth, simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the number of pixels of preview data may be made smaller than the number of pixels of the receiving apparatus display area. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a drawing showing an example of receiving apparatus display. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> display section <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> is composed of a preview area <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and a directive area <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> that displays printing-related directives and so forth.

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In the printing apparatus, the result of subtracting the horizontal number of pixels of the left margin <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and right margin <highlight><bold>1107</bold></highlight> from the horizontal number of pixels of the display section <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> is taken as the horizontal number of pixels of a preview image, and the result of subtracting the vertical number of pixels of the top margin <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, bottom margin <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>, and directive area <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> from the vertical number of pixels of the display section <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> is taken as the vertical number of pixels of a preview image, to give the size of the preview area <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. The printing apparatus then creates preview data by converting print image data to a size that fits into the preview area <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to a printing apparatus of this embodiment, it is possible to confirm print contents with a display apparatus prior to printing from a printing apparatus by converting print image data based on the display capability of the display apparatus, and creating preview data. </paragraph>

There is coordinate information and size information for each document object, with a normal document often being composed of a plurality of document objects, and preview layout information also often being composed of coordinate information for a plurality of objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> A preview display space is a dimensionless coordinate system corresponding on a one-to-one basis to a preview area shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The difference between a preview display area and a preview display space is that a preview display area is a physical coordinate system that has units called pixels, whereas a preview display space is a dimensionless coordinate system that has no units. A preview display space is a coordinate system with the top-left corner as the origin, a horizontal X-axis, and a vertical Y-axis. Position and occupied area in the preview display area of a document object can be specified uniquely by X-coordinate value, Y-coordinate value, width, and length, in the document object preview display space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In position and size determination for a document object, it is possible to indicate a relative positional relationship in a preview display space, and in a preview display space the domain and variable type of an X-coordinate value and Y-coordinate value are arbitrary. </paragraph>

In addition, the preview pixel number calculation section <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> calculates the resolution conversion ratio for converting from the print image data size to the preview image data size, based on preview screen information output from the receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, multiplies this resolution conversion ratio by the print image data size, and outputs the result of the multiplication to the preview image generation section <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> as the number of preview data pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The operation of a printing apparatus of this embodiment will now be described using a flowchart. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing an example of the operation of a printing apparatus of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, an interface section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> receives print data. In S<highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight>, the preview pixel number calculation section <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> calculates a resolution conversion ratio that indicates the size ratio for converting print image data to preview data based on the number of display pixels of the preview area and print image data size information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight>, the preview pixel number calculation section <highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> calculates the number of preview data pixels based on the resolution conversion ratio calculated in S<highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight> and print image data size information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>2040</bold></highlight>, the layout calculation section <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> creates print image layout information based on font expansion information generated by the font expansion section <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> based on the number of print pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>2050</bold></highlight>, the preview image generation section <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> creates a preview image using print image layout information created in S<highlight><bold>2040</bold></highlight>, the number of preview data pixels calculated in S<highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight>, and font expansion information from the font expansion section <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>. This image processing is rasterization processing that creates raster data constituting a collection of small points from text or image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In S<highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight>, the interface section <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> transmits preview data to an external receiving apparatus, and processing returns to S<highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to a printing apparatus of this embodiment, it is possible to confirm print contents with a display apparatus prior to printing from a printing apparatus by calculating the print image layout based on the number of print image pixels, and creating preview data by performing rasterization processing on print data based on that number of preview data pixels and that print image layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> That is to say, according to a printing apparatus of this embodiment, it is possible to create preview data without the need for work memory for expanding print image data in a printing apparatus and without imposing a load of expanding print image data on the printing apparatus, by directly creating preview data based on the number of preview data pixels without creating print image data whose data size increases, when generating preview data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Also, according to a printing apparatus of this embodiment, it is possible to display a preview image closely resembling a print image by creating preview data layout information from print image layout information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In Embodiments 1 through 9, a case is described where XML content is composed of text only, but image data may also be included in XML content. In this case, since normal image data is compressed, means for decompressing and restoring this data must be provided separately on the printing apparatus side. Furthermore, it goes without saying that the layout processing section performs image data layout calculation processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Also, in Embodiments 1 through 9, a print style sheet is included in XML content sent from the receiving apparatus to the printing apparatus, but a print style sheet need not be included. A print style sheet stored in a print style sheet storage section of the printing apparatus at the time of shipment, for example, may be used as a print style sheet in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Further, in Embodiments 1 to 9 a document object output to the layout combining section is a structured document forming a tree structure, but other structures may be used in addition to the tree structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the above embodiments the descriptions have referred to the use of a resolution conversion ratio, but the resolution conversion ratio may also be made a pixel number conversion ratio. Here, a resolution conversion ratio is a conversion ratio obtained from the ratio of print image resolution to preview image resolution, and a pixel number conversion ratio is a conversion ratio obtained from the ratio of the number of print image pixels to the number of preview image pixels. </paragraph>
