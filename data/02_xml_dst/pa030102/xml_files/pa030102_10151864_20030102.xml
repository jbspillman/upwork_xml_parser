<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the priority of German Patent Application No. 101 31 284.9 filed Jun. 28, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an apparatus for converting measurement signals into digital signals that are suitable for processing in a microprocessor. More particularly the present invention relates to such an apparatus wherein the signals have been initiated in a piezo sensor by accelerations acting on the sensor during the impacts of a percussion device, particularly a hydraulic hammer, and are used to determine the number of work strokes that have been executed in the impact direction of the percussion device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the solution known from the document DE 199 23 680 A1, the invention is based on the realization that the current total number of impacts executed by the percussion aggregate represents a relevant variable for determining the active service life, and&mdash;through a comparison to comparable preset values&mdash;can also yield information regarding the state of utilization of the relevant percussion aggregate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The simplest method of obtaining information about the state of utilization of the percussion device is to check whether the current total number of impacts executed by the percussion device has attained an order of magnitude that corresponds to the total number of impacts that defines a maintenance-free operating period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The above cited document, which was published prior to this application, proposes to determine the service life and the state of utilization of a hydraulic percussion device by generating measurement signals during the individual, consecutive operating periods of the percussion device, from which the number of strokes that the percussion piston of the percussion device has executed in a direction of movement can be determined. The publication further proposes to continuously add the number of signals and store the total number, and make the current total number of signals recognizable, at least temporarily, in the form of an indicator of the state of utilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To generate the measurement signals that indicate the number of impacts, a measurement-value indicator can be provided in the form of a piezo sensor, which detects oscillations that have been initiated by the percussion-piston strokes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the invention to provide an apparatus for converting relevant measurement signals that have been generated by a piezo sensor into digital signals, with the apparatus reliably supplying the necessary information and having a low energy requirement, despite the difficult working conditions expected in the use of hydraulic percussion devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the novel conversion apparatus is intended to be embodied to permit a compact design, and thus easily be mounted, without any special measures, to the percussion device at a location that is suitable for generating measurement signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Finally, the conversion apparatus is intended to be distinguished by the fact that it is extensively independent of the design, structural size and other characteristic features of the percussion device to be monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above object generally is accomplished by a novel conversion apparatus wherein the underlying concept lies in re-forming measurement signals, which have been generated in consecutive stages by a piezo sensor, into digital signals that provide sufficiently reliable information about the impacts executed by the percussion device, and are in a suitable form for processing in a microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The conversion apparatus according to the invention includes: a rectifier that is connected to the output of the piezo sensor and suppresses the negative component of the measurement signal produced by the piezo sensor; a peak-value detector, that is connected to the output of the rectifier and converts the remaining, positive component of the measurement signal into an envelope curve; a high-pass filter that causes the envelope curves of consecutive measurement signals to be converted into intermediate signals whose amplitude has a regenerative zero passage; and a comparator, which is disposed downstream of the high-pass filter and is connected on the output side to the digital input of the microprocessor, that effects the conversion of the intermediate signals into digital signals having a rectangular amplitude response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The high-pass filter changes the signals that are introduced into it such that their amplitude has a perfect zero passage. Accordingly, the conversion apparatus is automatically adapted to the associated percussion device. Consequently, the conversion apparatus can be used in connection with differently-configured percussion devices without necessitating an equipment conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Within the scope of the invention, a piezoelectric shock sensor, such as is found in a laptop for protecting the hard disk, can be used as a piezo sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a feature of the invention, the comparator additionally has a capacitor that is designed such that only digital signals located at a predetermined minimum interval from the digital signal of the preceding impact are present at the comparator output. The additional capacitor therefore assures the suppression of &ldquo;error signals&rdquo; also generated by the piezo sensor, which may be initiated, for example, by accelerations of the percussion aggregate that are not typically anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention is preferably embodied such that the piezo sensor simultaneously forms the energy source for the components disposed upstream of the comparator&mdash;namely, the rectifier, the peak-value detector and the high-pass filter&mdash;and the comparator is connected to an energy supply that is independent of the piezo sensor. The advantage of this feature is that the conversion apparatus, with the exception of the comparator, requires no external energy supply, and only exhibits a low energy consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is possible to equip the conversion apparatus and the downstream microprocessor with an integrated battery unit that may permit a service life of more than five years. The battery unit can particularly comprise one or more lithium-thionyl-chloride batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a measure for improving the handling and the economical aspect of the conversion apparatus, the piezo sensor, the rectifier, the peak-value detector, the high-pass filter and the comparator can be combined with the microprocessor to form a combined mechanical component, which is secured as a unit to the housing of the percussion device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The listed components, as well as the aforementioned battery unit and the capacitor that may additionally be associated with the comparator, are preferably secured inside a metallic sleeve by an elastic filling compound, while the sleeve is secured to the housing of the percussion device by an elastic damping layer. The oscillating behavior of the filling compound and the damping layer stipulates that they be designed such that the accelerations originating from the percussion device initiate the necessary signals in the piezo sensor with sufficient reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a normal scenario, it suffices for the piezo sensor, the rectifier, the peak-value detector, the high-pass filter and the comparator to be designed, and matched to one another, such that the components are capable of functioning at percussion-device impact frequencies between 3 and 70 Hz. This embodiment renders the conversion apparatus extensively independent of the design, structural size and other characteristic features of the percussion device, without significant adaptive measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention is described in detail below in conjunction with the drawing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The representation according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a hydraulic percussion device, which is known per se, in the form of a hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hammer, a percussion piston <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is guided to move back and forth in the longitudinal direction, and, due to the effect of a control unit, not shown, acts on a tool as a chisel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with the movement energy originating from the percussion piston <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being converted into impact energy. An arrow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates the movement of the percussion piston <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the direction of the work stroke (impact direction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is secured to a support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is formed as a support housing or support frame and has a connector console <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The console allows the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to be connected to a support device, particularly the boom of a hydraulic excavator. As ensues from the publication DE 199 23 680, the support device also supplies the hydraulic energy needed for operating the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The accelerations occurring in the operating state of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, during the impacts of the percussion piston <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>, also act on a piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby initiating measurement signals in the sensor that can be used to determine the number of work strokes executed in the impact direction (arrow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, whose primary components include a rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> On the output side, the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the digital input <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which the digital signals generated by the effect of the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are stored and processed. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> particularly serves in storing and adding the received digital signals, and using them to derive and supply data relating to the active service life of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as well as data relating to the state of utilization of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as they relate to predetermined maintenance intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The information supplied by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be read out in a wireless manner by way of an infrared interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example, via a laptop or a mobile telephone. The infrared interface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also facilitates the transfer of data, programs and commands to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A battery unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having at least one lithium-thionyl-chloride battery is provided for supplying energy to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. To extend the service life of the battery <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is configured such that the piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> simultaneously constitutes the energy source for the rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These components of the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are therefore not connected to an external energy supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by a dot-dash rectangular surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are combined to form a mechanical component that is secured as a unit to the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The component defined by the rectangular outline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is represented by 14&prime; on the housing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>. In a variation within the spirit of the invention, the aforementioned component can also be mounted on the support element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the connector console <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the support device, for example, the boom of the hydraulic excavator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The schematic circuit diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> indicates the electrical connection of the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as well as the fundamental layout of the components <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the output of the piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having two diodes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>with the diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being connected in parallel with the sensor and the diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being connected in series with the sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The diode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also represents a component of the peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is linked in turn to the peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which has a high-impedance resistor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected in parallel with the sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which is connected in parallel with the resistor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Adjoining the component <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a series capacitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a parallel connected high-impedance resistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Disposed downstream of the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which includes a difference amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and two high-impedance input resistors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and is supplied with energy by the battery unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The resistors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>form a voltage divider that is connected across the energy supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and generates a reference voltage, at its center tap that is connected to the negative input of the difference amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>As a result, the conversion apparatus is insensitive to external interfering voltages. The output of the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the positive input of the amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>which compares the signals at its two inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is additionally provided with a capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>connected between its output <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the positive input of the amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>The capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serves to suppress signals that fail to follow at a minimum interval from the signal of the preceding impact. As already mentioned, the output <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is linked to the digital input <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are otherwise designed and matched to one another such that the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed by the components <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be used for impact frequencies between 3 and 70 Hz of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>explain the function of the piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the components <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Here, the amplitude response of the respective signals is shown over time (in milliseconds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the piezo sensor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the accelerations occurring due to the impacts of the hydraulic hammer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and acting on the piezo sensor initiate the generation of the measurement signals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the result of the influence of the rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on these signals is the suppression, i.e., clipping, of the negative component of the measurement signal supplied to the rectifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The peak-value detector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> causes the remaining, positive component of the measurement signal to be converted into an envelope curve as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The effect of the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> displaces this envelope curve, as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>such that the amplitude response exhibits consecutive intermediate signals having &ldquo;clean&rdquo; zero passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> compares the signal at the output of the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the reference voltage produced by the voltage divider <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and converts the intermediate signals prepared in the above described manner into digital signals having a rectangular amplitude response, so that the downstream connective microprocessor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can receive and process them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiment and the wiring of the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> permit the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be used in hydraulic percussion devices of varying designs without requiring an equipment conversion. Moreover, with a suitable layout and design of the components <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the conversion apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, with the exception of the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, requires no additional energy source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The invention therefore improves upon the preparation of information described in DE 199 23 680, with respect to simplification or increased economical qualities, with the information being used to derive an assessment of the active service life of a hydraulic percussion aggregate and its state of utilization, for example, with respect to anticipated maintenance intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as set forth herein. </paragraph>
