<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rotational speed detector for detecting a rotational speed such as a wheel speed of an automobile and to a method of manufacturing the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of a conventional wheel speed detector which is installed on a vehicle to face a rotor rotating together with a vehicle wheel is disclosed in JP-A-11-14644. In this detector, a sensor element is disposed in a depressed portion of a sensor housing, and the sensor element and associated circuits are covered with a resin material to protect them against water. The sensor element covered with the resin is positioned to face the rotor. A sufficient air gap between the detector and the rotor is required to absorb a dimensional dispersion of those components and vibration of a driving axle due to driving on a rough road or rolling of a vehicle body. On the other hand, it is required to make a distance between the sensor element and the rotor sufficiently small to obtain sensor signals at a high level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because a resin layer covering the sensor element is interposed between the rotor and the sensor element in the conventional detector described above, it is necessary to make the resin layer thin to satisfy both requirements. However, it is difficult to make the resin layer thin because a certain thickness of the resin layer is necessary to provide a good sealing against water when the detector is used under severe environmental conditions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide an improved rotational speed detector which is able to generate accurate signals while providing a sufficiently large air gap between the detector and a rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The rotational speed detector is composed of an elongate housing in which a detector unit is contained, a resin center rod having a terminal wire connected to a lead wire led out from the detector unit, and a resin mold covering the outside of the center rod and filling a part of an inside space of the housing. The detector unit includes a sensor element and an integrated circuit chip for processing signals from the sensor element. The elongate housing has a front wall facing a magnetized rotor rotated by a rotating object such as a driving wheel of an automotive vehicle. The rotational speed of the rotating object is detected by the sensor element in the detector unit. An air gap between the front wall of the detector and the rotor has to be made sufficiently large to absorb any vibration of the rotor relative to the front wall of the detector, while securing a high sensitivity of the detector. For this purpose, the detector unit has to be tightly held in the housing to avoid any air-gap loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a manufacturing process of the rotational speed detector, the lead wire led out from the detector unit is electrically connected to the terminal wire molded in the resin center rod. Then, the detector unit is inserted into the housing, and the housing is mechanically connected to the center rod. The center rod and the housing thus connected are put in a molding die, and a resin material is supplied to the molding die. The resin material fills a part of the inner space of the housing to fixedly hold the detector unit in the housing and covers the outside of the center rod and a part of the outer periphery of the housing, thereby forming an integral resin mold that firmly connects components of the rotational speed detector into a single body. The resin mold does not cover the front surface of the housing that faces the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The detector unit is made in a form of a thin plate and firmly held in the elongate housing to avoid any gap loss. Accordingly, the air gap between the front wall of the housing and the rotor can be made sufficiently large while securing a high sensitivity of the detector. The detector unit is held in the housing by engaging a step made on the detector unit with a step made on the housing. Therefore, the detector unit is correctly positioned in the housing, making the front surface of the detector unit contact the front wall of the housing. The housing and the center rod are connected to each other by inserting a projection made on the housing into a depression made on the center rod to firmly connect both parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The resin mold covering the outside of the center rod and part of the housing is made relatively thin to avoid formation of voids or cavities in the resin mold. The detector unit contained in the housing is protected against water by the resin filling an open space of the housing. A projected portion is formed around a flange of the housing that is covered by the resin mold, and the projected portion is melt by heat of the resin in the molding process. In this manner, the housing and the resin mold can be water-tightly connected to each other. Further, a part of the resin mold fills a ditch formed on the inside surface of the rear wall to tightly hold the detector unit in the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a sufficient air gap is provided between the detector and the rotor, while securing a high sensitivity of the detector. The detector can be efficiently manufactured at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other objects and features of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a better understanding of the preferred embodiment described below with reference to the following drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to accompanying drawings. First, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> portion of a driving axle where a wheel speed sensor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is mounted will be described. A bearing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed on a driving axle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of an automobile. The bearing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is composed of an inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>fixed to the axle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>fixed to a vehicle body (not shown) and balls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>disposed between the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A pair of oil seals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are disposed at both ends of the bearing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that lubricant filling a space between the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is prevented from flowing out. A ring-shaped rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attached to one of the oil seals <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> rotates together with the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, representing a rotational speed of the vehicle wheel. The ring-shaped rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is magnetized to form alternately N and S poles thereon and disposed coaxially with the driving axle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to circumference the driving axle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed in the outer ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the wheel speed detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is forcibly inserted into the hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and fixed thereto. An elongate housing of the detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from the hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>so that a detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contained in the housing faces the rotor S. An upper portion of the detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and an O-ring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed in an outer groove formed at a middle portion of the detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to prevent water from entering through the hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, a structure of the wheel speed detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described. The detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is composed of an elongate housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in which a detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted, a center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed around the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an upper portion of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a molded unit, in which a sensor element such as an MRE (magnetoresistive element) for generating output signals responsive to changes in magnetic field, an integrated circuit chip for processing the output signals from the sensor element, a lead wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and other components are molded together with a resin material. The detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into an inner space of the elongate housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a direction X shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed in a substantially rectangular pillar shape having an elongate inner space. One end of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is closed and the other end is opened. The detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the open end. A front sidewall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that faces the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> constitutes a detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a rear sidewall opposite to the front sidewall forms a rear surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed on the rear sidewall at a position close to the closed end of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a rectangular cross-sectional area which substantially fits the size of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Ditches <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</cross-reference>) are formed on the rear wall along a direction X. A part of the resin material forming the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> flows into the ditches <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and fills the ditches <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in a manner explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A circular flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is formed around the outer periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at a position close to the open end of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A portion of the outer periphery of the circular flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is further projected outwardly, forming a circularly projected portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Further, a projection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>projected upwardly from the open end of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed, so that the projection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>engages with a depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the bottom end of the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fixedly connected to each other by inserting the projection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>into the depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of resin, and a terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is held in the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by molding together. The terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is bent at right angle at a middle portion thereof, and one end of the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends from the bottom end of the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while the other end extends from a side of the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. One end of the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> downwardly extending from the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to an upwardly extending end of a lead wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>led out from the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The other end of the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extending from the side of the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves as a terminal to be connected to an outside device such as an electronic unit for controlling an anti-block braking system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> therein and the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> containing the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therein are connected into a unitary body by resin molding. The molded resin forms the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that covers the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the circular flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The molding resin also flows into an upper part of the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed on the inner surface of the rear wall. An outer groove <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to which the O-ring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inserted is also formed on the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the rear surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are not covered by the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A process of manufacturing the wheel speed detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D. First, the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the lead wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>molded together with other components and the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> molded with resin together with the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are prepared. Then, the lead wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the terminal wire <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by welding or other methods such as heat-staking, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted into the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is separately prepared, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by inserting the projection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> up to the bottom thereof. The step formed at the end portion of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> abuts the step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is correctly assembled to the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the front surface of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contacts the front wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without fail. Since the thickness of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made substantially equal to the distance between the front wall and the rear wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the detector unit is correctly positioned in the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Then, the unitary body of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed in a molding die (not shown), and a resin material is supplied into the molding die to form the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which firmly connects the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together. In the molding process, the resin material flows in directions shown by arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the resin flows along the outer periphery of the circular flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. The projected portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>formed on the outer periphery of the flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is melted by heat of the resin, and thereby the flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is firmly connected to the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this manner, water entering into the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a contacting surface between the flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is surely prevented. In the molding process, the resin also enters into the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereby to fill the space above the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the resin flows into the ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed on the rear wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereby to firmly fix the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the inner space of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It may be possible to form the center rod portion at the same molding process of forming the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without using a separately formed center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, it is preferable to use the separately formed center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> because the thickness of the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made thin, and thereby formation of voids or small cavities which may be formed in a thicker resin mold can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The wheel speed detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> described above has the following advantages. Since the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the sensor element is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that includes the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is tightly held therein, a total thickness of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be made thin. Accordingly, an air gap between the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be made sufficiently wide without sacrificing the sensing ability of the detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the ditch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>filled with the resin forming the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the inside surface of the rear wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is tightly contacts the front wall forming the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, any gap loss between the sensor element and the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Since the step formed on the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> abuts the step formed on the rear wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be correctly positioned in the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the front side of the detector unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contacts the front wall of the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without fail. Since the center rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by inserting the projection <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>into the depression <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, both can be firmly and correctly connected. Since the projected portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is formed on the outer periphery of the circular flange <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be water-tightly connected to the resin mold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, but it may be variously modified. For example, the magnetized rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a flat-ring shape may be replaced with a rotor having teeth. Though the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>faces the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in an axial direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment, the detecting surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be positioned to face the rotor in a radial direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The present invention may be applied to other rotational speed detectors than the wheel speed detector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
