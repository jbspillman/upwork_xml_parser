<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fluoroelastomeric compositions consisting essentially of a fluoroelastomer and of a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer, having improved chemical and thermal resistance, high hardness and lower fluid permeability, in particular hydrocarbons, combined with good mechanical properties and elongation higher than 200%, said compositions usable in the preparation of sealing manufactured articles, for example gaskets or pipes, in particular for the oil industry, said manufactured articles having surfaces roughnesses free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the present invention relates to fluoroelastomeric compositions comprising a fluoroelastomeric matrix which incorporates semi-crystalline fluoropolymer particles, said compositions characterized by improved mechanical properties combined with high hardness and improved surface aspect, roughness free. Said combination of properties makes available fluoroelastomers usable in the oil drilling field, wherein the fluoroelastomer manufactured articles must resist to high pressure variations and have good sealing properties. As manufactured articles, pipes, fittings, shaft seals (oil seal rings), gaskets can be mentioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known that to increase the fluoroelastomer hardness in the oil drilling field, high amounts of filler, such as carbon black, in an amount of the order of 40-60 phr, are to be added. In this way higher hardnesses are obtained, but the mechanical properties, in particular the elongation at break decreases to values of 100%, whereby the so obtained manufactured article loses its elastomeric properties and therefore it is more easily lacerable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By trying to replace the carbon black filler with a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer, for example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powder, there are many difficulties in its incorporation already at amounts of about 25% by weight of semi-crystalline fluoropolymer. At any rate it is not possible to prepare an homogeneous blend between the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer. Furthermore the manufactured articles have no suitable hardnesses for applications in oil industry. Generally, to obtain a satisfactory homogeneization of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer in the fluoroelastomer, it is necessary to use complicated technologies, using open mixers with complicated incorporation cycles, for example by heating rolls and using several steps. Even operating with these extremely complicated technologies, the incorporation of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer in the fluoroelastomer is not uniform and the manufactured article shows poor mechanical properties (in particular the modulus/elongation ratio) and poor reproduci-bility of the results, whereby the preparation process has poor reliability and there is a high number of pieces to be discarded. Besides, the final manufactured article is not homogeneous due to the poor disperdibility of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer and therefore the hardness, even though it has an average value suitable to said applications, changes from point to point whereby the properties of the finished manufactured article are poor as above indicated and are not suitable for the use in the oil field, in particular in the oil drilling. Besides the sealing properties are poor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is known to incorporate under the latex form a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer in a fluoroelastomer to improve the mechanical properties with respect to a fluoroelastomer filled with PTFE powder. The particles of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer latex have sizes comprised between 10 and 100 nm. A latex of a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer is used in an amount lower than 40% by weight. Said compositions are not suitable for the oil drilling applications, both for the hardness values and for the mechanical and sealing properties. See the European patent application 1,031,607. In said patent application the fluoroelastomer is used in high excess with respect to the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer. In the Examples amounts of the fluoropolymer between 15-20% are used. It has been shown that with said amounts, surface roughnesses free are obtained. No examples with amounts higher than 20% are given. Therefore from said description one could not predict the surface aspect and the homogeneity of the properties (in particular mechanical, hardness and sealing properties) of the manufactured article increasing the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer amount to values higher than 20%. The filler amount of 15-20% corresponds indeed to the amount of carbon black normally used in fluoroelastomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The skilled man in the art was not able therefore to expect that by increasing the amount of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymers to values higher than 20%, manufactured articles could be obtained, roughnesses free, easily able with the conventional transformation technology of fluoroelastomers (for example open mixers), and with the excellent combination and homogeneity of properties required by the oil industry, for example for the oil drilling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In fact an essential aspect to obtain said properties is that the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer when used in amounts higher than 40% is capable to disperse in the fluoroelastomer without formation of aggregates and therefore maintaining the original size of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer. The formation of said aggregates is a significant factor for the unhomogeneity and roughness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The need was felt to have available fluoroelastomeric compositions having the following combination of properties: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> improved mechanical properties, in particular improved elastic modulus/elongation at break ratio; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> elongation at break higher than 200%; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> high hardness, homogeneous on the whole manufactured article and suitable for oil drilling applications; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> improved chemical and thermal resistance; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> excellent surface aspect, roughnesses free; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> working easiness in equipments conventionally used in the fluoroelastomer field, without using complicated technologies for incorporation of fluoropolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to have also said fluoroelastomeric compositions showing a lower permeability to fluids, in particular to hydrocarbons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has unexpectedly and surprisingly found that it is possible to obtain the combination of the above properties by using the specific compositions defined hereunder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention are therefore fluoroelastomeric compositions comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A) a fluoroelastomeric matrix; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> B) a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer, in an amount from higher than 40% to 90% by weight based on the total of A)&plus;B); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> the fluoroelastomer A) incorporates the fluoropolymer B), the fluoropolymer B) being formed by tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) homopolymers, or by TFE copolymers with one or more monomers containing at least one unsaturation of ethylene type, in an amount from 0.01% to 10% by moles, preferably from 0.05% to 7% by moles, the average sizes of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer particles being from 10 to 100 nm, preferably from 10 to 60 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The fluoroelastomeric compositions of the invention are obtainable by mixing the latex of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) with the latex of the fluoroelastomer A) and subsequent coagulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Alternatively to the latex mixing, the fluoroelastomeric compositions of the invention can be obtained in the same reactor, using two subsequent steps: in the first step the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) having the above nanometric sizes is polymerized, while in the second step the fluoroelastomer A) is polymerized. By operating in this way the fluoroelastomer A) covers the latex particles of the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) allowing to obtain a very good disperdibility of the latter in the fluoroelastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) amount incorporated in the fluoroelastomeric matrix is higher than 40% by weight, preferably from &gt;40% to 80% by weight based on the total of the polymer mixture, more preferably from 45 to 70% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) particles having the above nanometric sizes are obtainable for example by polymerization in aqueous microemulsion of perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes as described for example in the European patent application 969,027 in the name of the Applicant, herein incorporated by reference. Polymerization techniques in microemulsion wherein the oil phase is formed by polymerizable unsaturated monomers can also be used, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,523,346 and 5,616,648. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has found that in order to obtain the results of the invention it is essential that the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) has the mentioned nanometric sizes, while the size of the fluoroelastomer A) particles to be mixed with the fluoropolymer is not critical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It has been unexpectedly found by the Applicant, see the comparative Examples, that the combination of properties of the invention compositions is obtainable only if the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) is present in amounts higher than 40% by weight with respect to the composition A)&plus;B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> By semi-crystalline fluoropolymer, a fluoropolymer is meant, which shows, besides the glass transition temperature Tg, at least one melting temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The preparation of the fluoroelastomers A) of the composition of the present invention can be carried out by copolymerization of the monomers in aqueous emulsion, according to known methods of the prior art, in the presence of radical initiators, for example, alkaline or ammonium persulphates, perphosphates, perborates or percarbonates, optionally in combination with ferrous, cuprous or silver salts, or of other easily oxidizable metals. In the reaction medium also surfactants of various types are usually present, among which fluorinated surfactants are particularly preferred. The polymerization reaction is generally carried out at temperatures in the range 25&deg;-150&deg; C., under a pressure up to 10 MPa. The preparation of the fluoroelastomeric matrix is preferably carried out in microemulsion of (per)fluoropolyoxyalkylenes, according to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,789,717 and 4,864,006. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the semi-crystalline fluoropolymer B) present in the fluoroelastomeric compositions of the invention is based on modified PTFE, i.e. it contains at least one comonomer, for its preparation comonomers having an ethylene unsaturation both of hydrogenated and fluorinated type can be used. Among the hydrogenated ones, ethylene, propylene, acrylic monomers, for example methylmethacrylate, (meth)acrylic acid, butylacrylate, hydroxyethylhexylacrylate, styrene monomers can be mentioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Among the fluorinated comonomers it can be mentioned: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the present invention can be cured by peroxidic or ionic route or by the combination of the two techniques. For crosslinking by peroxidic or mixed route, the fluoroelastomers A) contain in the polymer chain and/or in terminal position of the macromolecules iodine and/or bromine atoms. The introduction in the fluoroelastomeric matrix of said iodine and/or bromine atoms can be obtained by addition of brominated and/or iodinated &ldquo;cure-site&rdquo; comonomers, such as bromo and/or iodo olefins having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, as described for example in U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Curing by ionic route, preferred curing route according to the present invention, is carried out by addition of curing and accelerating agents well known in the prior art. The amounts of the accelerating agents are in the range 0.05-5 phr, the curing agent in the range 0.5-15 phr, preferably 1-6 phr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As curing agents, aromatic or aliphatic polyhydroxylated compounds or their derivatives can be used, as described for example in EP 335,705 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,427. Among them we remember in particular: di-, tri- and tetra-hydroxy benzenes, naphthalenes or anthracenes; bisphenols, wherein the two aromatic rings are linked each other by an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic bivalent radical, or by one oxygen or sulphur atom, or also by a carbonyl group. Aromatic rings can be substituted by one or more chlorine, fluorine, bromine atoms or by carbonyls, alkyls, acyls. In particular bisphenol AF is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As accelerating agents it can be used for example: quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts (see for example EP 335,705 and U.S. Pat.

No. 3,752,787); iminic compounds described in EP 182,299 and EP 120,462; etc. Quaternary phosphonium salts and aminophosphonium salts are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Instead of using the accelerating agent and the curing agent separately, it can also be used from 1 to 5 phr (preferred from 2 to 4.5) of an adduct between an accelerating agent and a curing agent in molar ratio from 1:2 to 1:5, preferably from 1:3 to 1:5, the accelerating agent being one of the onium-organic compounds having a positive charge, as above defined, the curing agent being selected from the above compounds, in particular di- or polyhydroxy or di- or polythiol compounds; the adduct being obtained by melting the reaction compound between the accelerating and the curing agent in the mentioned molar ratios, or by melting the mixture of the adduct 1:1 added with the curing agent in the indicated amounts. Optionally also an excess of the accelerating agent with respect to that contained in the adduct can be present, generally in amounts from 0.05 to 0.5 phr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> For the preparation of the adduct, particularly preferred as cations are: 1,1-diphenyl-1-benzyl-N-diethyl-phosphoranamine and tetrabutyl phosphonium; among the anions, bisphenol compounds are particularly preferred, wherein the two aromatic rings are linked by a bivalent radical selected from the perfluoroalkyl groups having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, and the OH are in para position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The adduct preparation is described in the European patent application in the name of the Applicant EP 684,277 herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The curable blend furthermore contains: </paragraph>
