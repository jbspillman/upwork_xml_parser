<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool such as a face-milling tool, etc. suitable for high-feed working, and throwaway insert used therein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool suitable for high feed, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-126920 discloses a face-milling cutter equipped with circular throwaway inserts. This face-milling cutter comprises round throwaway inserts each having a mounting hole at a center, cylindrical holders each having at a tip end a supporting seat for fixing the round throwaway insert by a flat head screw in such a direction that its upper surface serves as a flank and its side surface serves as a face, a cutter body for fixing the cylindrical holders, and wedges each inserted into a plurality of circular holes provided in a peripheral portion of a front surface of the cutter body in parallel with its axis and pressed into a gap between a flat surface provided on a periphery of each cylindrical holder and the cutter body. When fixed to the holder, the throwaway insert is inclined toward the rotational rearward direction and the periphery of the cutter, with a cutting edge formed by a crossing edge of the upper surface and the side surface being outward curved in both front surface direction and rotation direction of the cutter. Thus, with each round throwaway insert attached to the tool inclined in two directions, a large-radius, circular cutting edge is provided, providing reduced impact at high-feed cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Because this face-milling tool comprises round throwaway inserts, the surfaces of each insert with which the insert is fixed to the tool are a bottom surface and a side surface. However, because the side surface of the insert is a curved surface, precise positioning is difficult, needing an edge position-controlling screw. Further, because the round insert is attached inclined in two directions, the insert is likely to rotate during cutting, resulting in the likelihood that the edge position deviates. Accordingly, this tool is suitable for working at a cutting depth of as small as 0.1-1 mm or less, and if the tool is designed bigger for deeper cutting, an edge engaged to cutting becomes too long, resulting in too large cutting resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As another example of high-efficiency, insert-exchangeable, rotary tools, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-5921 discloses, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> high-feed throwaway-type rotary tool comprising a plurality of throwaway inserts <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, each throwaway insert <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> having a straight or circular peripheral cutting edge so as to have a back taper &dgr; to a circular major cutting edge <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and a center axis of tool <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> having a cutting edge angle &kgr; of 3-35&deg;. With the circular major cutting edge <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the throwaway insert <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, chips generated at the initial stage of cutting are thin and become gradually thicker as the tool rotates. Accordingly, a large impact force is not applied to the tool, enabling high feed in the cutting of steel suffering from little variation of cutting conditions. For instance, in the case of cutting steel, which is free from intermittent cutting, stable cutting is achieved even under the conditions of a feed fz per one tooth of 2 mm/tooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been found, however, that this high-feed, throwaway-type, rotary tool is not necessarily satisfactory to achieve a higher feed per one tooth. In addition, because this throwaway insert <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> has circular major cutting edges <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> on two opposing surfaces with two other flat opposing surfaces for abutting the tool, it is not economically advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly desirable are a long-life, insert-exchangeable, rotary tool such as a face-milling tool capable of performing stable cutting without cracking throwaway inserts even for high-feed working at a cutting depth of about 1-6 mm, particularly for works suffering from large variations of cutting conditions such as works having many holes and pre-hardened steel, etc., and throwaway inserts used therefor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool such as a face-milling tool, which can be operated at a high feed while keeping high precision, and can stably cut works suffering from large variations of cutting conditions such as works with many holes, pre-hardened steel, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a throwaway insert used for such an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool, which has a long life and excellent crack resistance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a result of intense research in view of the above objects, the inventors have found that by attaching substantially square-shaped throwaway inserts comprising flanks each having a flat surface portion in a substantially center portion to an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool, such that a radial rake is negative, and that a major cutting edge formed by an outward curved edge line circularly extends from a lowermost point toward a periphery of the tool, impact applied to the throwaway inserts is eased in a cutting process, thereby achieving high-feed cutting and a long life even with intermittent cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, the throwaway insert detachably attached to an insert-exchangeable, rotary tool according to the present invention comprises substantially square-shaped face and bottom surface and an outward curved flank on each side surface, the throwaway insert having a positive-type shape in which an outward curved edge line formed by the face and the flank serves as a cutting edge, each flank having in a substantially center portion a flat surface portion extending to the bottom surface without contacting with the cutting edge, and a major cutting edge formed by the outward curved edge line circularly extending from its lowermost point toward a periphery of the tool when the insert is attached to the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool, such that it has a negative radial rake. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An angle between the flat surface portion and the face is preferably 3&deg;-10&deg; smaller than an angle between the face and the flank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Part of the outward circular cutting edge is preferably straight. Also, the major cutting edge is preferably constituted by a plurality of lines and/or curved lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The throwaway insert preferably has a breaker-shaped face groove along the major cutting edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The radius of curvature of the outward curved edge line is preferably 0.6-1.6 times the diameter of an inscribed circle in the insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The insert-exchangeable, rotary tool according to the present invention comprises throwaway inserts detachably attached to the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool, the insert comprising substantially square-shaped face and bottom surface and an outward curved flank on each side surface, and having a positive-type shape in which an outward curved edge line formed by the face and the flank serves as a cutting edge; each flank having in a substantially center portion a flat surface portion extending to the bottom surface without contacting with the cutting edge; a major cutting edge formed by the outward curved edge line circularly extending from its lowermost point toward a periphery of the tool when the insert is attached to the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool, such that it has a negative radial rake; and the lowermost point being positioned inward a center of the outward curved major cutting edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The major cutting edge preferably has a cutting edge angle of 35&deg; or less. Also, the radial rake is preferably from &minus;5&deg; to &minus;45&deg;. Further, the major cutting edge preferably has a true rake from &plus;3&deg; to &plus;15&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the radial rake of the major cutting edge continuously or intermittently changes toward the periphery of the tool.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a side view of this throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> viewed from the direction A, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a partial, enlarged, cross-sectional view showing an encircled portion in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a side view of throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> viewed from the direction B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a substantially square shape as a whole, with an outward curved cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on each side. With respect to the shape of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the term &ldquo;outward curved&rdquo; means that the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an outward bulging edge. However, it is not necessary that the entire cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a single radius of curvature, but it may be consisting of a plurality of curved lines and may be partially straight. Further, the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may have a breaker-shaped face groove along the outward curved major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Though a connecting portion of the adjacent cutting edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably chamfered with a curve having a proper radius of curvature, chamfer may not be needed in some cases with direct connection of both cutting edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The circular cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a radius of curvature R preferably 0.6-1.6 times the diameter D of an inscribed circle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When R/D is less than 0.6 times, the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has substantially the same shape as a round insert, resulting in a large cutting edge angle in applications with a large cutting depth, thereby making it impossible to carry out cutting at a high feed. To make the cutting depth larger with a cutting edge angle unchanged, the inscribed circle <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should be increased. When R/D is more than 1.6 times, the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has substantially the same shape as a straight cutting edge, losing the advantages of the curved cutting edge, which are a long life because of long contact length between the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a work during cutting, a high strength in intermittent cutting, and high resistance to breakage even when heat cracking occurs because of a compression force during cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A flat surface portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided in a substantially center portion of the flank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on each side of the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extends from a position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>separate from the outward curved cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a slight distance Ts to a bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The flat surface portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serves as an abutting surface when the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to a tool body, enabling the precise positioning of the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An angle &agr; of the flat surface portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably 3&deg;-10&deg; smaller than an angle &bgr; of the face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the flank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When this difference (angle &thgr;) is less than 3&deg;, sufficient abutting surface area is not obtained. On the other hand, when it is less than 10&deg;, the edge strength decreases. </paragraph>

Alternatively, the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be provided with a cramp hole in center portion for a cramping mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are enlarged cross-sectional views showing in detail how an insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> attached to the face-milling tool shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> cuts a work W. FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> indicate that with a cutting edge angle &kgr; set such that the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is positioned inward the tool than a center of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a portion of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> engaging cutting can be long to avoid that a center portion of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the weakest strength is first brought into contact with a work W and thus subjected to impact. The cutting edge angle &kgr; is preferably 35&deg; or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The inventors have investigated the mechanism of generating impact to the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a cutting process, separately on (1) impact when the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts to bite the work W (at the start of cutting), (2) impact during a period from engagement to the work W to separation therefrom. As a result, the inventors have found that the impact (1) can be reduced by causing the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of an outward curved major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as a starting point of cutting to shallowly bite into a work W, and the impact (2) can be reduced by providing a negative radial rake Rr. With the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool of the present invention having these features, chips <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> generated by contact with the work W at the initial stage of cutting are thin and become gradually thicker as the tool rotates, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Thus, a large impact force is not applied to the tool, enabling the high feed of the tool and stable intermittent cutting with a long life of throwaway inserts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attached to the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool preferably such that radial rake Rr of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is as negative as from &minus;5&deg; to &minus;45&deg;. The radial rake Rr of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may change continuously or intermittently as it nears the periphery of the throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The true rake of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably &plus;3&deg; to &plus;15&deg;. Incidentally, the true rake is an angle obtained by synthesizing the axial rake and the radial rake. The true rake and the axial rake are defined in JIS B0170. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To improve the surface conditions of the worked surface, the throwaway inserts <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the above embodiments may be modified as described below. For instance, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an example with a minor cutting edge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an example with an inside peripheral cutting edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 11</cross-reference> show an example chamfered in a corner portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at an angle &ggr; substantially equal to or more than the radial rake, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> with a minor cutting edge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> added. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1, 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The specifications of the throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> were set as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Diameter D of inscribed circle 13:15.875 mm, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Radius of curvature R of circular cutting edge 11: 15 mm, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Angle &agr; between face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and flat surface portion 12: 70&deg;, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Angle &bgr; between face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and flank 15: 75&deg;, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Thickness T: 4.76 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the flat surface portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extended along the flank <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from a position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>receding 0.5 mm from the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was attached to the body of the face-milling tool shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A radial rake Rr was set at &minus;4&deg;, and an axial rake was set at 9&deg;. A cutting edge angle was set at 15&deg;, such that the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> was positioned radially inward than a center of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For comparison, a regular triangular-shaped throwaway insert <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> having a straight cutting edge <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> (Comparative Example 1), and a square-shaped throwaway insert <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> having a straight cutting edge <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> (Comparative Example 2) were respectively attached to a face-milling tool for a cutting test. A cutting edge angle was 90&deg; in Comparative Example 1 and 30&deg;-45&deg; in Comparative Example 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With these tools, a cutting test was carried out at the maximum feed speed possible under the following cutting specifications to compare the maximum feed speed F<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>and the amount Q of chips discharged per a unit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Diameter of tool edges: 200 mm (full set having 10 inserts), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Work: S50C, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Cutting depth Ad: 2 mm, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Cutting width Rd: 180 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The feed fz of the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> per one tooth could be made as large as 2.5 mm/tooth at a cutting speed V of as low as 100 m/min in Example 1. Under this condition, stable cutting was kept until the table feed speed F reached 4000 mm/min and the amount Q of chips discharged reached 1440 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, F was 800 mm/min, and Q was 288 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/min in Comparative Example 1, because the insert <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> was cracked when the feed fz per one tooth was larger than 0.25 mm/tooth at a cutting speed V of 180 m/min. Also, the feed fz per one tooth was limited to 0.4 mm/tooth or less with F&equals;1280 mm/min and Q&equals;460.8 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/min in Comparative Example 2, because of the limit of the strength of the insert <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at a cutting speed V of 180 m/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the above the results that the table feed speed F per a unit time and the amount Q of chips discharged were 3-5 times improved in Example 1 than in Comparative Examples 1 and 2. Because the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of Example 1 had outward curved major cutting edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, each cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> bites a work W shallowly from the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the start of cutting, resulting in small impact. Therefore, the feed fz per one tooth could be made as large as about 1.0-3.5 mm/tooth even in the cutting of steel such as S50C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With a radial rake of a large negative angle, specifically from about 0&deg; to about &minus;40&deg; such that a true rake is large and not negative, there is a long biting time of the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the work W from the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the boundary <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As a result, the insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sufficiently strong in intermittent cutting, and the throwaway insert <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a long life because of a long contact length between the cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the work W. On the other hand, chips of uniform thickness are generated during cutting in the case of the inserts <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of Comparative Examples 1 and 2. A smaller cutting edge angle would make chips thinner accordingly. Thus, the feed fz per one tooth was as small as about 0.2-0.4 mm/tooth in the cutting of steel such as S50C. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES 2-4, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Using the insert of Example 1, the axial rake of a tool body was set at 9&deg;, and the cutting edge angle &kgr; was set at 15&deg; such that the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of cutting edge was positioned inward than a center of the cutting edge. The radial rake Rr was &minus;10&deg; in Example 2 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, &minus;15&deg; in Example 3 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and &minus;20&deg; in Example 4 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. For comparison, a tool with a radial rake Rr of &minus;4&deg; (Comparative Example 3), and the tools of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were also tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Using the tools of Examples 2-4 and Comparative Examples 1-3 (each 6-tooth face-milling tool, to which only one insert was attached), a cutting test was carried out on a work having a large number of holes each having a diameter of 8 mm shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, which easily caused cracking in inserts, to measure the feed fz per one tooth, which expresses cutting efficiency, until each insert was subjected to initial cracking. The cutting specifications were as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Diameter of tool edges: 125 mm, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Work: pre-hardened steel &lsqb;SCM440 (HS40)&rsqb;, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Cutting speed: 150 m/min, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Cutting depth Ad: 1 mm, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Cutting width Rd: 90 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The cutting results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. No cracking occurred in the inserts of Examples 2-4 and Comparative Example 3, even though the feed fz per one tooth was increased from 0.1 mm/tooth to 0.8 mm/tooth. On the other hand, cracking occurred at a feed fz per one tooth of 0.25 mm/tooth in the insert of Comparative Example 1. Cracking also occurred at a feed fz per one tooth of 0.4 mm/tooth in the insert of Comparative Example 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Under as hard conditions as beyond common sense with a feed fz per one tooth increased to 1.5 mm/tooth, a cutting test was carried out to compare the life of each tool. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. While the life was 3 minutes in Comparative Example 3, it was 33 minutes in Example 2, 40 minutes in Example 3, and 17 minutes in Example 4. It was confirmed from these results that as the radial rake Rr increased in a negative direction, the life of inserts increased even under extremely hard intermittent cutting conditions. The true rake was 6.1&deg; in Example 2, 4.8&deg; in Example 3, 3.4&deg; in Example 4, and 7.7&deg; in Comparative Example 3. It was confirmed from these results that when the true rake was 3&deg; or more, the life of inserts was long even under extremely hard intermittent cutting conditions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The same effect was obtained, with a major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consisting of a curved line extending from the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> toward the periphery and a straight line as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> (Example 5), with a major cutting edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consisting of a plurality of straight lines from around the lowermost point <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> toward the periphery at a cutting edge angle &kgr; of 35&deg; or less as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> (Example 6), with a negative radial rake Rr changed intermittently as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> (Example 7), or with a radial rake Rr changed smoothly and continuously with a convex upper surface of an insert (Example 8). This effect is widely obtained ranging from a small diameter to a large diameter regardless of the diameter of cutting tool edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As described above in detail, the insert-exchangeable, rotary tool such as a face-milling tool, etc. equipped with the throwaway insert of the present invention can cut a work efficiently at a high feed, with a long life because of improved crack resistance.
