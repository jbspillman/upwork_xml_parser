<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application is based on and claims priority from Japanese Patent Application 2001-198712, filed Jun. 29, 2001, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a vehicle generator control system for controlling output voltage of a vehicle AC generator to be mounted in a passenger car or a truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a conventional generator control system for controlling output voltage of a vehicle AC generator, field current is supplied to a generator when a key switch sensor detects turn-on of a key switch. However, it is necessary to provide signal wires for detecting the operation of the key switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another generator control system such as disclosed in JP-U-62-44698, field current is supplied when rotation of a rotor of a vehicle AC generator is detected by a magnetic sensor that detects residual magnetic flux of the rotor. This can omit special signal wires. However, the electromotive force generated by the residual magnetic flux is so small that it is difficult to detect rotation of the rotor accurately. The residual magnetic flux becomes weaker if the AC generator is not operated for a comparatively long time, for example, when a vehicle is shipped abroad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,182,511 and 5,602,470 disclose detector circuits that detect a voltage difference between two phase-windings of a vehicle AC generator, thereby detecting rotation of an engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, those disclosed generator control systems necessitate a special detector circuit, which is a normally closed circuit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a protection circuit to prevent a large amount of current from flowing into the detector circuit when the AC generator starts generation. This also makes the voltage control system complicated and expensive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a simple and improved vehicle generator control system that needs not any special wire or circuit for detecting operation of a key switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a feature of the invention, a generator control system of a vehicle AC generator includes switching means connected in series with a field coil, a voltage regulator for controlling the switching means to thereby control the output voltage of the vehicle AC generator, comparing means for providing a pulse signal by comparing voltage of a phase-winding with voltage of another phase-winding and engine start detecting means for starting operation of a voltage regulator when frequencies of the pulse signal becomes larger than a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, no closed circuit is formed, so that a large amount of current can be prevented from flowing into the engine start detecting means without providing any protection circuit. In addition, only a low level of voltage difference between two phase-windings is necessary to provide a pulse signal without using a special signal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the two phase-windings are 90 degree in electric angle different in phase from each other, in order to detect the engine start accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable for the generator control system to include bypassing means for connecting the two phase-windings to a ground if the output voltage of the phase-windings is larger than a threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, if leak current flows into a phase-winding Y, the voltage Vpy that is inputted to an engine start detecting circuit drifts from the phase voltage Py of the phase-winding Y by Vb&times;R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/(R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), where Vb is terminal voltage of a battery B, R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a contact resistance of a portion to which the leak current flows, and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an internal resistance of the engine start detecting circuit. The bypassing means reduces the drift voltage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable for generator control system to include means for supplying field current for a predetermined period if the output voltage of one of the two phase-windings becomes higher than a second threshold voltage that is lower than the first threshold voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is possible to discriminate normal output voltage of one of the phase-windings from drifted output voltage that is caused by by leak current.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A vehicle generator control system according to the first embodiment of the invention is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is comprised of a pair of armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a pair of rectifiers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a field coil <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Each of the pair of armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a polyphase winding (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows three-phase windings) wound in a common stator core and insulated from the other. The pair of armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed in the stator core to generate voltage of the same phase. The rectifier <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is a full-wave rectifier that is connected to the armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to convert the AC voltage outputted thereby into DC voltage. The rectifier <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is also a full-wave rectifier that is connected to the armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to convert the AC voltage outputted thereby into DC voltage. The field coil <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> forms a magnetic field that interlinks the armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when supplied with field current. The field coil <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is wound around a magnetic pole core and forms a rotor together with the pole core. The generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> controls the output voltage of the AC generator at a predetermined control voltage Vreg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The vehicle generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is comprised of a power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a flywheel diode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a voltage regulating circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a main power source circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected in series to the field coil <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to intermittently supply field current. The flywheel diode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel to the field coil <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to circulate the field current when the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is opened. The voltage regulating circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> watches the output voltage of the vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and controls the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to keep the output voltage at regulated voltage Vreg. For example, the voltage regulating circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> closes the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> when the output voltage of the vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the regulated voltage Vreg and opens the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> when the output voltage becomes higher than the regulated voltage Vreg. The main power source circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> supplies electric power to the voltage regulating circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to maintain the control operation thereof. The auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> detects rotation of the vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, namely, an engine according to the voltage of one of phase-windings (e.g. Y-phase voltage Py and U-phase voltage Pu) of each of the pair of armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and drives the main power source circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is comprised of a voltage comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, resistors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a counter <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and an analog switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The voltage comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a positive terminal to which phase voltage Py that is induced in a Y-phase winding of one of the armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is applied via an first input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a negative terminal to which phase voltage Pu that is induced in a U-phase winding of the other armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is applied via a second input terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The voltage comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides a high level signal if the phase voltage Py on the positive terminal is higher than the phase voltage Pu on the negative terminal and a low level signal if the phase voltage Py on the positive terminal is not higher than the phase voltage Pu on the negative terminal. The resistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is connected between the first input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a ground to bypass a small amount of leak current through the resistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the ground. The resistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is also connected between the second input terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a ground to bypass a small amount of leak current through the resistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The Y-phase winding of the first armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the U-phase winding of the second armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are 120 degree in electric angle spaced apart from each other. Therefore, the wave shape of the phase voltage Py and the wave shape of the phase voltage Pu are shifted from each other by 120 degree in electric angle, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> outputs pulse signals (Co) that have the same frequencies as the phase voltages Py, Pu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Because the phase voltage of the first armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the phase voltage of the second armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is insulated from the first armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are compared by the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, it is not possible to form any closed circuit. As a result, it is not necessary to provide a protection circuit for protecting the auxiliary power source circuit from a large amount of current. On the other hand, even if the electromotive forces induced in both the first and second armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are very small, the voltage difference between two can be detected. Therefore, a pulse signal that responds the engine rotation can be provided without a special signal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The vehicle generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be used in a different vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A has a pair of armature windings <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are 30 degree electric angle shifted from each other. Because the first armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A and the second armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are 30 degree electric angle in phase different from each other, electromagnetic noises and ripples can be reduced. It is also possible to make the phase difference 90 degree in electric angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the phase voltages Py&prime; and Pu to be inputted to the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are shifted by 90 degree in electric angle from each other. Therefore, two phase voltages can be compared easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A according to the second embodiment of the invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A is the same as the generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment except that an auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A is different from the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A includes the voltage regulator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the resistors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the counter <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the analog switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that are included in the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. The auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A further includes a pair of peak detecting circuits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a pair of voltage comparators <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, a pair of resistors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and a pair of transistors <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first peak detecting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is comprised of a diode, a capacitor and a resistor and detects the peak value of the phase voltage Py that is induced in the Y-phase winding of the first armature winding <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The second peak detecting circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has the same structure as the first peak detecting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and detects the peak value of the phase voltage Pu of the U-phase winding of the second armature winding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The voltage comparator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a negative terminal to which the peak value of the phase voltage Py is inputted and a positive terminal to which a suitable threshold value Vth is inputted. If the peak value is lower than the threshold value Vth, the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> outputs a high level signal to close the transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has a gate connected to the output terminal of the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> , a drain connected the first input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> via the resistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a source connected to a ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The voltage comparator <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> has a negative terminal to which the peak value of the phase voltage Pu is inputted, which is compared with the threshold value Vth that is inputted to the positive terminal of the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. If the peak value is lower than the threshold value Vth the voltage comparator outputs a high level signal to close the transistor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> has a gate connected to the output terminal of the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, a drain connected to the second input terminal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> via the resistor <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and a source connected to the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> outputs a high level signal to close the transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the first input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is grounded by the resistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The resistance R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the resistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is sufficiently smaller than the resistance R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the resistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> that is connected to the first input terminal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. For example, R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is about 1 k&OHgr; and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is about 10 &OHgr;. Therefore, if the amount of leak current is very small, the transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is kept closed to let the leak current flow to the ground through the resistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. For example, if the threshold value Vth of the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is 3 V, the transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is not opened until the amount of leak current becomes larger than 300 mA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the engine stops, the transistors <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> are turned on to bypass the leak current via the resistors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> whose resistance is very low. Therefore, the potential of the input terminals <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is prevented from being raised by drift voltage, so that the engine starting can be accurately detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the engine starts and the vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts generation, the transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> are turned off. Therefore, the output power of the vehicle AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented from being wasted by the resistors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, field current can be supplied for a predetermined period when one of the output voltages of the peak detecting circuits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> becomes higher than a threshold voltage Vth2 that is lower than the threshold voltage Vth. If the rotor of the AC generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts rotation, the phase voltages Py, Pu gradually increase while the drift voltage does not increase. This arrangement can discriminate the voltage induced in the Y-phase or U-phase winding from drift voltage caused by leak current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B according to the third embodiment of the invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B is almost the same as the generator control system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A according to the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B is slightly different from the auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A of the second embodiment, and an OR gate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is inserted between the gate of the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the voltage regulator circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The auxiliary power source circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>B includes a voltage comparator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> whose threshold value is Vth2 and a time circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The voltage comparator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is connected to the output terminal of the peak detecting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. When the output voltage of the peak detecting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> becomes higher than the threshold value Vth2, the voltage comparator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provides a high level output signal to start the timer circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The timer circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> provides a high level signal for a predetermined period. When the output signal of the timer circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> provides a high level signal, the power transistor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is turned on for the predetermined period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description of the present invention, the invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to the specific embodiments of the present invention without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
