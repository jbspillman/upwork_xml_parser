<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> More specifically, when the above-mentioned styrene resin-made article or propylene resin-made article is sealed at a heat-seal temperature of about 120 to 200&deg; C. using either the film or the laminate in accordance with the present invention, a sealing strength of from 0.3 to 2.0 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(29 to 196 kPa) can be obtained for said articles. Incidentally, it is generally said that a sealing strength of less than 0.3 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(29 kPa) means an inferior sealing property, and that of more than 2.0 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(196 kPa) means an inferior easy-unsealing property. The above-mentioned sealing strength can be measured by a method comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (1) heat-sealing a plastic container and a cover to seal tightly the container with the cover, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (2) filling a gas into the sealed container to increase gradually a gas pressure in the container, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (3) measuring a pressure in the container at the time when the sealing interface is broken (usually, this case often occurs), or when the container is unsealed owing to peeling of the cover, the measured pressure being regarded as the sealing strength.</paragraph>
