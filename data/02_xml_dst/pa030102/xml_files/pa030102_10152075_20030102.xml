<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Interferometric method(s) and apparatus for accurately measuring aspherical surfaces and transmitted wavefronts, particularly of the type having relatively large diameters and departure employed in lithographic applications used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and the like. An interferometer, preferably of the Fizeau type, is provided with at least one aspherical reference surface that is positioned adjacent the test optic. The test optic can be either rotationally or non-rotationally symmetric, a reflecting aspherical test surface, or a refracting system that is illuminated by an aspherical wavefront or produces a transmitted aspherical wavefront. In any case, the departure of the test optic from its intended performance is ultimately determined. The aspherical reference surface is illuminated by an aspherical wavefront provided by upstream optics structured so that the incident aspherical wavefront propagates normal to the aspherical reference surface across its entire surface. The illuminating aspherical wavefront is partially reflected and partially transmitted by the reference surface to provide an aspherical measurement wavefront that is incident to the test optic and has a shape nominally the same as that of the test surface in the reflective case or of the design transmitted wavefront in the refractive case. The aspherical test surface reflects the incident aspherical wavefront and it combines with the reference aspherical wavefront to provide an interferogram containing phase information indicative of the shape of the wavefront generated by the test optic. The interferogram is imaged onto a preferably two dimensional photodetection system that provides an output signal that is analyzed to extract the relevant phase information and convert it to numerical and display form. Phase shifting interferometric techniques are preferably used in the performance of the analysis along with alignment apparatus and procedures for assuring accurate measurement of the test optic. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to the field of interferometry and, in particular, to apparatus and method(s) for the high accuracy measurement of aspherical optical surfaces and wavefronts using the interference of light. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A single aspherical optical surface can be used to replace several conventional spherical or plano optical surfaces or elements in an optical system to improve the system&apos;s optical performance by reducing optical aberrations and increasing optical transmission, for example. In lithography tools where use is made of shorter wavelengths to make integrated circuits, the limited choice of materials from which refractive optical elements can be made necessitates the use of refractive and reflective aspherical optical surfaces to achieve the ever increasing performance demands for this application. Surface errors for optical surfaces needed for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools operating at wavelengths of 13.6 nm, for example, must be less than 0.1 nm for reflective aspherical surfaces. Not only are the tolerances for the measurement accuracy increasing, but the magnitude of the aspherical departure from a reference sphere is increasing, for example, to nearly 1000 micrometers for some applications. As the integrated circuit line widths shrink, the size (diameter) of the optical elements is increasing to nearly 500 millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The measurement of aspherical surfaces and wavefronts has been very difficult because of the large departure from a best-fit reference sphere thereby producing an interferogram with many fringes that are very closely spaced. Prior art techniques have used some sort of aspherical null to mitigate this problem. Also, the Nyquist condition which requires at least two pixels per fringe, imposes a severe limit on what can be measured with available 2-D cameras. Since fringe spatial density is proportional to the slope of the aspherical surface, or wavefront, even weakly aspherical surfaces and wavefronts will violate the Nyquist condition. Typically, prior art systems are limited to surfaces with no more than 10-20 waves of aspherical departure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, for many of the prior art techniques, the wavefront difference measured in the interferogram is not simply the difference between the test and reference wavefronts. An aspherical measurement system requires that the entire interferometric measurement system, including all of the interferometer&apos;s optics, be ray traced for the aspherical surface under test. This requirement understandably complicates the calibration of the measurement system and also reduces the accuracy of the measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While high accuracy aspherical optical surfaces have been difficult and expensive to make, thereby limiting their use, there have been improvements in the fabrication of aspherical surfaces which will make them more prevalent. With fabrication improvements in, for example, magneto-rheological finishing, ion figuring, and computer controlled polishing, there is a concomitant need for improved aspherical measurement methods and apparatus to provide the error maps for these manufacturing methods to enable them to produce the aspherical optical surfaces needed to meet the requirements of integrated circuit lithography tools such a steppers and scanners operating at wavelengths of 193 nm, 157 nm, and 13.6 nm, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are many methods and apparatus in the prior art for measuring aspherical optical surfaces, for example: 1. Contacting and non-contacting stylus based profilers; 2. Contacting and non-contacting stylus based coordinate measuring machines; 3. Spherical wavefront interferometers; 4. Lateral and radial shearing interferometers; 5. Interferometers with null lenses in the measurement path; 6. Scanning spherical wave interferometers; 7. Scanning white light interferometers; 8. Sub-aperture stitching interferometers; 9. Interferometers using computer generated holograms-CGHs; 10. Point diffraction interferometers-PDIs; 11. Longer wavelength interferometry; and 12. Two wavelength interferometry. While these techniques have utility for many applications, they are limited in their operational capabilities or precision compared with those needed for today&apos;s evolving lithography applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Contacting and non-contacting stylus based profilers mechanically scan the aspherical surface under test and, therefore, are slow because they measure only a few data points at a time. Slow techniques are very susceptible to measurement errors due to temperature variations during the measurement. The same limitations apply to contacting and non-contacting stylus based coordinate measuring machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Spherical wavefront interferometers usually require the spacing between the element generating the spherical wavefront and the aspherical surface under test to be scanned thereby increasing the measurement time for the entire surface under test thus introducing another parameter which must be measured, usually by another measurement device, and means, commonly known as stitching, for connecting the data from the various zones which fit as the spacing is scanned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Scanning white light interferometers have many of the same limitations as spherical wavefront interferometers. Lateral and radial shearing interferometers usually measure the slope of the surface under test and thereby introduce measurement errors during the reconstruction of the surface under test via integration of the slopes. This latter type of limitation applies to differential types of profiling techniques as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Sub-aperture stitching interferometers introduce serious measurement errors in the stitching process. Interferometers using computer generated holograms are susceptible to errors introduced by the CGH and stray Moir&eacute; patterns. It is also difficult to calibrate, i.e., know the calibration of the CGH. Point diffraction interferometers are a class of spherical wavefront interferometers, and therefore, have many of the same limitations, as well as poor lateral spatial resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> None of the prior art approaches is entirely satisfactory since each involves a trade-off that places long lead times on the design of the measurement apparatus and method, requires additional fabrication, increases the difficulty of using and calibrating the measurement apparatus, decreases the accuracy and precision, and greatly increases the cost and delivery time of the aspherical optical element </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for the high accuracy measurement of aspherical optical surfaces and wavefronts. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to interferometric methodologies for the accurate measurement of aspherical surfaces and wavefronts. Method(s) and apparatus of the invention are provided for measuring aspherical optical surfaces and wavefronts that may be of large diameter and include substantial aspheric departures. The apparatus of the invention in one aspect comprises an interferometer, preferably a Fizeau interferometer, having an optical system which contains an aspherical reference surface which is illuminated by an incident aspherical wavefront generated by either refractive or diffractive optics located upstream of it. The incident aspherical wavefront is normal to the aspherical reference surface. The aspherical reference surface acts as both a beamsplitter and a reference surface for the interferometer. The aspherical reference surface reflects a portion of the incident aspherical wavefront into a reference wavefront and transmits a portion of the incident aspherical wavefront into an aspherical measurement wavefront. The aspherical reference surface and the aspherical surface under test are preferably separated by a small distance, d, so as to minimize environmentally induced measurement errors and noise. The aspherical measurement wavefront propagates normal to and is reflected by the aspherical surface under test, and the reflected aspherical measurement wavefront is recombined with the reference aspherical wavefront to form an interferogram which is indicative of the shape of the aspherical surface under test. The phase of the resulting interferogram is modulated, preferably by wavelength modulation, using any of the well known techniques for this purpose. In the instant invention, angular and positional alignment of the aspherical surface under test to the aspherical reference surface is done by analysis of the interferogram. The aspherical surface under test can then be mechanically aligned with coarse and fine positioning actuators which can be either under manual or computer control. Analysis of the final interferogram provides values of any residual misalignments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the apparatus of the invention, aspheric wavefronts from one or more refractive elements are measured to determine the departure of their transmitted wavefronts compared with those anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention apparatus and methods are provided for aligning the aspheric reference surface with the aspheric wavefront illuminating it.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The reference aspherical surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be fabricated and tested using well-known metrology techniques previously mentioned or by using the technique described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. (Attorney Docket Number 0227/PROV of the Law Office of Francis J. Caufield), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Thus, system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises an interferometer, preferably a Fizeau interferometer, having an optical system which contains an aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is illuminated by an incident aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> generated by optics located upstream of it; namely, the combination of lenses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a rear surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> operates on collimated beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (plane wavefront) to converge it after which it proceeds towards lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a diverging wavefront <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> operates on wavefront <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, further shaping it so that it emerges from lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as wavefront <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Wavefront <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then encounters the rear surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and then impinges on reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the foregoing combination of elements is designed to operate on collimated beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide an incident aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that is normal to the aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> acts as both a beamsplitter and a reference surface for the interferometer. The aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> reflects a portion of the incident aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into a reference wavefront <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and transmits a portion of the incident aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into an aspherical measurement wavefront <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the aspherical surface under test <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are preferably separated by a small distance, d, so as to minimize environmentally induced measurement errors and noise and higher order errors in the measurement resulting from errors in the aspherical shape of the wavefront impinging on surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The aspherical measurement wavefront <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is propagates normal to and is reflected by the aspherical surface under test <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the reflected aspherical measurement wavefront <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is combined with the reference aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to form an interferogram which is indicative of the shape of the aspherical surface under test. For this purpose, the two interfering beams should be nearly the same intensity to provide maximum fringe contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The combined interfering wavefront is more or less distorted wavefront initially inside of element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and thereafter travels as wavefront <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that proceeds through element <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, emerging therefrom as wavefront <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Wavefront <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is reflected downwardly by beamsplitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as wavefront <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which is thereafter imaged onto photodetection system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as the final interferogram via lens <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Photodetection system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is preferably two-dimensional, having a two-dimensional photosensitive array, and may be in the form of a shuttered or unshuttered electronic, video, or solid state camera provided with a CCD, or the like. A zoom lens also may be used under appropriate conditions, and rotating ground glass or similar coherence busters may be used either before the camera or in the path of the light source. The output of photodetection system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fed to computer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as electrical signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The phase of the resulting interferogram is modulated, preferably by wavelength modulation, using any of the well known techniques for this purpose. In the instant invention, angular and positional alignment of the aspherical surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> under test to the aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is done by analysis of the interferogram through the use of well-known algorithms resident as computer instructions on computer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Position and attitude of test element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably made via a well-known positioning device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> under control of computer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and provided with, for example, five to six degrees of freedom to control translation and angular orientation of element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and thus test surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the aspherical surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> under test can be mechanically aligned with coarse and fine positioning actuators which can be under either manual or computer control. Analysis of the final interferogram provides values of any residual misalignments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown an arrangement of the invention by which a refractive element or group of refractive elements such as those, e.g., found in a lithographic lens for fabricating integrated circuits, or the like, may be measured. Such refracting systems may include aspherical surfaces or not and may have incident aspherical wavefronts or emergent transmitted aspherical wavefronts. The refractive element to be measured is designated diagrammatically at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and is mounted on a well-known positioning device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> between reference elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As before, positioning device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is under the control of computer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Reference element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> carries an aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and reference element <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> carries an aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Reference aspherical surfaces <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are not necessarily identical. As before, an aspherical wavefront <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of well-defined shape is provided and is directed through test element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> after which it emerges as wavefront <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Wavefront <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reflected off aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> as wavefront <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is configured so that wavefront <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> strikes it at normal incidence over its entire surface. Wavefront <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> emerges from element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as wavefront <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is combined with a reference aspherical wavefront to form an interferogram as before. Aspheric wavefront <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the shape of surfaces <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are obtained based on the optical design of refractive element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as are the spacings d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The interferogram is imaged and analyzed in the manner previously described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to determine the shape of the wavefront transmitted by element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and compare it with its ideal. Positioning devices <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> may be used throughout for alignment and measurement purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Here, light source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably a laser having an output wavelength at or near the operating wavelength of the component to be tested, typically 193 nm, 157 nm, or 13.6 nm, and may be either cw or pulsed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To align elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a master element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is first made to required precision and then the master is placed in the measurement station and elements <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are appropriately adjusted to desired alignment. Afterwards, the master is removed and replaced with test elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, aspherical reference surface, Z<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>(r); Za(r) and Z<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>(r) need not be rotationally symmetric, and the foregoing analysis can be applied to such non-rotationally symmetric aspherical surfaces as well. In the case of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces or wavefronts, the shape is given by, Z<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>(x,y), and the corresponding equations analogous to those derived for the symmetric case in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are given by:

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Having described apparatus for practicing the invention, another aspect of the invention in the from of a method for its practice will now be described since the method may be carried out in interferometer architectures other than just Fizeau types. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, there is shown a flowchart illustrating various steps of a method for practicing the invention. As seen there, the method comprises the set of aligning a test optic and at least one aspheric surface reference surface placed closely adjacent the test optic by a predetermined distance (Block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). As noted above, the test optic can be reflective or refractive or may be a group of refractive elements collectively acting to provide a transmitted aspherical wavefront output in accordance with its design specification as, for example, a compound lithographic lens for fabricating integrated circuits and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As indicated in Block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, this is followed by illuminating the reference aspheric surface with a beam having a well-defined wavefront whose shape is preferably substantially the same as that of the reference aspheric surface. The well-defined wavefront may be diverging or converging even though illustrated previously as diverging. The well-defined wavefront has part of it reflected from the reference aspheric surface to serve as a reference wavefront and part of it is transmitted through the reference aspheric surface as a continuing wavefront that impinges on the test optic (reflective or refractive, as the case may be) after which it is returned as a measurement wavefront that travels back towards the reference aspheric surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, the reference and measurement wavefronts are combined to form an interferogram containing phase information indicative of the shape of the wavefront generated by the test optic (Block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). In the refractive case, a portion of the reference wavefront travels through the test surfaces, reflects from another reference surface, passes back through the test surfaces, and emerges as an aspherical wavefront to be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An image of the interferogram is then formed on a photodetector and an electrical signal is generated containing phase information corresponding to the difference between the wavefront generated by test optic and its actual performance (Block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, phase shifting interferometry or other suitable analytical interferometric methodology is performed to extract the phase information from the electrical signal and calculate the test optic performance and its departure from its design specification (Block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The calculated information is then outputted to file, as alphanumeric hardcopy display form, and/or graphical form ( Block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> which illustrates the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> configured to align the aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the wavefront <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> impinging on it. All elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> reappearing here carry the same numerical identification as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A preferred method by which the system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is aligned for measuring reflecting aspheric surfaces first requires inserting a retroreflector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> into the path of beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (See the double arrow travel indicated) and hence its corresponding wavefront. A plane mirror <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (Adjustments not shown) is then aligned to the wavefront from <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> using an interference pattern from wavefronts reflected from <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. This makes plane mirror <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> perpendicular to beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, retroreflector <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is removed from the path of beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to positioning device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via a mounting bracket <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Using positioning device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, reflected wavefront <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is aligned to plane mirror <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The result of this alignment procedure assures that aspherical reference surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is aligned with the wavefront of beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that reflecting aspheres may be accurately measured. The method by which system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is aligned for accurately measuring refracting optics using a &ldquo;master&rdquo; optic has been previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Other variations of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art based on its teachings. For example, it will be evident that the reference aspheric surfaces may be simulated at least in part by their holographic equivalent. Therefore, it is intended that all such variations be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
