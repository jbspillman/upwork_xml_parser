<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION: </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the measurement of battery current and more particularly to a system which accurately determines the current of the battery from a frequency signal generated in response to the battery current. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">STATUS OF THE PRIOR ART: </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In order to fully charge a battery, the current of the battery must be monitored precisely to determine the rate of charge to be applied to the battery. Specifically, in a pack batteries, the charging rates for each of the batteries may be different due to the physical differences between the batteries. One of the batteries may be fully charged, while another one may be only partially charged eventhough both batteries were given the same amount of charging current and charging time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to fully charge all of the batteries, there is provided an equalization mode at the end of the charging cycle. The equalization mode typically begins when the batteries are about 95% charged. The current to the batteries is reduced during the equalization mode in order to provide a slow charge which tops off the charge of the batteries. The current provided to the batteries during the equalization mode may be from about 0.5 amps to 2.0 amps. It is critical that the current be monitored accurately during the equalization mode in order to equalize the charge of all batteries in the battery pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, a Hall sensor has been used to monitor the current provided to the batteries during the equalization mode. The Hall sensor may be error compensated to read the current flowing to the battery at a prescribed value (i.e., around 1 amp). However, often during the equalization mode, the current provided to the batteries may differ from the prescribed value depending upon how much the battery must be charged. As previously mentioned, the current may vary anywhere from about 0.5 to 2.0 amps during the equalization mode which is out of the error compensation range for the Hall sensor. Accordingly, the prior art current measurement systems could not accurately determine the current of the battery over a wide range. As will be recognized, the current through the battery may vary as much as &plusmn;350A for high power applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the need for vehicles to become more environmentally friendly, automakers are creating hybrid, mini-hybrid, fuel cell and pure electric vehicles which utilize a battery as an energy storage device. In the fuel cell and pure electric vehicle, the battery powers electric motors which propel the car. The batteries are charged either through regenerative braking and/or an outside source of electrical power such as the fuel cell. Hybrid and mini-hybrid vehicles do not use an outside source of power to charge the batteries. In hybrid vehicles, a small engine is used to charge the batteries and propel the vehicle. Electric motors are also used to propel the hybrid vehicle. As such, the battery pack is relatively large and provides around 300 volts. Mini-hybrid vehicles use a small battery pack having about 42 volts that is used to power an integrated starter generator of the conventional engine. In both hybrid and mini-hybrid vehicles, the battery is charged via the engine and regenerative braking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized that it is imperative to fully monitor the current during the charging of the batteries of the pure electric, fuel cell hybrid and mini-hybrid vehicles. In order to improve the life expectancy of the batteries, and decrease service and replacement thereof, the current of each of the batteries should be closely monitored in order to avoid overcharging and/or undercharging. Having a fully charged battery pack wherein all of the batteries are charged at an equal capacity will increase the efficiency of the electric vehicle and the life of the battery pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the above-mentioned deficiencies in the prior art current measurement systems by providing a system and method which accurately measures the current of each of the batteries of a battery pack. More specifically, the present invention provides a system which is capable of providing a highly accurate measurement of the battery current during the equalization process. The system of the present invention is operative to provide an accurate current measurement for a wide-range of battery current. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a current measurement system for measuring the current flowing through a battery. The system includes a shunt resistor in electrical communication with the battery and operative to generate a shunt voltage in response to the current flowing through the battery. The system further includes a voltage to frequency converter in electrical communication with the shunt resistor. The voltage to frequency converter is operative to generate a frequency signal from the shunt voltage. A processor is in electrical communication with the voltage to frequency converter. The processor is operative to determine the current flowing through the battery in response to the frequency signal generated by the voltage to frequency converter such that an accurate measurement of battery current can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The processor may be programmed with at least one value of the frequency signal and an associated value of the current flowing through the battery. In the preferred embodiment, the processor is programmed with multiple values for the frequency signal and associated multiple values of the current flowing through the battery. In this regard, the processor may be programmed to linearly interpolate the value of the current flowing through the battery from the multiple values of the frequency signal and associated current values. In the preferred embodiment, the processor is programmed with eleven data points corresponding to the current flowing through the battery and eleven values of frequency associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of measuring the current flowing through a battery. The method begins by generating a voltage in response to the current flowing through the battery with a shunt resistor. Next, the voltage is converted into a frequency signal with a voltage to frequency converter. A processor will then determine the current flowing through the battery from the frequency signal and a table associating a value of the frequency signal with a value of the current flowing through the battery. In this regard, the processor will determine the current flowing through the battery by finding the current value associated with the value of the frequency signal from the voltage to frequency converter. The processor can also linearly interpolate the value of the current flowing through the battery from the value of frequency and the associated current flows stored in the table. Accordingly, the processor is operative to make an accurate determination of the battery current. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawing wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the present invention only, and not for purposes of limiting the same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a current measuring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for measuring the current of a battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a member of a battery pack wherein multiple batteries <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected together either serially or in parallel to provide a source of electrical power to a device. As such, the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be connected to a discharging device through conventional techniques. Additionally, the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be connected to a charger (not shown for clarity) which supplies a source of current in order to charge the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be configured for use in a battery pack for an electric or fuel cell vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The current measuring system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a shunt resistor (R<highlight><subscript>S</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which diverts some of the current flowing thru the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a prescribed known value, such that by determining the voltage across the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it is possible to calculate the current flowing therethrough and the current flowing through the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a shunt voltage V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>is generated across the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected across the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> detects the shunt voltage V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>and converts the same into a frequency signal. The converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is operative to generate a frequency signal that corresponds to the voltage of the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this respect, for every voltage of the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there is a corresponding frequency signal generated by the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a microcontroller or microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The output of the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fed into the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is operative to detect the frequency of the signal from the converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> determines the current flowing through the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the frequency signal generated by the converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may contain a lookup table in memory which associates the frequency signal of the converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the current flowing through the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lookup table is determined by calibrating and storing the frequency for eleven set current points. The eleven set current points are at: &minus;350 A, &minus;35 A, &minus;3.5 A, &minus;350 mA, &minus;35 mA, 0 A, 35 mA, 350 mA, 3.5 A, 35 A and 350 A. During the calibration and storing procedure, the current of the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is maintained at the set current point, and the corresponding frequency signal from the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is measured. The frequency signal for the set current point is then stored in the lookup table. The measurement error percentage is already incorporated during the calibration procedure thereby resulting in an accurate measurement. In order to determine a current measurement between the set current points, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is operative to linearly interpolate the current from the lookup table in order to accurately estimate the current. With this procedure, it is possible to achieve accuracy to within 20 mA. As will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, the lookup table may be stored in memory external to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the preferred mode of operation, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constantly measures the current through the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the voltage of the shunt resistor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is converted by the converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the frequency signal. The processor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> detects the frequency signal and determines the current of the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by comparing the frequency of the signal with the values stored in memory. The processor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will linearly interpolate the value of the current based upon the eleven values stored in memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized that the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can convert the frequency signal from the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into digital values for ease of computation. In this respect, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may contain an analog to digital converter for the conversion process. This will allow the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to easily compute important values such as Watt-hours and Amp-hours from the digital value of the current. Additionally, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be programmed to perform all computations from the frequency signal generated by the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In either instance, it also possible for the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to include an analog-to-digital converter (external to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) which converts the analog frequency signal to a digital value prior to sending the signal to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the voltage to frequency converter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may output a digital frequency value that may be fed directly to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be operative to send the current measurement and any other corresponding data derived therefrom to a battery care unit (not shown) in order to control the charging and discharging of the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized that the current measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used for the measurement of the battery current during all aspects of the charging and discharging process. Due to the shunt voltage V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>being converted to a frequency signal, the measurement of current is accurate for all ranges. Accordingly, at low current measurements (i.e., around 1 amp) which are generated during the equalization mode, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can accurately determine the current flowing through the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In fact, as previously mentioned, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can measure current with a resolution of about 20 mA at all levels of current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art such as having more than eleven set current points. Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only a certain embodiment of the present invention, and is not intended to serve as limitations of alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
