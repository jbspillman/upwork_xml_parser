<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to techniques and systems for controlling the temperature of fluids. More particularly, this invention relates to devices for controlling the temperature of fluids used with internal combustion engines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thermal control of engine lubricating oil and other fluid temperatures can provide significant advantages. For example, it is generally helpful to preheat engine oil prior to startup to reduce engine wear during this period. Preheated engine oil can also reduce high emission levels that are generally produced at startup due to low initial engine operating temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, under steady state conditions, it is desirable to limit lubricating oil temperatures as resulting lower peak engine temperatures are known to enhance the longevity of the oil and the various engine components. Lower peak oil temperature permits oil to perform its lubricating function more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Automotive engines are now generally required-to run hotter than in the past in order to meet the goals of improved fuel economy and lower emissions. With the incorporation of an oil cooler, oil temperatures can be reduced. This permits the lubricating oil and resulting engine operating temperature to be run at a lower, more optimal temperature level. In some cases for certain large vehicles, such as class 7-8 trucks, part of the water cooling system is used for oil cooling. However, these cooling systems can add significant weight, cost, and complexity to the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Particularly for larger vehicles such as trucks, it is advantageous to maintain a lower, more consistent oil temperature because this allows the oil to better carry soot to the oil filter. Achieving improved oil stability permits the use of lighter weight oils, which are known to generally result in improved fuel economy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when higher levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are introduced back into the engine for further combustion in order to reduce harmful emissions and increase gas mileage, the resulting oil temperature is estimated to increase approximately 20&deg; F. EGR is also known to introduce more soot into oil, thus decreasing oil life by exacerbating oil breakdown. Oil breakdown allows soot to aggregate, producing larger particles which can lead to oil filtration problems. Thus, improved thermal management systems are needed for engine fluids, such as engine oil. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides carbon foam based thermal regulators, systems and methods thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the thermal regulator is adapted to provide both heating and heat exchanging.

The heating can be initiated when the fluid is at a temperature below a first predetermined temperature, and terminate when the fluid is at a temperature above a predetermined maximum temperature. The method can also include the step of cooling the fluid after the fluid reaches a predetermined cooling temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The fluid can include other states of matter associated therewith, such as particulates and semi-solid matter, such as states that can be present during injection molding or the pulling of fibers. The method can also include the step of controlling the viscosity of fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A temperature regulation system includes a temperature regulator including at least one electrically conductive carbon foam element, the electrically conductive foam element for electrically heating fluids, and a structure for applying a potential difference across the electrically conductive carbon foam element.

The cooling comprises radiating heat through a thermally conductive carbon foam element. The heating can be terminated when the fluid heating step results in the temperature being above a predetermined shutoff temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The thermally conductive carbon foam element can be graphite foam and can extend into the engine block. The graphite foam can provide a thermal conductivity of at least 50 W/m&middot;K. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferred heat exchange materials provide high thermal conductivity and high thermal diffusivity. Improved materials for this purpose have recently been discovered. For example, carbon foam materials have been shown to provide superior thermal transfer properties. Applicants and/or the assignee of the invention (or its predecessors in interest) have invented (or co-invented) processes for forming low density, high thermal conductivity carbon foam materials; e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,506 to Klett, U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,032 to Klett and Burchell; which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,506 to Klett, carbon foam may be formed from a pitch powder, pitch granules or pitch pellets. The foam is preferably prepared using a mesophase pitch material. The resulting carbon foam is machinable into a variety of shapes from carbon foam elements having standard shapes. Alternatively, carbon foam elements can be formed in molds having desired final shapes, thus avoiding the need to machine the carbon foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Pitch materials can be solvated if desired. A proper mold release agent or film can be applied to the sides of the mold to improve removal of the part. For example, boron nitride spray or a dry graphite lubricant may be used as a mold release agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The sample can then be placed in a volume evacuated to less than approximately 1 torr and then heated to a temperature of approximately 120&deg; C. and held overnight. The vacuum is released to an inert gas blanket. A pressure of up to 1500 psi is then applied. The temperature of the system is then raised to 600&deg; C., or a temperature sufficient to coke the pitch being from approximately 500&deg; C. to 1000&deg; C. This heating/pressurizing step is performed using a temperature ramp rate of generally no greater than approximately 5&deg; C./min and preferably at about 0.5-2&deg; C./min. The temperature is held at the high temperature set point (e.g. 600&deg; C.) for at least 15 minutes to achieve an assured soak. The furnace power is then turned off and cooled to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the foam is cooled at a rate of approximately 1.5&deg; C./min with release of pressure at a rate of approximately 2 psi/min. During the cooling cycle, pressure is released gradually to atmospheric conditions. The foam can then be heat treated to approximately 1050&deg; C. (carbonized) under an inert gas blanket and then preferably heat treated to at least approximately 2500&deg; C. to 2800&deg; C. in argon or other non-oxidizing ambient to graphitize the carbon foam. Graphitized foam is characterized by a highly aligned graphitic crystal structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because of its highly graphitic foam structure, graphite foam provides high thermal conductivity in addition to the high degree of open porosity characteristic of carbon foam in general. As used herein, the term &ldquo;thermally conductive&rdquo; refers to materials which provide a thermal conductivity of at least 10 W/m&middot;K, and preferably at least 20 W/m&middot;K. Thermally conductive materials may be contrasted with thermally insulating materials, which are defined herein as having a thermal conductivity of no greater than about 2 W/m&middot;K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Whether carbon foam or graphite foam is formed, the foam structure is generally characterized as being open cellular, meaning that the porosity is not closed. Porosity tests have indicated that the pore sizes are generally in the range of approximately 50-300 &mgr;m. The open porosity yields a relatively large specific surface area (&gt;20 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g), which improves heat transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The structure of graphite foam which can be produced from the above described method can be analyzed and characterized using techniques such as photomicrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray analysis and mercury porisimetry. Interference patterns under cross-polarized light can be used to demonstrate that the struts of the carbon foam formed are almost completely graphitic. That is, substantially all of the pitch is converted to graphite, the graphite crystals being aligned along the axis of the struts. These struts are also similar in size and are interconnected throughout the foam. This indicates that the foam also provides high stiffness and good strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Typical material properties of graphite foam derived from mesophase pitch are shown below:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown above, graphite foam formed from mesophase pitch can provide thermal conductivities as high as about 200 W/m&middot;K, while having densities of only approximately 0.55 g/cc. Several samples have demonstrated thermal conductivities in excess of 200 W/m&middot;K. Thus, due to the low graphitic foam density, the specific thermal conductivity of graphitic foam is over 5 times that of copper and over 4 times that of aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although mesophase pitch starting material is generally preferred to practice the invention, the invention can use any suitable pitch material, such as isotropic pitch. The pitch can be synthetic, petroleum, coal-tar based, or a blend thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The high thermal conductivity and high degree of open porosity provided by graphite foam allows this material to function as an extremely efficient and lightweight porous thermal transfer media. Although carbon foam which has not been graphitized can also provide a high degree of open porosity, the lack of graphitic structure generally limits its thermal conductivity. Thus, for temperature regulation applications requiring heat exchange, such as for reducing fluid temperature, graphite foam is preferred over non-graphitized carbon foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The inventors have found that both carbon foam and graphite foam are non-electrically insulating materials, both providing high electrical resistivity. The range of the room temperature electrical resistivity for currently available carbon foam is from about 5.5 to 120 &mgr;ohm&middot;meter. The average in the z direction is about 6 &mgr;ohm&middot;meter, while the average in the x and y directions is approximately 85-90 &mgr;ohm&middot;meter for the foam. However, the electrical resistivity of non-commercially available (e.g. laboratory prepared) carbon foam is not limited to this range, since processing parameters can be adjusted to affect a wider electrical resistivity range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> High electrical resistivity permits the use of both carbon and graphite foam as heating elements. Thus, when a given application only requires heating, either carbon foam or graphite foam can be used effectively, while in applications requiring both heating and heat exchanging, graphite foam is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Carbon foam elements can be used to thermally manage fluids. For example, such fluids can include engine oil and other engine fluids, including either liquids or gases. The phrase &ldquo;other engine fluids,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to fluids including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, brake fluid, transmission fluid and power steering fluid. In one embodiment of the invention, a carbon foam element is inserted in an engine oil cooler element, both of which can be provided in any desired size and shape. Since heat transfer is known to be effected by geometry, certain non-uniform carbon foam shapes can be used to improve heat transfer dynamics, such as thermal pumping power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The invention can be used with any internal combustion engine to heat the engine or the oil when the engine is cold, such as at startup. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the foam element also performs a heat exchange function by dissipating heat when the engine is hot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although carbon foam is used as a resistive element for heating fluids in the preferred embodiment of the invention, additional or alternative heat sources can also be provided to heat the carbon foam. For example, heat can be supplied by any suitable device, such as a thermoelectric or thermoionic device, which each can be powered by a battery. Thermoionic heating and refrigeration is described by G. D. Manhan and L. M. Woods, &ldquo;Multilayer Thermionic Refrigeration,&rdquo; in Physical Review Letters, Vol. 80, Number 18 4016-4019 (The American Physical Society 1998) and is incorporated herein by reference. Thermoelectric and thermoionic devices can also provide fluid cooling through simply reversing the polarity of the applied bias voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At startup, pre-heating of oil or other fluids to a desired temperature permits emission levels and engine wear to be significantly reduced. Oil temperature may also be regulated during steady-state operation via passive use of the graphite foam as a heat exchanger. As used herein, passive means without the assistance of a forced fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The foam elements can be easily retrofitted into existing equipment, such as oil coolers, or can be used as stand alone units inserted into one or more fluid paths. Foam elements can be disposable, such as during an oil change, or designed to provide more long term service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Due to its high electrical resistivity, when a carbon foam element is submersed in a solution, the solution may be resistively heated via an electrical circuit which dissipates heat across the carbon foam element. The heated carbon foam efficiently transfers heat into the solution in part, due to its high porosity. Upon attainment of a predetermined engine temperature, such as after an appropriate warm-up period after start-up, the oil heating process can be terminated. Any suitable temperature sensor, preferably interfaced with a feedback and control system can be used for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The submersed carbon foam element can also preferably be used to cool the engine oil once the engine has reached a steady state temperature, or some maximum predetermined temperature. Portions of the carbon foam element extending beyond the submersed portion, such as outside an oil cooler, can be used to provide active or passive cooling to the fluid. Any suitable active cooling arrangement whereby the carbon foam acts as the thermal transfer medium is possible. The shape of the portion will generally be dependent on the desired functionality. Aerodynamics and heat transfer will generally be factors to be balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> For example, in an active cooling embodiment, a heat exchanger can be embodied as a shell-and-tube design with the shell side filled with the carbon foam. In this configuration, the heat transferred from (or to) the shell side fluid would be through the carbon foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, or in addition, another heat exchange element, such as such a graphite foam element, can be inserted into the engine block and have a portion extending outside the block to provide either active or passive cooling. Cooling permits lower peak engine and steady-state lubricating oil temperatures which are known to enhance the performance and longevity of the oil, the various engine components, and the engine as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one invention embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> thermal regulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include an existing oil cooler can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with one or more carbon or graphite foam &ldquo;finger&rdquo; elements. The foam element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a drop-in design with electrical leads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> penetrating into the cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as through the top of the lid to electrically contact foam element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Upon application of a suitable voltage bias across the foam element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, electrical current induced generates ohmic heating. In one embodiment, the foam element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has contact vias (not shown) to permit insertion of electrical leads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Vias may be formed in the foam element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a suitable mold or any other suitable technique, such as machining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To provide improved electrical contact, an electrically conductive contact material may be applied to regions of the foam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which are used to provide contact to electrical leads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. For example, the foam can be coated by electrically conductive materials using electroplating, electroless plating (e.g. nickel plating), flash coating or other similar processes. Brazing pads, electrically conductive adhesive/paints coatings can also be applied to the foam so that desired elements can be joined directly to the foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The carbon foam may be immersed in oil or other engine fluid coolant <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as ethylene glycol. Oil cooler can <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes inlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An optional filter (not shown) may be integral or disposed apart from the thermal regulator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is possible to design foam elements generally though manipulating foam pore size so that liquids, such as oil, can be forced through the foam element so that both heating and filtration can be performed simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An alternative thermal regulator design <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises an existing oil cooler can <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a flanged carbon or graphite foam element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The foam element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a drop-in design with electrical leads <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> penetrating the lid of the cooler and disposed in the flanged ends of foam element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to provide electrical current and resulting ohmic heating. The foam element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be immersed in oil or other engine fluid <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Oil cooler can <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes inlet <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An optional filter (not shown) may also be integral or disposed apart from this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The above thermal regulators <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may each be disposable. For example, thermal regulators <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be discarded with each oil change or at some other interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, carbon foam can be used to provide direct temperature regulation, providing direct heating or cooling to the engine block. In the case of cooling, carbon foam elements can be inserted into one or more engine block locations for passive direct engine cooling, such as heat spreading. Alternatively, carbon foam elements inserted into the engine can be a component of an active heat exchanger, such as a built-in block heater. In any of these direct cooling embodiments, carbon foam elements can generally be used over an extended period of time, such as the life of the engine. The working fluid for active cooling can be pure or mixed liquids, or pure or mixed gases (e.g. air). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Inserted carbon foam elements in the engine block can be used in conjunction with an oil cooler, such as an oil cooler equipped with a carbon foam element as described above. However, use of carbon foam elements inserted into the engine block can eliminate the need for a separate oil cooler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably, carbon foam elements for direct heating and cooling are placed in known engine hot spots, such as to further reduce wear and increase the life of the engine. Foam elements can be placed to limit the considerable heat build up which is known to occur around edges of the exhaust valves. Foam elements can also be incorporated in devices in between siamese cylinder bores, where there is effectively no cooling. This can reduce cylinder distortion, thus increasing engine life. Carbon foam elements can also be use to cool torque converters and for windage trays, where the foam can help cool the oil as it drips down into the oil pan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As a further example, engines are generally equipped with a cast iron cylinder head covering all cylinders. The holes for the injectors are made in the cast material. This generally leads to poor cooling of the injectors, partly because of the low thermal conductivity of the cast iron, and partly because the wall thickness is typically large. Carbon foam elements placed near the injectors and extending outside the engine block can reduce the operating temperature at these locations, preferably through use of a suitable active cooling system thermally connected to the carbon foam elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Heat spreading applications for the invention extend beyond the engine, such as for cooling the engine block as described above. The invention be used generally as a temperature equalizer, such as a heat spreader for passive temperature control applications such as in medical applications and food processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The invention can be used with a wide range of products. For example, the invention can be used with class 7-8 trucks, off-road heavy equipment, passenger vehicles and large stationary motors, such as those used to power conventional mining equipment. The invention is also useful for transformer oil, compressors for gas lines, refrigeration compressors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The fluid temperature controlled by the carbon foam may contain other states of matter. For example, even with filtration, particulates may accompany most engine coolants. The invention can also be applied to temperature control other states of matter, such as those present during processes such as injection molding, pulling of fibers, or other processes where materials are processed in a semi-solid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A method for controlling the temperature of fluids includes the steps of providing at least one carbon foam element, the foam element thermally connected to a fluid. The foam can provide either active or passive cooling or heating. The carbon foam element can be electrically conductive. In this embodiment, the fluid can be heated by dissipating electrical current across the foam element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In an engine application, the carbon foam can provide both heating and cooling. For example, engine fluids can be heated by dissipating electrical current across the electrically conductive carbon foam element when the engine is at a temperature below a predetermined minimum operating temperature. The foam can also provide cooling of the engine fluid if the engine temperature is at or above a maximum operating temperature. Cooling can comprise passively or actively radiating heat through a thermally conductive carbon foam element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The method can include the step of controlling the viscosity of the fluid. The viscosity of engine coolants are known to be critical to the efficiency and life of the engine. In addition, viscosity control could be used to enhance certain processes, such as extrusion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Tests were conducted on three different types of carbon foam materials, graphitized/oxidized, graphitized/non-oxidized, and non-graphitized/non-oxidized carbon foam. GM Goodwrench&trade; 5/W30 oil, produced by General Motors, Corp. was placed on each of the foam samples to determine if the oil wetted the foam. In each case, the foam was wetted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The samples were then submersed in 250 ml of oil in a 1L beaker. Electrical leads were inserted into the foam. A 3 volt DC bias was applied across the foam resulting in a 10 ampere DC current. Temperatures of the foam and the oil were monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The average temperature of the three (3) carbon foam samples and the oil at the beginning of each test was 22&deg; C. The first oil temperature measurement was taken after approximately 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the average carbon foam temperature was 62&deg; C., and the oil temperature more than doubled to 45&deg; C. At 30 minutes, the average carbon foam temperature was 75&deg; C., and oil temperature rose to 57&deg; C. It is noted that test conditions were not optimized since significant surface thermal conduction likely occurred. Accordingly, an optimized test configuration would have likely yielded improved results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as described in the claims. </paragraph>
