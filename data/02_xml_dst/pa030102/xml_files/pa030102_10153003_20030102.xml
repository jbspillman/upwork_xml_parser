<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention reports a method for efficiently inhibiting angiogenesis and regressing existing blood vessels. More particularly, this invention relates to methods of treating diseases associated with pathogenic angiogenesis and to delivering anti-angiogenic activity in live animals including humans having such diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from previously existing microvessels. The angiogenic process is a natural and regulated process in wound healing, fetal and embryonal development and in the formation of the corpus luteum, endometrium and placenta. These processes are vital to health and growth and are very well regulated by angiogenic promotors and inhibitors. In disease states, however, this regulation can be circumvented and lead to pathogenic angiogenesis. Pathogenic angiogenesis is unwanted angiogenesis and is the target for therapeutic interventions. A number of human diseases are characterized by unwanted angiogenesis. These include cancer, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, the formation of the arthritic panus and in psoriasis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In cancer, for example, angiogenesis plays a critical role in the survival and metastasis of tumors. Tumors secrete angiogenic factors that promote the division and migration of endothelial cells, which begins the angiogenic process. It has become clear that tumors need to be vascularised to grow and metastasize. If a tumor&apos;s blood supply is curtailed, the tumor will not grow beyond 0.4 mm. Tumor cells, absent an adequate blood supply, ultimately become necrotic and/or apoptotic. Thus blood vasculature and especially new blood vessel growth or angiogenesis is an important aspect of tumor biology. Therapies directed against angiogenesis could lead to the abrogation or alleviation of these diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The pathogenesis and blindness associated with ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration is a direct outcome of unwanted angiogenesis. In ocular tissue, angiogenesis is the most common cause of blindness. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is characterized by retinal blood vessel incursion of the vitrous. Age-related macular degeneration is a disease of the macula and is distinguished from the dry form by choroidal blood vessel ingrowth penetrating bruchs membrane. Angiogenic pathology is also associated with retinopathy of prematurity, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma and retrolental fibroplasia. Diseases associated with retinal/choroidal neovascularization include, but are not limited to, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, sickle cell anemia, sarcoid, syphilis, pseudoxanthoma elasticum and Paget&apos;s disease. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Oleuropein, the compound used in the present invention can be readily obtained from plants including but not limited to the olive tree <highlight><italic>Olea europaea </italic></highlight>L. and the privet tree, <highlight><italic>Ligustrum obtusifolium </italic></highlight>(Oleaceae). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Compounds suitable for use in the methods of the present invention can readily be identified using in vitro and in vivo screening assays. Such assays may screen for the ability of a particular compound to inhibit angiogenesis or the vascularization of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. For instance, the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, which is described in more detail below, can be used to screen a given compound for its ability to inhibit vascularization. In the chorioallantoic membrane assay as performed in this invention, fertilized chick embryos are injected with a compound on day 3 or 4. The embryos are then allowed to develop for 4 days post injection upon which the shell is cracked and the chorioallantoic membrane is photographed. Based on the number of blood vessel nodes and ends present in the CAM the complexity of vascularization can be assessed. This assay can be used to assess the anti-angeogenic properties of the compounds in this invention. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the compounds in this invention can be administered alone, in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> C. Uses for the Compounds of the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the present invention relates to the discovery that the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein, or it hydrolysis products are useful for inhibiting angiogenesis and, in turn, for treating diseases associated with unwanted angiogenesis. As such, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting unwanted angiogenesis in a cell, the method comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount, i.e., an anti-angiogenic amount, of a compound of formula I or it preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products or its hydrolysis products. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the vascularization of endothelial cells, the method comprising contacting a cell, tissue or organ containing the endothelial cells with an effective amount of a compound of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products. In a presently preferred embodiment, the cells are in an animal subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of treating diseases associated with undesired and uncontrolled angiogenesis, the method comprising administering to an animal an anti-angiogenic compound of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products in an amount, i.e., a dosage, sufficient to inhibit angiogenesis. The particular dosage of a compound of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products required to inhibit angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases will depend upon the severity of the condition, the route of administration, and related factors that will be decided by the attending physician. Generally, accepted and effective daily doses will be the amount sufficient to effectively inhibit angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The methods of treatment provided by this invention are practiced by administering to an animal in need thereof a dose of a compound of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof) that is effective to inhibit angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases. The term &ldquo;inhibit&rdquo; is used herein to include its generally accepted meaning which includes prophylactically treating a human subject to incurring angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases, and holding in check and/or treating existing angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases. As such, the present invention includes both medical therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment, as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases. Diseases associated with corneal neovascularization that can be treated using the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma and retrolental fibroplasia, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, vitamin A deficiency, contact lens overwear, atopic keratitis, superior limbic keratitis, pterygium keratitis sicca, sjogrens, acne rosacea, phylectenulosis, syphilis, Mycobacteria infections, lipid degeneration, chemical burns, bacterial ulcers, fungal ulcers, Herpes simplex infections, Herpes zoster infections, protozoan infections, Kaposi sarcoma, Mooren ulcer, Terrien&apos;s marginal degeneration, marginal keratolysis, trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, polyarteritis, Wegeners sarcoidosis, Scleritis, Steven&apos;s Johnson disease, periphigoid radial keratotomy, and corneal graph rejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Diseases associated with retinal/choroidal neovascularization that can be treated using the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, sickle cell anemia, sarcoid, syphilis, pseudoxanthoma elasticurn, Pagets disease, vein occlusion, artery occlusion, carotid obstructive disease, chronic uveitis/vitritis, mycobacterial infections, Lyme&apos;s disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, retinopathy of prematurity, Eales disease, Bechets disease, infections causing a retinitis or choroiditis, presumed ocular histoplasmosis, Bests disease, myopia, optic pits, Stargarts disease, pars planitis, chronic retinal detachment, hyperviscosity syndromes, toxoplasmosis, trauma and post-laser complications. Other diseases include, but are not limited to, diseases associated with rubeosis (neovascularization of the angle) and diseases caused by the abnormal proliferation of fibrovascular or fibrous tissue, including all forms of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, whether or not associated with diabetes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Diseases associated with chronic inflammation can also be treated using the methods of the present invention. Diseases with symptoms of chronic inflammation include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn&apos;s disease and ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Unwanted or uncontrolled angiogenesis is an important feature that these chronic inflammatory diseases all have in common. The chronic inflammation depends on continuous formation of capillary sprouts to maintain an influx of inflammatory cells. The influx and presence of the inflammatory cells produce granulomas, maintaining the chronic inflammatory state. Inhibition of angiogenesis using the compositions and methods of the present invention prevents the formation of the granulomas, thereby alleviating the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the methods of the present invention can be used to treat patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn&apos;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn&apos;s disease occurs as a chronic transmural inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the distal ileum and colon, but may also occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and perianal area. Patients with Crohn&apos;s disease generally have chronic diarrhea associated with abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, weight loss and abdominal swelling. Prevention of angiogenesis by the compositions and methods of the present invention inhibits the formation of the sprouts and prevents the formation of granulomas. Ulcerative colitis is also a chronic, nonspecific, inflammatory and ulcerative disease appearing in the colonic mucosa and is characterized by the presence of bloody diarrhea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The inflammatory bowel diseases also affect the skin. Skin lesions are characterized by inflammation and angiogenesis and can occur at many sites other than in the gastrointestinal tract. The compositions and methods of the present invention can also be used to treat these lesions by preventing the angiogenesis, thus reducing the influx of inflammatory cells and the lesion formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Sarcoidosis is another chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized as a multisystem granulomatous disorder. The granulomas of this disease can form anywhere in the body and, thus, the symptoms depend on the site of the granulomas and whether the disease active. The granulomas are created by the angiogenic capillary sprouts providing a constant supply of inflammatory cells. The compounds and method of this invention can be used to treat sarcoidosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention can also be used to treat the chronic inflammatory conditions associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis, a skin disease, is another chronic and recurrent disease that is characterized by papules and plaques of various sizes. Prevention of the formation of the new blood vessels necessary to maintain the characteristic lesions leads to relief from the symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Another disease which can be treated using the methods of the present invention is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by nonspecific inflammation of the peripheral joints. It is thought that the blood vessels in the synovial lining of the joints undergo angiogenesis. In addition to forming new vascular networks, the endothelial cells release factors and reactive oxygen species that lead to pannus growth and cartilage destruction. The factors involved in angiogenesis may actively contribute to, and help maintain, the chronically inflamed state of rheumatoid arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Other diseases that can be treated using the methods of the present invention are hemangiomas, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, solid or blood borne tumors and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The methods of this invention are also effective in inhibiting angiogenesis associated with malignant tumor growth. This includes cancerous tumor growth on cells tissues and organs. The methods of the present invention are useful in treating the growth of a number of tumor cells and for treating a wide variety of cancers. Such tumor cells include, by way of example and not limitation, lung, colon, breast, ovarian, prostate and hepatic tumor cells as well as squamous cell carcinomas. Such cancers include, by way of example and not limitation, carcinomas such as pharynx, colon, rectal, pancreatic, stomach, liver, lung, breast, skin, prostate, ovary, cervical, uterine and bladder cancers; leukemias; lymphomas; gliomas; retinoblastomas; and sarcomas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to methods of administering compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein in combination with active immunotherapy (e.g., tumor vaccination). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in accordance with the above methods, mammalian subjects include, but are not limited to, humans, laboratory animals, domestic pets and farm animals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> D. Pharmaceutical Formulations/Routes of Administration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the methods of the present invention, the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be delivered or administered to a mammal, e.g., a human patient, alone, in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition where the compound is mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s) in a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., at doses effective to depress, suppress or inhibit angiogenesis or result in amelioration of symptoms associated with angiogenic diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products, which are used in the methods of the present invention, can be incorporated into a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration. More particularly, compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, dragees, gels, slurries, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of the compounds can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, intracheal, etc., administration. Moreover, the compound can be administered in a local rather than systemic manner, for example via injection of the compound directly into a solid tumor, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. In addition, the compounds can be administered in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with tumor-specific antibody. Such liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the tumor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In addition, the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be formulated with common excipients, diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes. The compounds can be administered transdermally, and may be formulated as sustained release dosage forms and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be administered alone, in combination with each other, or they can be used in combination with other known compounds (e.g., other anti-cancer drugs or other drugs, such as AZT, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, corticosteroids, vitamins, etc.). For instance, the compound of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be used in conjunctive therapy with other known anti-angiogenic chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, antibiotics, antimetabolites, platinum coordination complexes, etc.). For instance, the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be used in conjunctive therapy with a vinca alkaloid compound, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, etc.; an antibiotic, such as adriamycin (doxorubicin), dactinomycin (actinomycin D), daunorubicin (daunomycin, rubidomycin), bleomycin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and mitomycin (mitomycin C), etc.; an antimetabolite, such as methotrexate, cytarabine (AraC), azauridine, azaribine, fluorodeoxyuridine, deoxycoformycin, mercaptopurine, etc.; or a platinum coordination complex, such as cisplatin (cis-DDP), carboplatin, etc. In addition, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the compounds of the present invention can be used in conjunctive therapy with other known anti-angiogenic chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic compounds. In pharmaceutical dosage forms, the compounds may be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be manufactured in a manner that is known to those of skill in the art, i.e., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For injection, the compounds can be formulated into preparations by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives. Preferably, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks&apos;s solution, Ringer&apos;s solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be infused are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For oral administration, the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be formulated readily by combining with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, emulsions, lipophilic and hydrophilic suspensions, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing the compounds with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas, or from propellant-free, dry-powder inhalers. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulator agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes, polyethylene glycols or other glycerides, all of which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition, targeting of a marker on abnormal tumor vasculature can be employed. The targeting moiety when coupled to a toxic drug or radioisotope will act to concentrate the drug where it is needed. Ligands for tumor-associated vessel markers can also be used. For example, a cell adhesion molecule that binds to a tumor vascular element surface marker can be employed. Liposomes and other drug delivery systems can also be used, especially if their surface contains a ligand to direct the carrier preferentially to the tumor vasculature. Liposomes offer the added advantage of shielding the drug from most normal tissues, thereby reducing the inherent toxicity of many compounds. When coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (i.e., stealth liposomes) to minimize uptake by phagocytes and with a tumor vasculature-specific targeting moiety, liposomes offer longer plasma half-lives, lower non-target tissue toxicity, and increased efficacy over non-targeted drug. Other targeting strategies include, but are not limited to, ADEPT (antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy), GDEPT (gene-directed EPT) and VDEPT (virus-directed EPT). In ADEPT, the targeting of an inactive prodrug to a tumor mass is effected by an antibody against a tumor-associated marker. The enzyme milieu in or about the tumor transforms the prodrug into an active toxic agent that then acts on the tumor tissue. Similarly, differential gene expression or viral targeting at the tumor site is used to activate a prodrug into its active, toxic form in GDEPT and VDEPT, respectively. Other strategies include targeting differentially expressed genes, enzymes or surface markers that appear on tumor-associated vasculature, to effect control of tumor growth. Using the foregoing methods, the compounds of formula I or its preferred embodiment Oleuropein or its hydrolysis products can be targeted to the tumor vasculature to effect control of tumor progression or to other sites of interest (e.g., endothelial cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various types of sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject&apos;s weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Determination of an effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Presently, it is contemplated that therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds utilized in the practice of the present invention can comprise anywhere between approximately 0.030 g to 20.000 g of such compound per kilogram mass of body weight of the subject. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates the anti-angiogenic properties of Oleuropein in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). The endpoint of the CAM assay was a quantitative determination of the number of branch points and ends of blood vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane. Such a quantitation would illustrate the complexity of the blood vasculature in the developing chorioallantoic membrane. The decrease in the complexity of the blood vasculature of the chorioallantoic membrane as a result of the application of Oleuropein indicates its anti-angiogenic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A. Approach </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The CAM in the developing chick embryo is an excellent in vivo system for studying angiogenesis, because there is ongoing new blood vessel growth. The CAM assay involves the monotering of the blood vasculature of the developing chorioallantoic membrane of live chick embryos. Various CAM assay approaches have been developed. These include the culturing of live chick embryos in Petri dishes under special sterile conditions. Another approach has been to cut a window in the shell of fertilized eggs and directly apply the compound to be studied in the window using a filter paper. We used a modified approach to the CAM assay, which includes a less invasive method for introducing the compound Oleuropein. Fertilized chicken eggs where candled on the third day of development. The blood vasculature and the yolk were identified. A small 1 mm hole was made in the shell. A small gauge needle carrying 0.4 ml of Oleuropein diluted in saline/water was injected directly into the yolk sac. The hole was taped and the eggs were returned to the incubator for further development. After 3 days the eggs were removed and cracked in a white dish and the chorioallantoic membrane was photographed. Control eggs were injected with saline/water. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Fresh fertile eggs were incubated for three days in a standard egg incubator. Temperature and humidity were kept constant at 100&deg; F. and 65% respectively. On Day 3, eggs were candeled using a police flash light. Embryo and yolk were identified. The surface of the shell was cleaned with an alcohol swab. The egg shell was pierced with a lancet making a 1 millimeter hole. A needle was used to withdraw 0.5 ml of yolk. A 0.5 ml injection was administered directly into the yolk sack. Previous experiments showed that injection of ink, with same consistency used in our experimental and control injections, diffused into the yolk sac within seconds of injection. Experimental eggs were injected with a 0.1% and 1.0% concentration of Oleuropein. Control eggs were injected with an equivalent amount of water. After injection the hole was covered with a small piece of scotch tape and the eggs were returned to the incubator for further development. On day 3 post injection the eggs were removed from the incubator and candeled. They were cracked gently using a butter knife over a white dish. Embryo and CAM were carefully layed out for observation and photography. The heart beat of the embryo was recorded using a live feed video with a Kodak mds-100 camera attached to a stereo microscope. Embryo morphology was noted and embryos were photographed using a canon camera. The blood vasculature in the CAM was also photographed using the Kodak mds 100 camera mounted on a stereo microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> E. Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows the anti-angiogenic effect of Oleuropein on the chick embryo CAM. The results summerize two different experiments with a total of 17 eggs with 102 fields photographed for the analysis. Oleuropein showed statistically significant inhibitory effects on CAM angiogenesis. A 0.93 &mgr;mol/egg injection of Oleuropein caused the inhibition of blood vessel growth by 73% compared to control. A 9.3 &mgr;mol/egg injection of Oleuropein caused the inhibition of blood vessel growth by 84% compared to control. The results from these two experiments suggest that Oleuropein is a potent angiogenic inhibitor. It is to be understood that the above used concentrations are intended to be illustrative and not restrictive.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> An example of the inhibition of angiogenesis by Oleuropein is clearly illustrated by representative photographs taken of the CAM at the conclusion of the experiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows representative photographs of the CAM of eggs treated with a 9.3 &mgr;mol/egg of Oleuropien. In these CAMs the number of blood vessels is greatly diminished and branching is less complex than in controls, which are displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Not only are the capillary beds obliterated but midsize and even large vessels have broken down or are in the process of breaking down. Even a 0.93 &mgr;mol/egg of Oleuropien potently inhibited CAM vasculature (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) as compared with extensive blood vessel networks in control CAMs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A closer look at the capillary bed, where most gas exchange takes place near the edge of the CAM, illustrates a disappearance of the extensive capillary networks in the Oleuropein treated eggs as compared with control eggs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Also observed in the CAM assay as a result of Oleuropein treatment was the shrinkage of the CAM and embryo (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The CAM assay has been traditionally used to assess the anti-angiogenic property of various compounds. These compounds have been customarily applied to a small window opened at the surface of egg and did not effect the CAM or embryo as a whole. In this example we have used a modification of the CAM assay to assess the effect of Oleuropein on the whole CAM and subsequently on the size of the embryo. In animal development the embryo is undergoing rapid cell divisions as well as cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. An anology could be drawn between the rapid cell division and growth in the developing chick embryo with the rapid cell division and growth of tumor cells. Growth in both examples depends on blood supply. The chick embryo needs a highly vascularized CAM to sustain cell division and growth. In much the same way, a tumor needs to become highly vascularized to sustain cell division and growth. Limiting the blood supply will shrink the embryo and by inference the same could be said of tumors. In this modified CAM assay Oleuropein significantly diminished blood vessel growth and a subsequent shrinkage of the embryo was observed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The illustrative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> indicates that there was a direct correlation between CAM size and embryo size. The Oleuropein treated CAM was about 50% smaller in diameter than the control CAM. The Oleuropein treated embryos were correspondingly smaller by about 60% the size of the untreated control embryos. The higher dose of Oleuropein although dramatically effecting both CAM size and embryo size did not effect embryo viability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates the anti-angiogenic properties of Oleuropein in the adult mouse ear model. The endpoint of the adult mouse ear model assay was a direct visualization of the number of branch points and ends of blood vessels. Such visualization would illustrate the complexity of the blood vasculature in the adult mouse ear. The decrease in the complexity of the induced blood vasculature of the adult mouse ear as a result of the application of Oleuropein would indicate its anti-angiogenic properties. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the previous model (the CAM in the developing chick embryo), although an excellent in vivo system for studying angiogenesis, because there is ongoing new blood vessel growth in the growing embryo, we tested another model in assessing whether Oleuropein can inhibit induced blood vessel growth in an adult mammal. The model we chose to use was the adult mouse ear. The mouse ear is vascularized and is thin enough to be directly visualized by a light microscope. If a stimulus is applied to the adult mouse ear existing blood vessels are capable of sprouting new ones (angiogenesis). Using this model anti-angiogenic compounds can be tested for their effects. We applied a sodium hydroxide bum, which stimulated the existing blood vessels in the adult mouse ear to sprout new blood vessels. Prior to the application of the sodium hydroxide bum the experimental mice were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate buffered saline containing Oleuropein. Control mice were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate buffered saline alone. The sodium hydroxide burn was applied to the ears of both groups. A third group of mice were not injected and not burned. This third group of mice shows the status of the uninduced blood vessels in the adult mouse ear. The adult mouse ear assay involved the monitoring of the blood vasculature of the ear in the adult mouse three days after the application of the sodium hydroxide burn. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Mice were used when they were fully grown at 2-3 months. Experimental mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.25 ml of phosphate buffered saline containing 0.025 grams of Oleuropein. Control mice were injected with 0.25 ml phosphate buffered saline alone. The experimental and control groups were injected intraperitoneally once a day for three days prior to the sodium hydroxide burn. On the fourth day a cotton q-tip moistened with a 2% sodium hydroxide solution was applied for a total time of one minute to the ears of both groups of mice. The ears were subsequently washed with copious amounts of water. The mice were returned to the cages for another 3 days, during which time they were given intraperitoneal injections once a day. On the 4<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>day the mice were humanly killed by cervical dislocation. The ears were treated with Nair to remove excess hair and the blood vasculature was photographed using a digital MDS-100 camera attached to a stereomicroscope. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A total of five control (burned) mice, five experimental (burned and Oleuropein treated), and five control (unburned and untreated) mice were used in the experiment above with a total of 30 ears. The results from the above experiment showed that Oleuropein is a potent angiogenic inhibitor. An example of the inhibition of angiogenesis by Oleuropein is clearly illustrated by representative photographs taken of the mouse ears at the conclusion of the experiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a comparison of the ears of all three groups of mice. The ears of mice that have not been burned or treated in any way clearly show some vascularization (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The ears of mice in the control group that have been burned with sodium hydroxide show an increased amount of vascularization, indicating that we were successful in inducing blood vessel growth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). A striking example of induced blood vessel growth can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, where new vessels can be seen sprouting from an existing blood vessel and traveling towards the area of the bum. The potent anti-angiogenic effect of Oleuropein is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. In this figure the ears were treated with sodium hydroxide and the mice also received daily doses of Oleuropein. It can be seen that Oleuropein potently inhibited existing blood vessels from sprouting. The bum area is in fact devoid of blood vessels. This was a consistent result with all the mice that were given daily injections of Oleuropein. </paragraph>
