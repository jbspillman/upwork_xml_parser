<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An optical recording film in the form of a monomolecular layer, includes chemisorptive molecules that are chemically bonded by covalent bonding to a surface of a substrate. The optical recording film has the property that, when irradiated with polarized light, a long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed to a direction in which the polarized light is irradiated. A reflective film may be formed on the substrate surface. For the chemisorptive molecules it is possible to use CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COO&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>&mdash;SiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, for example. The molecules undergo a dehydrochlorination with active hydrogen in the base material surface, and are chemically bonded to the base material surface by covalent bonding. Thus, an erasable or a write-once optical recording medium of high density can be provided by chemisorption without necessitating vacuum vapor deposition to form the recording layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an erasable optical recording film with which information can be recorded in an erasable manner by changing the long-axis orientation of chemisorptive molecules constituting this optical recording film. With polarized orientation light, it is possible to record on this optical recording film information indicating that polarized orientation light has been irradiated, or information indicating the place where the polarized orientation light has been irradiated, or the polarization direction of the irradiated polarized light. Moreover, controlling the long-axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules by irradiating the optical recording film systematically with polarized orientation light makes it possible to record information representing characters or graphics or digitized information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When irradiated with polarized orientation light, the chemisorptive molecule group constituting the optical recording film has a characteristic orientation direction, and it seems that this orientation direction depends on the molecular structure of the chemisorptive molecules and the film structure of the optical recording film. In general, this orientation direction defines a certain angle with the propagation direction of the polarization direction of the polarized orientation light within the plane formed by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light. For the chemisorptive molecules used in the present invention, it is also possible to use molecules that are not oriented within the plane formed by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Throughout this specification, &ldquo;light&rdquo; means polarized or unpolarized light. &ldquo;Polarized light&rdquo; means completely linearly polarized light, completely elliptically polarized light with high ellipticity, or partially polarized light with a high degree of polarization (polarization ratio) including completely linearly polarized light or completely elliptically polarized light with high ellipticity. &ldquo;Unpolarized light&rdquo; means completely unpolarized light or partially polarized light with a low polarization ratio including linearly polarized light or elliptically polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Throughout this specification, &ldquo;polarization direction&rdquo; means, in the case of completely linearly polarized light or partially polarized light with a high polarization degree including linearly polarized light with a high polarization degree (also referred to inclusively as &ldquo;linear polarized light), the direction of the line of intersection between the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction (forward direction) of that light and the oscillation plane of the E-vector of the completely linearly polarized light. In the case of elliptically polarized light and partially polarized light including completely elliptically polarized light, &ldquo;polarization direction&rdquo; means the direction of the major elliptical axis (long axis direction) given by the E-vector of the completely elliptically polarized light projected onto the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an erasable optical recording film on which information can be recorded by changing the long axis direction of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film. On this optical recording film, it is possible to record information indicating that polarized orientation light or unpolarized light absorbed by the chemisorptive molecules has been irradiated, or information indicating the place where the polarized orientation light or unpolarized light has been irradiated, or the polarization direction of the irradiated polarized light. Moreover, controlling the long-axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules by irradiating the optical recording film systematically with polarized orientation light or unpolarized light makes it possible to record information representing characters or graphics or digitized information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The optical recording molecules of the present invention are straight-chained linear polymers, so that they have a large dipole moment within the chemisorptive molecules, and information can be recorded and reproduced with high sensitivity. Furthermore, since the spatial spread of the substrate plane of the chemisorptive molecules and the horizontal direction is small, a monomolecular recording film with a high molecule density is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If the chemisorptive molecules constituting the erasable optical recording film include an optically absorbing functional group that absorbs light of a certain wavelength, then the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules can be oriented using light of a wavelength that is absorbed by the optically absorbing functional group. Also, the irradiation energy necessary to change the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules to a random orientation can be reduced. The necessary irradiation energy can be further reduced using light near the absorption peak wavelength in the optical absorption spectrum of the optically absorbing functional group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> If the optically absorbing functional group in the erasable optical recording film is a UV light absorbing functional group that absorbs light of a wavelength in the UV region, then an erasable optical recording film with recording permanency can be provided, in which the writing efficiency is high, and the orientation state is not easily lost even after repeated reproductions. Furthermore, the possibility that UV light is irradiated onto the optical recording medium during indoor use and storage is low, so that convenient handling is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> If the UV light absorbing functional group in the erasable optical recording film is an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl group, then information can be recorded with light of a low energy density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If, in an optical recording film of monomolecular form including a cluster of chemisorptive molecules having the above-described photoreactive functional group, which is chemically bonded to the surface of a substrate, the optical recording film further has the property that, when irradiated with polarized reaction light causing a reaction with the photoreactive functional group, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules changes to a specific direction determined by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized reaction light, and the long axis direction of the chemisorptive molecules is fixed, then a write-once optical recording medium recording information by changing the long axis direction of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film can be achieved. The long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules that are chemically reacted by irradiation with the polarized reaction light is permanent, and cannot be reverted to its original state. Consequently, a write-once optical recording medium with superior recording permanency is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this write-once optical recording film, the photoreactive functional group is a photopolymerizable functional group, and, when irradiated with the polarized reaction light, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film is oriented in the specific direction and the specific direction is fixed by polymerizing or crosslinking the chemisorptive molecules with one another. That is to say, a write-once optical recording film is achieved, in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film can be fixed by irradiation of polarized reaction light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If, in this write-once optical recording film, the photopolymerizable functional group is a UV polymerizable functional group that reacts under light of a wavelength in the UV region, then the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules does not change even when after repeated reproduction, and an erasable optical recording film with high recording permanency can be provided. Furthermore, the possibility that UV light is irradiated onto the optical recording film during indoor use and storage is low, so that convenient handling is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If, in this write-once optical recording film, the UV polymerizable functional group is a chalcone backbone group, a cinnamate backbone group or a diacetylene backbone group, then an optical recording can be carried out using polarized reaction light of low energy density, and a write-once optical recording film allowing optical recordings with high permanency is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> By forming the optical recording film directly on the substrate surface, a low-cost optical recording film can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If the base material for the optical recording film is ceramic, glass or a synthetic resin, then an optical recording film that shows great stability can be provided. Furthermore, it can be handled easily and is thus suitable for many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the substrate is made of a base material and a primer layer coating formed on the substrate, and the optical recording film is formed on a surface of the primer layer coating, then the optical recording film can be formed on any base material, which increases the degree of freedom with which the base material can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> With the above-described method, an erasable optical recording film can be manufactured that records information in an erasable manner using polarized orientation light, and the chemisorptive molecules easily can be chemically bonded to the substrate surface. This film is an erasable optical recording film with high resistance against exfoliation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method the chemisorptive molecules include an optically absorbing functional group that absorbs light of a certain wavelength, then an optical recording medium can be manufactured that allows recording with light of a low energy density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method the optically absorbing functional group is a UV light absorbing functional group that absorbs light of a wavelength in the UV region, then an optical recording film can be manufactured that has a high writing efficiency, a high recording permanency and is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method chemisorptive molecules are used that have an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl group as the UV light absorbing functional group, then an optical recording film can be manufactured that allows recording with light of a low energy density, that has a high recording permanency and that is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the optical recording film can be oriented with polarized orientation light, the optical recording film can be initialized to various states, thus expanding its scope of utility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method the photoreactive functional groups in the chemisorptive molecules are polymerizable functional groups, then an optical recording film can be manufactured in which irradiation with polarized reaction light can orient the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film in a specific direction and fix the orientation by polymerization or crosslinking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method the photopolymerizable functional group is a UV polymerizable functional group that reacts under light of a wavelength in the UV region, then an optical recording film can be manufactured that has a high writing efficiency, a high recording permanency and that is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> If in the above-described method the UV polymerizable functional group is a chalcone backbone group, a cinnamate backbone group or a diacetylene backbone group, then an optical recording film can be manufactured that allows recording with light of a low energy density, that has a high recording permanency and that is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the chemisorptive solution preparation step of the above-described method, there may be 1 to 3 functional groups to be chemically bonded. Si has four bonding sites, so that there may be 1 to 3 functional groups reacting with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material, and 1 to 3 optically absorbing functional groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> However, the functional group X that reacts with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material is generally a halogen atom, an alkoxyl group or an isocyanate group. If the functional group X is an alkoxyl group, then a dealcoholization reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material occurs. If the functional group X is a halogen atom, then a dehydrohalogenation reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material occurs. If the functional group X is an isocyanate group, then a deisocyanation reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material occurs. Such thin films that are covalently bonded by a low molecular elimination reaction to the surface of the base material are also known as chemisorptive films or &ldquo;self-assembling films&rdquo; to the person skilled in the art. In this specification, they are referred to as &ldquo;chemisorptive films.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A non-aqueous organic solvent is used in the chemisorptive solution preparation step of the above-described method. Thus, it is possible to prevent the hydrolysis of the chemisorptive molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the above-described method, it is preferable that, after the recording layer formation step, non-adsorbed chemisorptive molecules are rinsed away by immersion in a non-aqueous organic solvent. Thus, a monomolecular film with an unblemished surface can be formed, diffused reflections at the optical recording film surface can be reduced, and an optical recording film with high writing and reading precision can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the above-described method, it is also possible to introduce or supply functional groups including active hydrogen to the substrate surface before the recording layer formation step. Thus, if there is no or insufficient active hydrogen at the surface of the base material, then an optical recording film easily can be fabricated by first introducing or supplying functional groups including active hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In a pretreatment step of this method, the surface of the substrate can be subjected to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment, an electron beam treatment or a UV light treatment. Thus, it is possible to introduce functional groups including active hydrogen to the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the recording layer formation step of the above-described method, it is possible to use as the substrate a base material with active hydrogen that includes functional groups having active hydrogen at the base material surface, and to form the optical recording film on the surface of this base material with active hydrogen. Thus, the chemisorptive molecules can be chemisorbed to the medium substrate. Moreover, an organic thin film is formed directly on the base material surface, so that the manufacturing process is simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the recording layer formation step of the above-described method, it is also possible to use as the substrate a coated base material in which a coating having functional groups including active hydrogen is provided on any base material, and to form the optical recording film on the coating surface. Thus, the optical recording film can be manufactured regardless of the material of the material quality of the base material, and the degree of freedom with which the base material can be selected is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The optical recording medium of the present invention provides an erasable optical recording medium, with which information can be recorded in an erasable manner by changing the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer formed on the medium substrate. Information indicating that polarized orientation light has been irradiated or information indicating the location where polarized light has been irradiated or the polarization direction of the polarized light can be recorded on the recording layer with polarized orientation light. Moreover, it is possible to record information representing characters or graphics or digitized information, by controlling the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules through regular irradiation of polarized orientation light onto the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In this specification, &ldquo;medium substrate&rdquo; means all lower layers onto which the recording layer is formed, and these lower layers may be of a single-layer structure (e.g. in case only a base material such as a substrate is used), or they may be of a multi-layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The recording medium of the present invention provides an erasable optical recording medium on which digitized information can be recorded. It can be an erasable optical recording medium having a recording layer only at the information recording unit regions on the medium substrate, or an erasable optical recording medium having a recording layer across the entire medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Throughout this specification, &ldquo;information recording unit region&rdquo; means a region in the recording layer that records one information element. Consequently, if the recording layer is formed only in the information recording unit regions, the information recording unit regions can be recognized. Otherwise, for example if the recording layer is formed across the entire surface of the medium substrate and the entire surface is in the same orientation state, the information recording unit regions cannot be recognized, so that the information recording unit regions are virtual regions into which information elements are written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Throughout this specification, &ldquo;information element&rdquo; refers to the structural elements of the information units when the information has been broken down to its minimal units. More specifically, in conventional binary representations, in which the information units are single bits of information expressed by &ldquo;0&rdquo;s and &ldquo;1&rdquo;s, those &ldquo;0&rdquo;s and &ldquo;1&rdquo;s are the information elements. Consequently, any information can be represented by a string of information elements. In accordance with the present invention, not only binary recordings but also recordings of higher base representation are possible. For n-ary recordings, n kinds of different information elements are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The optical recording medium of the present invention also provides a write-once optical recording medium on which information can be recorded in a write-once fashion by changing the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer formed on the medium substrate and fixing it. A chemical reaction caused by irradiation with polarized reaction light fixes the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, so that a write-once optical recording medium with superior recording permanency can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The optical recording medium of the present invention also provides an optical recording medium on which information can be recorded in a write-once fashion by changing the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules forming the recording layer formed on the medium substrate and fixing it. A chemical reaction caused by irradiation with polarized reaction light fixes the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, so that a write-once optical recording medium with superior recording permanency can be attained. Furthermore, due to their property of being oriented by polarized light, the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer can be oriented by irradiation with polarized orientation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is an optically transmissive medium substrate, then the information written into the recording layer can be read out by irradiation with light. In this case, light that has passed through the recording layer and the optically transmissive medium substrate is measured to specify the written information. In the following, this is also referred to as &ldquo;optically transmissive reading method.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> If the optically transmissive coating of the optical recording medium is a silica film or a silicon nitride film, then an optical recording medium provided with an optically transmissive coating with superior transparency can be attained. Thus, it is possible to reduce the changes in the polarized components of polarized light or unpolarized light when passing through the optically transmissive coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is an optically reflective medium substrate, then the information written into the recording layer can be read out by irradiation with light. In this case, light that has passed through the recording layer and then is reflected by the optically reflective medium substrate is measured to specify the written information. In the following, this also is referred to as &ldquo;optically reflective reading method.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> If the optical recording medium includes metallic aluminum as the material for the optical recording film, then an optical recording medium having an optical recording film with high reflectivity is achieved. This makes it possible to read information with precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is provided with an optically transmissive coating as its topmost layer and a recording layer is provided on the surface of this optically transmissive coating, then an optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is highly resistant for example against exfoliation can be attained. Furthermore, if it is formed on the surface of an optically reflective film, then it serves also to prevent oxidation of the optically reflective film, thus improving the permanency of the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> If the substance constituting the optically transmissive coating in the optical recording medium is an inorganic substance, then changes in the polarized components of the polarized light or the unpolarized light passing through the optically transmissive coating can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> If the inorganic substance in the optical recording medium is silica or silicon nitride, then an optical recording medium provided with an optically transmissive coating with superior transparency can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> If the recording layer of the optical recording medium is formed on a front and a rear side of the optically reflective medium substrate, then twice the storage capacity per optical recording medium can be attained, so that an optical recording medium with large capacity can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is a tape-shaped medium substrate or a card-shaped medium substrate, an easy-to-handle optical recording medium can be attained. Furthermore, using conventional technology for the elements besides the recording layer, it is possible to provide an optical recording medium similar to CDs, MOs, FDs or cassette tapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is a disk-shaped medium substrate, and the information recording unit regions of the recording layer are arranged in groups of concentric circles or in a spiral shape on the medium substrate, then an optical recording medium is attained that can be read easily and quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is a tape-shaped or a card-shaped medium substrate, and the information recording unit regions in the recording layer are arranged in parallel linear groups intersecting at a predetermined angle with a longitudinal direction of the medium substrate, then recording at high densities becomes possible. Furthermore, the mechanism for the recording is also simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> If all information recording unit regions of the recording layer in the optical recording medium are initialized to become oriented regions in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is oriented, then an optical recording medium is provided that can be adapted to various applications. Furthermore, the possibility of malfunctioning during the recording or reproducing also can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the details of the present invention along with preferable embodiments of the present invention. Below is a simple outline of the embodiments described thereafter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 explains an erasable optical recording film (&ldquo;erasable&rdquo; films are also called &ldquo;rewritable&rdquo; films) in terms of its manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a cross-section, magnified to the molecular level, of an optical recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to Embodiment 1. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram illustrating an immersion method as an example of a recording film formation step. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows how a substrate in which an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has been formed on a base material <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is immersed in a chemisorptive solution <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> For the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer of the erasable optical recording medium, it is possible to use chemisorptive molecules having the property to be oriented by polarized light such that when irradiated with polarized orientation light, they are oriented in a characteristic direction determined by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light, or chemisorptive molecules that, when irradiated with polarized orientation light, are oriented in a certain direction determined by the polarization direction of the polarized light and its propagation direction, and when irradiated with unpolarized light, are oriented in random directions without specific orientation. Chemisorptive molecules having the property to be oriented by polarized light usually have the property to be oriented in random directions when irradiated with unpolarized light, but it is also possible to use molecules not having that property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the chemisorptive molecules have at one end a functional group forming a chemical bond with active hydrogen, then it is easy to form a recording film in the form of a chemically bonded monomolecular film. Metal base materials, ceramic base materials and glass base materials, which are typically used, have functional groups including active hydrogen at their topmost surface, so that using such base materials, there is no need for a special treatment of the base material. The functional group including active hydrogen at the base material surface can be for example &mdash;OH, &mdash;COOH, &mdash;CHO, &mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or &gt;NH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> For the chemisorptive molecules having a functional group that chemically reacts with active hydrogen as described above, it is possible to use a silane-based surface active agent. For example, it is possible to use a trihalogenosilane surface active agent, a dihalogenosilane surface active agent, a monohalogenosilane surface active agent, a trialkoxysilane surface active agent, a dialkoxysilane surface active agent, a monoalkoxysilane surface active agent, a triisocyanatosilane surface active agent, a diisocyanatosilane surface active agent or a monoisocyanatosilane surface active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the chemisorptive molecules include a functional group that absorbs light, then it is possible to change the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules with little irradiation energy. Thus, the power consumption can be reduced, and the time necessary for recording can be shortened. If light is used for reading out, then the writing efficiency and precision as well as the precision with which recordings are maintained increases the larger the difference between the wavelength of the light used for reading and the wavelength of the light used for writing is, so that UV-light absorbing functional groups (i.e., functional groups that absorb light of wavelengths in the UV region) are preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As such UV-light absorbing functional groups, it is possible to use chemisorptive molecules including an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl group. Here, &ldquo;aryl backbone group&rdquo; means a group of atoms forming the backbone of an aryl molecule. Consequently, it can be a monovalent characteristic group or a divalent characteristic group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The molecular structure of the chemisorptive molecules can be somewhat branched, as long as this does not impede the variability of the long axis of the chemisorptive molecules, but it is preferable that they are linear molecules with as few branched chains as possible. With such chemisorptive molecules, the dipole moment in the molecules is large, and the spatial obstruction caused by neighboring chemisorptive molecules when changing the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is small, thus improving the responsiveness to light as well as the writing sensitivity and precision. Furthermore, in random regions, in which the long axes of the chemisorptive molecules are random, the optical transmissivity is particularly isotropic, whereas in oriented regions, in which the long axes of the chemisorptive molecules are oriented, the optical transmissivity is particularly anisotropic, increasing the reading precision. Furthermore, because the spatial obstruction is small, an optical recording film with a high density of chemisorptive molecules can be formed, which also improves the reading precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The linear molecules are preferably molecules having, excluding the functional group bonding with active hydrogen, a straight-chain carbon backbone (referred to as &ldquo;straight-chain backbone molecules&rdquo; in the following), molecules having a linear backbone in which some of the carbon atoms have been replaced with a group of atoms (referred to as &ldquo;linear backbone molecules&rdquo; in the following) such as a phenyl group (&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;), a carbonyl group (&mdash;CO&mdash;), or an oxycarbonyl group (&mdash;CO&mdash;O&mdash;), or straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules including substitution groups such as halogen atoms, carbon trifluoride (CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;), alkyl or alkylene groups with a carbon number of 1 to 25, or phenyl groups (C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&mdash;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> For the organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation step, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used. Using a non-aqueous organic solvent, a monomolecular optical recording film with a very uniform film thickness can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As a method for bringing the substrate and the chemisorptive solution into contact during the recording film formation step, it is possible to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate or to immerse the substrate in the chemisorptive solution. It is preferable that this step is performed in a dry atmosphere of not more than 30% relative humidity, such as in dry air, dry nitrogen or dry helium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Using a base material having functional groups including active hydrogen makes the manufacturing of the optical recording film easy. In particular, if a metal base material, ceramic base material or glass base material that already has been in contact with air is used, then it will have a sufficient amount of active hydrogen for the formation of the optical recording film at its surface even without subjecting it to a special surface treatment. If a metal base material is used, then the surface oxidizes naturally when it is exposed to air including a water component, and the oxide formed by this natural oxidation further reacts with water molecules, introducing functional groups with active hydrogen, and mainly hydroxyl groups. Also in ceramic base materials and glass base materials, the atoms of the substrate surface react with the water molecules in air, introducing functional groups including active hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In general, base materials with a hydrophilic surface include many hydroxyl groups, and the hydrogen atoms included in these hydroxyl groups are active hydrogen. Consequently, using hydrophilic substrates makes it easy to manufacture the optical recording film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the case of a synthetic resin substrate, functional groups including active hydrogen easily can be introduced for example by subjecting the surface to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment or a UV-light treatment. Consequently, the optical recording film also can be manufactured on a synthetic resin base material into which active hydrogen has been introduced. With a synthetic resin substrate having functional groups including active hydrogen at its surface, the optical recording film can be manufactured without performing the above-noted treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In the case of metal base materials, ceramic base materials and glass base materials that do not have or do not have sufficient active hydrogen at their surface, it is possible to introduce functional groups including active hydrogen by subjecting the surface to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment or a UV-light treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> If the chemisorptive molecules cannot be chemisorbed directly to the surface, or if the surface cannot be easily modified by subjecting it to surface processing, then the surface may be coated with a coating having functional groups including active hydrogen at its surface. Thus, the optical recording film can be formed on any base material, so that the base material can be selected from a broader range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that after the recording film formation step, unreacted chemisorptive molecules remaining on the substrate are rinsed away. Performing such a rinsing step, a monomolecular film with an unblemished surface can be formed, and an optical recording film with high writing precision and reading precision can be formed. Furthermore, for the organic solvent in the rinsing step, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> A write-once optical recording film can be manufactured in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, except that chemisorptive molecules including photoreactive functional groups are used for the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Chemisorptive molecules including photo-polymerizable functional groups can be used for the photoreactive functional groups. If the photoreactive functional groups are photo-polymerizable groups, then a permanent orientation direction can be attained by orienting the chemisorptive molecules in a characteristic orientation by irradiating polarized light for the purpose of reaction, and polymerizing or crosslinking the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film to one another. Here, photopolymerization also includes thermal polymerization caused by optical absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The larger the difference between the wavelength of the reference light for reading and the wavelength of the polarized reaction light is, the higher is the writing precision and the precision with which recordings are maintained, so that functional groups that are reacted by UV light are preferable as photoreactive functional groups. In order to improve the writing efficiency, it is even more preferable to use light of a wavelength near the absorption peak wavelength to cause a reaction of the photoreactive functional groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> For the chemisorptive molecules having functional groups that can be polymerized by light of a wavelength in the UV region, it is possible to use chemisorptive molecules having a chalcone backbone group, a cinnamate backbone group or an acetylene backbone group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In write-once optical recording films, the ability to hold recordings and the permanency with respect to repeated reproduction is given the most weight, so that chemisorptive molecules whose long axis orientation changes upon irradiation with light can be used as the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film, even when their responsiveness to irradiation with light is low. Furthermore, in order to improve the recording speed, it is preferable that the chemisorptive molecules have as few branched chains as possible. Such molecules have a large dipole moment, which improves the responsiveness to light and enhances the anisotropy of the optical transmissivity, thus improving the writing sensitivity and precision as well as the reading precision. Preferably, the chemisorptive molecules are straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules or are straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules having substitution groups, as in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The chemisorptive molecules may be molecules having photoreactive functional groups and, at one end, functional groups that chemically bond with the substrate. If the functional groups that chemically bond with the substrate have at their end a functional group that reacts with active hydrogen, then an optical recording film in the form of a chemically bonded monomolecular film can be formed. It is possible to use a silane-based surface active agent having a photoreactive functional group for these molecules. For the silane-based surface active agent, it is possible to use a chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an alkoxysilane-based surface active agent, or an isocyanate-based surface active agent, as in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> This embodiment illustrates an erasable optical recording medium whose medium substrate surface is provided with the erasable optical recording film of Embodiment 1 as the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> An erasable optical recording medium is manufactured in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, except that an optically reflective medium substrate or an optically transparent medium substrate is used instead of the substrate used in Embodiment 1. If the chemisorptive molecules have at one end a functional group that reacts with active hydrogen, then it is easy to form such a chemically bonded monomolecular recording layer. For such chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to use a silane-based surface active agent, such as a chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an alkoxysilane-based surface active agent, or an isocyanatosilane-based surface active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the chemisorptive molecules include optically absorbing functional groups, and it is even more preferable that they have functional groups absorbing UV light. As such chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to use molecules including an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The chemisorptive molecules may have some branched chains, as long as this does not compromise their ability to be oriented, but it is preferable that they have as few branched chains as possible. It is even more preferable to use straight-chain backbone molecules, linear backbone molecules or straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules having substitution groups, as described in Embodiment 1 As in Embodiment 1, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation step. Furthermore, a rinsing step for rinsing away the unreacted chemisorptive molecules remaining on the medium substrate is carried out after the recording film formation step. A non-aqueous organic solvent is used for the organic solvent in the rinsing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As a method for bringing the medium substrate and the chemisorptive solution into contact during the recording layer formation step, it is possible to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate, or to immerse the substrate in the chemisorptive solution. When forming a recording layer on both sides of the medium substrate, it is preferable to use immersion in the chemisorptive solution. With this method, the recording layer can be formed simultaneously on the front and the rear side of the medium substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As for the shape, it is preferable that the medium substrate is disk-shaped, tape-shaped or card-shaped. For disk-shaped or card-shaped medium substrates, base materials with high rigidity, such as metal, ceramic or glass base materials can be utilized. For tape-shaped medium substrates, base materials with high flexibility, such as synthetic resin base materials can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, depending on whether the method for reading the recorded information is for transmissive medium substrates or reflective medium substrates, medium substrates can be broadly classified into optically transmissive medium substrates and optically reflective medium substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> For optically transmissive medium substrates <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an optically transmissive base material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for example a glass base material, is used, and the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the optically transmissive base material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Alternatively, it is also possible to form an optically transmissive coating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of an optically transmissive substance group on top of the optically transmissive base material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and to form the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the surface of the optically transmissive coating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). If the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed via an optically transmissive coating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in this manner, the substrate can be selected from a broader range. Alternatively, it is also possible to form the recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> only at predetermined locations on the surface of the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, forming information recording unit regions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> A reflective optical recording medium can be manufactured using a medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provided with an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> made of an optically reflective substance group on any base material <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the optically reflective medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and forming the recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the surface of the optically reflective medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). It is preferable that the optically reflective film has a high reflectance, and examples of suitable materials for such an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are materials mainly including metallic aluminum or silver. Furthermore, if a material with high smoothness is used, an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that has uniform film thickness and even surface can be formed. An example of materials with high optical reflectance and smoothness is metallic aluminum including several percent by weight of silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, using an optically reflective base material <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of an optically reflective substance group, it is possible to manufacture an optically reflective optical recording medium provided with a monomolecular recording optical layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided on the surface of the optically reflective base material <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). It is also possible to form the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> only at predetermined locations of the optically reflective medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and form information recording unit regions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or an optically reflective base material <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, with an optically transmissive coating <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed therebetween. With this configuration, an optical recording medium provided with an optically reflective film that is highly resistant against for example exfoliation can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that after the recording layer formation step, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer is initialized to a certain direction by irradiating the optical recording medium with orientation light (polarized orientation light or unpolarized orientation light). The following is an explanation of the initialization of an erasable optical recording medium. First, it will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-C how the entire recording layer can be initialized. Then, it will be explained how at least a partial region of the recording layer including information recording unit regions can be initialized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> After the recording layer formation step, the long axis orientations of the chemisorptive molecules in the recording layer are in a random state (random regions), and no particular initialization is necessary to take this random state as the initial state. However, when oriented information recording unit regions that are oriented in a specified orientation are formed, then there is the possibility of malfunctioning during usage, so that in the case of an optical recording medium having a recording layer that is changed into a random state by irradiation with unpolarized light, it is preferable that the entire recording layer is irradiated with unpolarized light to ensure a random state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> To initialize the entire recording layer to an oriented state, it is possible to perform bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation of the entire surface of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with polarized orientation light, thus orienting the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a predetermined orientation (orienting by polarized light), but it is also possible to orient them into a predetermined orientation by rubbing the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a rubbing roll <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (orienting by rubbing). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram illustrating methods for orientation by (polarized) light. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C are schematic diagrams illustrating a method for orientation by rubbing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a method for rubbing the medium substrate in one direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a method for rubbing the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> shows a method for rubbing the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a uniform rubbing density in a circumferential direction (that is, a direction vertical to the radius). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, it is possible to rub with a uniform rubbing density by appropriately selecting the length of the disk radius r<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the radius r<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the rubbing roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also possible to orient the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by lifting the surface of the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a certain angle, preferably a right angle, with respect to the surface of the organic solvent <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when retrieving the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the organic solvent <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the recording layer formation step, or, if a rinsing step is performed, in the rinsing step (orienting by draining a solution). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating a method for orientation by draining a solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> It is possible to initialize the recording layer (to form orientation regions) with high precision to a uniaxially oriented orientation state by further applying polarized light after orienting by draining a solution and/or by rubbing. It is preferable to initialize the recording layer by orienting with polarized light after orienting by draining a solution. This way of initialization is superior in that there is no possibility of damaging the surface of the substrate medium as by rubbing, and in that can simplify the process. As described above, by using an orientation state in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules has been uniaxially oriented as information elements or structural elements of information elements, it is possible to write and read information with high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Next, it is also possible to initialize to an arbitrary or predetermined orientation state of the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions by irradiating polarized orientation light on each information recording unit region (formation of arbitrary oriented regions or predetermined oriented regions). In the case of an optical recording medium having the property that the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed into random orientations by irradiation with unpolarized light, it is also possible to initialize the information recording unit regions to a random state by irradiating unpolarized orientation light on each information recording unit region (forming random regions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The following explanation is for the case of initializing a disk-shaped optical recording medium, a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a card-shaped optical recording medium in this manner. However, the case of initializing to a random state the information recording unit regions of an optical recording medium having the property that the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed into random orientations by irradiating unpolarized light has been omitted. If need be, &ldquo;polarized orientation light&rdquo; may be replaced by &ldquo;unpolarized orientation light&rdquo; and &ldquo;orientation state&rdquo; by &ldquo;arbitrary orientation state,&rdquo; and &ldquo;predetermined orientation state&rdquo; by &ldquo;random state.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In the case of a disk-shaped recording medium, the information recording unit regions may be arranged in concentric circles as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> or in a spiral shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. In this case, the information recording unit regions can be initialized in a predetermined orientation state by rotating the disk-shaped optical recording medium and shifting polarized orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction in the radial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions into an arbitrary orientation state at once without rotating the disk-shaped optical recording medium by preparing a photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction through the photo-mask onto the recording layer. Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions into an arbitrary orientation state at once by forming a photo-mask on or below a polarizer, irradiating unpolarized orientation light through the polarizer, and irradiating the recording layer with the polarized orientation light of a predetermined pattern that has passed through the polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> are schematic perspective views illustrating a method for partially initializing the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a method for initialization with a polarizer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided with a photo-mask <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of a predetermined pattern, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> shows a method for initialization by successively changing the location irradiated with light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> For the initialization of a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is possible to irradiate orientation light intermittently onto each information recording unit region, or to successively irradiate the orientation light continuously onto the information recording unit regions. In this case it is preferable to rotate the disk-shaped optical recording medium continuously. Furthermore, it is preferable to irradiate the medium substrate with unpolarized orientation light or polarized orientation light from a direction substantially perpendicular to the disk-shaped medium substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C are schematic plan views showing initialization examples for disk-shaped optical recording media. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been partially initialized in a predetermined orientation state. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been completely initialized in an arbitrary orientation state. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been completely initialized in a predetermined orientation state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In the case of a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a card-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable that the information recording unit regions are arranged in groups of parallel lines extending in a longitudinal direction of the optical recording medium, or in groups of parallel lines that intersect at a predetermined angle with the longitudinal direction of the medium. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>E are schematic plan views illustrating examples of tape-shaped optical recording media and how the information recording unit regions can be arranged on the recording layer of the tape-shaped optical recording media. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in one straight line in the longitudinal direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in groups of parallel straight lines forming a right angle with the longitudinal direction (lattice point arrangement). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in groups of parallel straight lines that are tilted at a predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction (uni-axially tilted lattice point arrangement). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</cross-reference> shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in a triangular waveform made of parallel straight lines tilted at a first predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction and parallel straight lines tilted at a second predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</cross-reference> shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in groups of parallel straight lines that are tilted at a predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction (bi-axially tilted lattice point arrangement). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> For these types of initialization, the tape-shaped optical recording medium or card-shaped optical recording medium is transported in a longitudinal direction and the light beam is shifted in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the medium, irradiating polarized orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction onto the information recording unit regions, so that the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions can be initialized to a predetermined orientation state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In these tape-shaped optical recording media or card-shaped optical recording media, the information recording unit regions can be initialized by intermittently irradiating the polarized orientation light onto each of the information recording unit regions, but they also can be initialized by irradiating the polarized orientation light continuously. It is preferable to continuously transport the tape-shaped optical recording medium or card-shaped optical recording medium. Furthermore, it is preferable that, for the initialization, unpolarized light or polarized light is irradiated onto the medium substrate from a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In particular in the case of a card-shaped optical recording medium, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions to a predetermined orientation state by irradiating polarized light with a fixed polarization direction and propagation direction onto all information recording unit regions of the recording layer while moving the irradiation position without transporting the optical recording medium forward. Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions at once into a random state or a predetermined orientation states by preparing a photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and irradiating unpolarized or polarized light through the photo-mask onto the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C are schematic plan views showing initialization examples for tape-shaped and card-shaped optical recording media. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been partially initialized in a predetermined orientation state taking the longitudinal direction as the orientation direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been completely initialized in a predetermined orientation state taking the longitudinal direction as the orientation direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference> shows a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that has been partially initialized in a predetermined orientation state taking a direction other than the longitudinal direction as the orientation direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the response of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer to irradiation with orientation light. Linearly polarized light is most preferable as the polarized orientation light. Elliptically polarized light is also acceptable, but in this case, it is preferable that elliptically polarized light with a large ellipticity is used. It is also possible to use partially polarized light including linearly polarized components or partially polarized light including elliptically polarized components, but this lowers the writing and reading precisions unless partially polarized light is used that has a high polarization ratio (also called &ldquo;polarization degree&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> For the sake of simplicity, the following explanations are for the case that linearly polarized light is irradiated. When polarized orientation light is irradiated, the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer generally are oriented at a predetermined angle with the propagation direction of the polarized light within the plane defined by the polarization direction of the irradiated polarized light and its propagation direction (also referred to as &ldquo;polarization plane&rdquo; in the following), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This predetermined angle is a characteristic angle that depends mainly on the chemisorptive molecules forming the recording layer. However, it seems that it also depends on other factors such as the molecular density of the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The orientation direction can be either of two directions that are symmetric with respect the propagation direction of the polarized light. As will be explained further below, even when molecules oriented in those two directions are mixed, then the two orientation directions cannot be distinguished if the propagation direction is set to a predetermined direction in case that the reference light used for the read-out is unpolarized reference light or if the polarization direction and the propagation direction are set to predetermined directions in case that the reference light used for the read-out is polarized reference light. That is to say, they can be regarded as the same orientation state. By performing uniaxial orientation by rubbing or draining as explained above, it is possible to avoid that the chemisorptive molecules are oriented in two directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, chemisorptive molecules are suitable that are oriented in a specified direction determined by the polarization direction and propagation direction of the polarized orientation light, so that they do not necessarily have to be chemisorptive molecules that are oriented within the polarization plane upon irradiation with polarized orientation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a case in which the medium substrate is irradiated with polarized orientation light from a perpendicular direction (incidence angle of 0&deg;) but as the incidence angle increases, the interaction between adjacent chemisorptive molecules and with the medium substrate increases, and it may occur that the chemisorptive molecules are not oriented within the plane defined by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light or that the above-mentioned two directions are not symmetric with respect to the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> If unpolarized light is used, it does not have to be completely unpolarized, but also may be elliptically polarized light with low ellipticity or partially polarized light with a low polarization ratio. When completely unpolarized light is irradiated, the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules changes unsystematically among positions on the conical surface of a circular cone whose rotation axis coincides with the propagation direction of the completely unpolarized light (that is, in random directions), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Consequently, a random state is achieved in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is distributed randomly. Here, a random state means a state in which the tilt angle of the chemisorptive molecules against the medium substrate is fixed, but their orientation is not specified, or a state in which both the tilt angle and the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules are not specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of how the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer is read out. Polarized reference light and unpolarized reference light are light that does not change the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules when irradiated on them. The wavelength and the intensity of the reference light have to be determined in view of the optical absorption properties of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer. Generally speaking, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer does not change unless a certain energy is absorbed by the chemisorptive molecules. Consequently, if a wavelength is selected for which the absorption efficiency in the optical absorption spectrum is low, the irradiation intensity can be selected from a broader range, which is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The change of the polarized components of the reference light when passing through an oriented recording layer is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference> are schematic diagrams illustrating the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing an orientation state with different tilt angles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing an orientation state with different orientation directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> When the reference light passes through an oriented recording layer, polarized light components oscillating in a direction that is orthogonal to the orientation direction projected into the plane whose normal is the propagation direction of the reference light have the highest transmissivity. As the angle between the polarized light components and the projected orientation direction becomes smaller, the transmissivity of the polarized components oscillating in that angular direction becomes smaller as well, and polarized light components oscillating in that projected orientation direction have the lowest transmissivity. It should be noted, however, that if the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording film have optical rotatory power, such as molecules including asymmetric carbon, the oscillation direction of the polarized light components with the highest transmissivity and the oscillation direction of the polarized light components with the lowest transmissivity are respectively rotated in the same direction by an angle characteristic for the chemisorptive molecules. But in the present invention, this rotation angle (rotatory angle) is small enough to be ignored, because the recording layer is extremely thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> For like projected orientation directions but different angles defined by the projected orientation direction and the orientation direction, the transmissivity is higher the larger this angle is, and lower the smaller this angle is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The erasable optical recording media produced as described above can be used as follows. First, an erasable optical recording medium whose recording layer is in a random state can be used as a photosensitive plate for recording the position and the polarization direction of irradiated polarized light. Similarly, an erasable optical recording medium whose recording layer is in a predetermined orientation state can be used as a photosensitive plate for recording the position of irradiated unpolarized light. The erasable optical recording media can be used repeatedly by reinitializing after each use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Using polarized light for an erasable optical recording medium provided with a recording layer in a random state, or, in the case of an erasable optical recording medium provided with a recording medium in a first predetermined orientation state, using unpolarized light or polarized light that changes the orientation state to a second orientation state that is different from the first orientation state, these optical recording media can be used to record information by rendering characters or graphics on the optical recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> If there are information recording unit regions in the recording layer of the erasable optical recording medium, the optical recording media also can be used to record digital information by writing information elements into one information recording unit region at a time by irradiating light for a predetermined orientation. The recording of digital information is explained in more detail in Embodiment 5 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a write-once optical recording medium whose medium substrate surface is provided with the write-once optical recording film as the recording layer is explained. Instead of using the substrate of Embodiment 1, it is also possible to manufacture a write-once optical recording medium in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, except that an optically reflective medium substrate or an optically transmissive medium substrate is used instead of the substrate of Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In the case of chemisorptive molecules having at one end a functional group reacting with active hydrogen, a recording layer in the form of a chemically bonded monomolecular recording film can be formed easily. For such chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to use a silane-based surface active agent, such as a chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an alkoxysilane-based surface active agent, or an isocyanatosilane-based surface active agent, as in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> As chemisorptive molecules having photoreactive functional groups, it is possible to use molecules having photo-polymerizable functional groups. If the photoreactive functional groups are photo-polymerizable functional groups, the chemisorptive molecules can be oriented in a specified direction by irradiation with polarized reaction light, and the orientation direction can be fixed by polymerizing or crosslinking the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film to one another. Here, &ldquo;photo-polymerizable&rdquo; also includes thermally polymerizable by optical absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The chemisorptive molecules may have some branched chains, as long as this does not compromise the orientation properties, but it is preferable that they have as few branched chains as possible. It is even more preferable to use straight-chain backbone molecules, linear backbone molecules or straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules having substitution groups, as described in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> As in Embodiment 1, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation step. Furthermore, a rinsing step for rinsing away the unreacted chemisorptive molecules remaining on the medium substrate is carried out after the recording film formation step. A non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the organic solvent in the rinsing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> As a method for bringing the substrate and the chemisorptive solution into contact during the recording film formation step, it is possible to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate or to immerse the substrate in the chemisorptive solution. When forming a recording layer on both sides of the medium substrate, it is preferable to use immersion in the chemisorptive solution. With this method, recording layers can be formed simultaneously on the front and the rear side of the medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> As for the shape, it is preferable that the medium substrate is disk-shaped, tape-shaped or card-shaped. For disk-shaped or card-shaped medium substrates, base materials with high rigidity, such as metal, ceramic or glass base materials are suitable. For tape-shaped medium substrates, base materials with high flexibility, such as synthetic resin base materials are suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, depending on whether the method for reading the recorded information is for transmissive medium substrates or reflective medium substrates, medium substrates can be classified broadly into optically transmissive medium substrates and optically reflective medium substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> A transmissive optical recording medium can be fabricated by using an optically transmissive base material, such as glass, for the optically transmissive substrate, and forming the recording layer on the surface of the optically transmissive base material. It is also possible to form a transparent coating made of an optically transmissive substance group on the optically transmissive base material, and to form the recording layer on the surface of this transparent coating. Forming the recording layer via such a transparent coating broadens the range of base materials that can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> A reflective optical recording medium can be fabricated by using an optically reflective medium substrate in which a suitable base material is provided with a reflective film made of an optically reflective material, and forming the recording layer on the surface of this medium substrate. It is preferable that the reflective film has superior optical reflectance, and examples of materials for such a reflective film are materials mainly including metallic aluminum. Furthermore, if a material with high smoothness is used, a reflective film that has uniform film thickness and an even surface can be formed. Using metallic aluminum including several percent by weight of silicon for example, a reflective film with superior optical reflectance and smoothness can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, using an optically reflective base material made of an optically reflective material, it is possible to manufacture a reflective optical recording medium provided with a monomolecular recording layer on the surface of an optically reflective substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to form the recording layer on a reflective film or optically reflective base substrate with a transparent coating made of an optically transmissive material disposed therebetween. With this configuration, an optical recording medium provided with a reflective film that is highly resistant against for example exfoliation can be attained. And if it is a transparent coating having functional groups including active hydrogen at the transparent coating surface or into which such functional groups can be introduced easily, then a monomolecular recording layer can be formed easily even on a reflective film to which the chemisorptive molecules cannot be easily chemisorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> When, after the recording layer formation step, the chemisorptive molecules constituting the information recording unit regions are initialized to a predetermined orientation direction by irradiating the optical recording medium with (polarized light or unpolarized) light, write-once optical recording media of various initialization states can be manufactured. After the recording layer formation step, the chemisorptive molecules in the recording layer are in a random state in which their orientation direction is not specified. It is also possible to use the recording medium without initialization, but if there are regions that are oriented in a certain direction, then this may lead to unexpected malfunctioning during operation, so that in the case of a recording layer that is changed into a random state by irradiation with unpolarized light, it is preferable that the chemisorptive molecules are reliably initialized into a random state in an initialization step. The following is an explanation of the initialization as well as the initialized state of a write-once optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> If all information recording unit regions of the write-once optical recording medium can be set to the same orientation state, then it is possible to initialize the entire recording layer in the initialization step, or to initialize the recording layer partially. The orientation state may be a random state, an arbitrary orientation state with fixed orientation direction, or a predetermined orientation state with fixed orientation direction. If the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer can be oriented optically, then the orientation state also may be an arbitrary orientation state without fixed orientation direction, or a predetermined orientation state without fixed orientation direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the initialization step, it is also possible to subject the surface of the recording layer to a rubbing process to initialize the recording layer to an arbitrary orientation state or a predetermined orientation state. In this case, the reading precision may be lowered due to diffused reflection when the surface of the medium substrate is damaged, so that it is essential to ensure that the surface of the medium substrate is damaged as little as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> To initialize the entire recording layer, it is possible to initialize the entire recording layer into an arbitrary fixed orientation state or a predetermined fixed orientation state by bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation with polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction. A recording layer that can be oriented with polarized light can be initialized to an arbitrary orientation state or a predetermined orientation state by bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation of the entire recording layer with polarized orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction. A recording layer also having the property that it can be changed to a random state by irradiation with unpolarized light can be initialized to a random state by bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation of the entire recording layer with unpolarized orientation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Taking disk-shaped, tape-shaped and card-shaped optical recording media as examples, the following is an explanation of how the recording layer can be partially initialized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the case of a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable to arrange the information recording unit regions in groups of concentric circles or in a spiral shape. In this case, the orientation state of all chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions can be initialized to a random state or a predetermined orientation state or a predetermined fixed orientation state by rotating the disk-shaped optical recording medium and moving unpolarized orientation light or polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction in radial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> To initialize a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is possible to intermittently irradiate unpolarized orientation light, polarized orientation light, or polarized reaction light onto each of the information recording unit regions, or to successively irradiate the information recording unit regions continuously with orientation light. In this case, it is preferable that the disk-shaped optical recording medium is rotated continuously. Furthermore, it is preferable to irradiate the medium substrate with unpolarized orientation light or polarized orientation light from a direction substantially perpendicular to the disk-shaped medium substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions into an arbitrary fixed orientation state at once without rotating the disk-shaped optical recording medium by preparing a photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction through the photo-mask onto the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions into an arbitrary fixed orientation state at once by forming a photo-mask on a polarizer, irradiating unpolarized reaction light through the polarizer, and irradiating the recording layer with the polarized reaction light that has passed through the polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In the case of a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a card-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable that the information recording unit regions are arranged in parallel lines or groups of parallel lines extending in a longitudinal direction of the optical recording medium, or in groups of parallel lines that intersect at a predetermined angle with the longitudinal direction of the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> For these types of initialization, the tape-shaped optical recording medium or card-shaped optical recording medium is transported in longitudinal direction and the polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction is shifted in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the medium, so that the orientation state of all chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions can be initialized to a predetermined orientation state or a predetermined fixed orientation state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In these tape-shaped optical recording media or card-shaped optical recording media, all information recording unit regions can be initialized by intermittently irradiating the polarized orientation light or the polarized reaction light onto each of the information recording unit regions, but it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions with continuously irradiated polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light. It is preferable to continuously rotate the tape-shaped optical recording medium or card-shaped optical recording medium. Furthermore, it is preferable that the polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light is irradiated onto the medium substrate from a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In particular in the case of a card-shaped optical recording medium, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions to a first predetermined orientation state, a first predetermined fixed orientation state, an arbitrary orientation state or an arbitrary fixed orientation state by irradiating polarized light with a fixed polarization direction and propagation direction onto all information recording unit regions of the recording layer while moving the irradiation position without transporting the optical recording medium forward. Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions at once by preparing a photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized light through the photo-mask onto the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 5 illustrates a recording method for recording digital information onto an erasable optical recording medium and a reproduction method for reading digital information recorded on an erasable optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The recording and reproduction methods for the erasable optical recording medium do not depend on the initialization state of the erasable optical recording medium. Consequently, all of the following recording and reproduction methods can be applied for any initialization state, if the recording layer has the property of being oriented by polarized light that changes the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules in a specified direction that is determined by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized orientation light when polarized orientation light that is absorbed by the optically absorbing functional groups is irradiated, and the property that the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed in random directions when irradiated with unpolarized light that is absorbed by the optically absorbing functional groups. However, with recording layers having only the property of being oriented by polarized light, it is not possible to apply recording and reproduction methods using a random state as an information element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> First, the relationship between information elements and the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer of the optical recording medium is explained. The ways to write information elements into the information recording unit regions can be broadly classified into two approaches, depending on whether the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions is changed comprehensively into the same state, or whether the information recording unit regions are divided into two partitioned regions, and the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the partitioned regions is changed such that it is the same within the same partitioned regions and different among different partitioned regions. In the former, the information elements are specified by the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, and in the latter, the information elements are specified by the area ratio of the partitioned regions in the two different orientation states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D are schematic plan views illustrating the relationship between the information elements and the orientation states of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> shows an example of a binary recording, in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the information recording unit regions in the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is taken as the information element. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> shows an example of a binary recording, in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the information recording unit regions in the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is taken as the information element. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> shows an example of a binary recording on a disk-shaped optical recording medium, in which the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the information recording unit regions in the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is taken as the information element. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</cross-reference> shows an example of a ternary recording, in which the area ratio between two kinds of orientations of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the information recording unit regions in the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is taken as the information element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In a recording in which the information element is specified by the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to record information in binary representation using two kinds of information elements, or record the information in a higher base representation using three or more information elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In binary representation, possible sets of two kinds of information elements include a random state and an arbitrary orientation state, a first predetermined orientation state and an arbitrary orientation state other than the first predetermined orientation state, a random state and a predetermined orientation state, and a first predetermined orientation state and a second predetermined orientation state. The latter two are preferable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> For higher base representations, in case of base 2m representations (wherein m is an natural number), the conversion from binary information signals to base 2m information signals becomes easy. In general, even-numbered bit information is used as the information units, so that it is preferable to use a base 2m representation (wherein m is an natural number). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> For the plurality of different predetermined orientation states in the recording, it is preferable that the tilt angle with respect to the medium substrate is constant and only the inclination angle is different, or that the inclination angle with respect to the medium substrate is constant and only the tilt angle is different. The former case can be achieved by irradiating recording light whose propagation direction is held in a predetermined direction with respect to a reference direction of the optical recording medium, but with different polarization directions. In this case, it is preferable that the propagation direction of the polarized recording light is perpendicular to the surface of the optical recording medium. In the latter case, the polarization direction is held in a reference direction of the optical recording medium, and the polarized recording light is irradiated with different propagation directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Considering the ease and the precision with which information can be written or read out, it is preferable that for the plurality of predetermined orientation states with different orientation directions, predetermined orientation states in which the tilt angle with respect to the medium substrate is constant and only the orientation direction is different are taken as information elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In recordings in which the information elements are specified by the area ratio of the partitioned regions with two different orientation states, preferable sets of two kinds of orientation states are sets of a random state and a predetermined orientation state, and sets of a first predetermined orientation state and a second predetermined orientation state. Information recordings with binary representations using a first area ratio and a second area ratio as the information elements, or with higher base representations using three or more area ratios as the information elements are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of a method for reproducing information. This should be a method in which the information elements written into the information recording unit regions can be specified by irradiating reference light, and the reference light can be irradiated one by one on each of the information recording unit regions, or it can be irradiated on a region including a plurality of information recording unit regions. If the reference light is irradiated one by one on each of the information recording unit regions, then it is preferable that the reference light is focused within the information recording unit regions, which improves the reading precision. If the reference light is irradiated on a region including a plurality of information recording unit regions, then the information elements in a plurality of information recording unit regions can be specified simultaneously by specifying the intensity of the reference light that has passed through the various information recording unit regions or the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of that reference light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of information reproduction methods in which reference light is irradiated one by one onto each set of information elements in the recording layer, one by one for each information recording unit region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Firstly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using a random state and an arbitrary orientation state as information elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of the presence of an arbitrary orientation by irradiating unpolarized reference light one by one onto each of the information recording unit regions and measuring the intensity of light that is transmitted through the information recording unit regions to detect the presence of an arbitrary orientation. It is also possible to specify the information elements in terms of the random state by passing the transmitted light through a polarizer and measuring the intensity of the reference light for a plurality of orientations of the transmission axis of the polarizer, and detecting the absence of a dependency of the intensity distribution of the polarized components of the transmitted light from the orientation (indicating a random state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Secondly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using a random state and a predetermined orientation state as information elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of the presence of the predetermined orientation by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The information elements also can be specified with high precision in terms of orientation differences by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that has passed through a polarizer whose transmission axis has been arranged in a predetermined orientation. In this case, it is preferable that the orientation of the transmission axis is set such that changes due to the differences among the information elements become maximal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The information elements also can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light. In this case, if the polarization direction of the reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be specified with high precision in terms of their different orientations, which is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The information elements also can be specified in terms of orientation differences by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that has further passed through a polarizer. In this case, if the polarization direction of the polarized reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be specified with high precision in terms of their different orientations, which is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Thirdly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using two predetermined orientation states as information elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of their different orientations by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light through a polarizer. Here, the method for specifying the information elements may be a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger or smaller than a predetermined first intensity, a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is within a predetermined first intensity range, a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger than a predetermined first intensity or smaller than a predetermined second intensity, or it can be the reliable method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is within a predetermined first intensity range or within a predetermined second intensity range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The information elements also can be specified in terms of orientation differences by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light. If the polarization direction of the reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the two different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be specified with high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The information elements also can be specified in terms of orientation differences by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that has passed through the recording layer and further passed through a polarizer. If the polarization direction of the reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the two different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be specified with extremely high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Fourthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using a predetermined orientation state and an arbitrary orientation state different from the predetermined orientation state as information elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of their different orientations by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light through a polarizer. Here, the method for specifying the information elements may be a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is within a predetermined intensity range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Fifthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using three or more predetermined orientation states of different orientations as information elements, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer for a plurality of different orientations of the transmission axis of a polarizer to detect the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of the transmitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, using polarized reference light with a polarization direction that is not linearly symmetric to any two predetermined orientation states selected from three or more predetermined orientation states corresponding to information elements, the various information elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light. To specify the information elements in this case, it is possible to detect the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is within predetermined intensity ranges corresponding to respective information elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Sixthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using a random state and a plurality of predetermined orientation states of different orientations as information elements, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer for a plurality of different orientations of the transmission axis of a polarizer to detect the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of the transmitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, using polarized reference light with a polarization direction that is not linearly symmetric to any two predetermined orientation states selected from three or more predetermined orientation states corresponding to information elements, the various information elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light. To specify the information elements in this case, it is possible to detect the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules (i.e. predetermined and random orientation), depending on whether the measured intensity is within predetermined intensity ranges corresponding to respective information elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Seventhly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using, as information elements, a plurality of partition states with different area partition ratios between a first partition region of a random state and a second partition region of an arbitrary orientation state in the information recording unit regions, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Eighthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using, as information elements, n partition states (with n being an integer of 2 or greater) with different area partition ratios between a first partition region of a random state and a second partition region of a predetermined orientation state in the information recording unit regions, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer and furthermore passed through a polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that furthermore has been passed through a polarizer whose transmission axis is set to a predetermined direction. In this case, it is preferable that the direction of the transmission axis of the polarizer is set such that the changes due to the difference of the information elements become maximal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light. In this case, it is preferable that the polarization direction of the polarized reference light is identical or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the different predetermined orientation states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that further has been passed through a polarizer. In this case, if the polarization direction of the polarized reference light is identical or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be specified with high precision in terms of the differences between the orientation directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Ninthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded using, as information elements, a plurality of partition states with different area partition ratios between a first partition region of first predetermined orientation state and a second partition region of a second predetermined orientation state in the information recording unit regions, the information elements can be specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer and furthermore passed through a polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of light that has been transmitted through the recording layer. In this case, it is preferable to set the polarization direction of the polarized reference light to be identical or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the two predetermined orientation states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the information elements also can be specified in terms of differences in the orientation direction by irradiating polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of light that has been transmitted through the recording layer and further passed through a polarizer. In this case, it is preferable to set the polarization direction of the polarized reference light to be identical or perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the two predetermined orientation states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> As the method for specifying the information elements in the seventh to ninth methods of reproducing recorded information, it is preferable to specify the information elements by ascertaining whether the intensity is within a predetermined first intensity region, a predetermined second intensity region, . . . or a predetermined n-th intensity region. Furthermore, if two partition states are taken as the information elements, then it is possible to use a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the area partition ratio by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger or smaller than a predetermined intensity, a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the area partition ratio by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is within a predetermined first intensity range, or a method of specifying the information elements by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger than a predetermined first intensity or smaller than a predetermined second intensity lower than the first intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 6 illustrates a recording method for recording digital information onto a write-once optical recording medium and a reproduction method for reading digital information recorded on a write-once optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the erasable optical recording medium of Embodiment 5, the recording methods for a write-once optical recording medium depend on the initialization state of the write-once optical recording medium. Consequently, the recording methods are explained for each of the initialization states of the write-once optical recording medium in Embodiment 4. In this Embodiment 6, different predetermined directions mean different orientation directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> First, as in Embodiment 5, the ways to write information elements can be broadly classified into two approaches, depending on whether the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions is changed comprehensively into the same state, or whether the information recording unit regions are divided into two partitioned regions, and the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules included in the partitioned regions is changed such that it is the same within the same partitioned regions and different among different partitioned regions. In the former, the information elements are specified by the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, and binary representations using two information elements or higher base representations using three or more information elements are possible. In the latter, the information elements are specified by the area ratio of the two partitioned regions in the different orientation states, and binary representations using two partition ratios or higher base representations using three or more partition ratios are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Different from Embodiment 5, at least one kind of information element has to be in a fixed state of orientation. It is not preferable that a state in which the orientation is fixed to the random state is used as an information element. This is because it is very difficult to polymerize the organic molecules constituting the recording layer while maintaining the random state at high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Firstly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to a random state and whose orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then it is preferable to use as the sets of information elements a random state and an arbitrary orientation state or a predetermined orientation state, a random state and a plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states, a first predetermined fixed orientation state and a second predetermined fixed orientation state, or three or more predetermined fixed orientation states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Secondly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to a predetermined orientation state of a first orientation direction and whose orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then it is preferable to use as the sets of information elements a predetermined orientation state that is oriented in the first orientation direction of the initialization state and a predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented and fixed in a second orientation direction different from the first orientation direction, a predetermined orientation state that is oriented in the first orientation direction of the initialization state and a plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states oriented in orientation directions that are different from the first orientation direction as well as mutually different, a second predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a second orientation direction different from the orientation direction of the initialization state and a predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a third orientation direction that is different from the first orientation direction and the second orientation direction, or a plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states oriented in orientation directions that are different from the first orientation direction of the initialization state as well as mutually different, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Thirdly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to an arbitrary orientation state and whose orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then it is preferable to use as the sets of information elements a first predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a first orientation direction and a second predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a second orientation direction different from the first orientation direction, or a plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states oriented in orientation directions that are different from the first orientation direction of the initialization state as well as mutually different, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Fourthly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to first predetermined fixed orientation state in which all information recording unit regions have been oriented and fixed to a first orientation direction, then it is possible to use as the set of information elements the first predetermined fixed orientation state of the initialization state and a random state attained by destroying the film structure of the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Fifthly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to an arbitrary orientation state in which the information recording unit regions have been oriented and fixed to an arbitrary orientation direction, then it is possible to use as the set of information elements the arbitrary orientation state of the initialization state and a random state attained by destroying the film structure of the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of methods for reproducing recorded information. To specify the information elements, it is possible to regard predetermined fixed orientation states and predetermined orientation states with like orientation directions as like information elements. Consequently, it is possible to reproduce recorded information in the same manner as in the reproduction methods described in Embodiment 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 7 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 7 illustrates an information recording/reproducing device for recording and reproducing information on an erasable optical recording medium or a write-once optical recording medium. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of this information recording/reproducing device. The control lines L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to L<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are indicated by broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, depend on the configuration of the information recording/reproducing device, and if only the optical recording medium is driven, then the control line L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the position control driving portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the information storage portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is sufficient. If only the irradiated light is moved, then the control line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the position control driving portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the recording light emission portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the control line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the position control driving portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the reference light emission portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are necessary. However, either L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have to be provided. For an information recording/reproducing device provided with an information element detecting portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having a movable polarizer, or an information recording/reproducing device in which the information element detecting portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> moves in the course of irradiation of reference light, the control line L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the position control driving portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the information element detecting portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is necessary. Signals from the information element detecting portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are sent to the signal input/output portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, if necessary exchanged with an external device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and then entered into a control circuit portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. From there the signals are sent to the position control driving portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the recording light emission portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the reference light emission portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The information recording/reproducing device may incorporate an optical recording medium, or the optical recording medium may be of a removable type, so that it can be inserted and retrieved. Compared to conventional information recording/reproducing devices using magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, flexible disks (FDs), optomagnetic disks and CDs, the main differences are the recording medium, the method for recording information and the method for reproducing information. For the operation method of the information recording/reproducing device according to the present invention, roughly the same technology as for conventional information recording/reproducing devices can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> As recording media, it is possible to use reflective-type reproduction optical recording media or transmissive-type reproduction optical recording media. In case of a reflective-type reproduction optical recording medium, both the recording light and the reference light should be incident from the side of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the recording medium <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. It is possible to guide the recording light and the reference light from the recording light emission portion and the reference light emission portion arranged at suitable positions with an optical system (optical transfer system), but in general, it is preferable that the optical path from the recording light emission portion to the optical recording medium and the optical path from the reference light emission portion to the optical recording medium are straight lines, because changing the propagation direction by reflective plates or the like also may change the polarization direction. It is also preferable that the reference light is perpendicularly incident on the optical recording medium, because this reduces changes in the polarization components of the reference light due to reflections at the optical reflection film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the recording medium. That is to say, it is preferable that the recording light emission portion and the reference light emission portion are arranged above the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the optical recording medium and the recording light and the reference light are emitted perpendicularly onto the optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In this case, light that has passed through the recording layer and has been reflected at the optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be guided to an optical sensor with beam splitters, half mirrors or the like. In order to improve the recording/reproducing precision, it is essential that the orientation of the reflection plane of the beam splitters or half mirrors is optimized in accordance with the recording method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> When using an optical recording medium provided with recording layers on the front and the rear side of the recording medium, then it is preferable that a recording light emission portion and a reference light emission portion for the front side recording layer as well as a recording light emission portion and a reference light emission portion for the rear side recording layer are provided. It is also possible to provide only one set of recording light emission portion and reference light emission portion and to guide the recording light and the reference light to the front and the rear recording layers with an optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In case of a transmissive-type reproduction optical recording medium, it is possible to let the reference light be incident from the recording layer side of the optical recording medium, but it is also possible to let it be incident from the side opposite the recording layer. The same is true for the recording light. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>D are schematic cross-sectional views showing the irradiation directions of recording light and reference light with respect to the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of an optical recording medium provided with an optically transmissive medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>A, the recording light and the reference light are irradiated from the side of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>B, the recording light is irradiated from the side of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the reference light is irradiated from the side of the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>C, the recording light is irradiated from the side of the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the reference light is irradiated from the side of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>D, the recording light and the reference light are irradiated from the side of the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> As in the above-described case of a reflective-type optical recording medium, it is preferable that the optical path from the recording light emission portion to the optical recording medium and the optical path from the reference light emission portion to the optical recording medium are straight lines. It is also preferable that the reference light is perpendicularly incident on the optical recording medium, because this reduces changes in the polarization components of the reference light due to refraction when passing through the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 8 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 8 illustrates a preferable configuration of an information recording/reproducing device for recording and reproducing information on an erasable optical recording medium or a write-once optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> First, recording and reproduction taking the random state and a predetermined orientation state as information elements, and recording and reproduction taking the area ratio between a first partitioned region in the random state and a second partitioned region in a predetermined orientation state as information elements is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> As the recording light emission portion, it is preferable to use a recording means A including two unpolarized recording light sources and a polarizer that is arranged in the optical path of light emitted from one of the unpolarized light sources and that has a transmission axis that is arranged in a predetermined orientation, or to use a recording means B including one unpolarized recording light source, a shiftable polarizer whose transmission axis is arranged in a predetermined orientation and a driving means for selectively shifting the polarizer into or out of the optical path of light emitted from the unpolarized light source (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The following four reproduction means A to D including a reference light emission means and an information element detection means are preferable as reproduction means. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> In the reproduction means C, the reference light emission portion has one unpolarized light source for reference light. The information element detecting portion has an optical sensor and an analyzer that is arranged in the optical path of the light entering the optical sensor and whose transmission axis is set to a predetermined direction. The intensity of the unpolarized reference light from the reference light emission portion that has passed through the recording layer and then through the analyzer is measured by the optical sensor, and a predetermined electrical signal based on the measurement result is output to the signal input/output portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> In the reproduction means D, the reference light emission portion has one unpolarized light source for reference light, and a polarizer that is arranged in the optical path of the light emitted from the unpolarized light source and whose transmission axis is set to a predetermined direction. The information element detecting portion has an optical sensor and an analyzer that is arranged in the optical path of the light entering the sensor and whose transmission axis is set to a predetermined direction.

<heading lvl="1">Working Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> First, a glass substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that has been processed into disk shape was prepared as a base material and rinsed thoroughly. Then, aluminum (Al) including 2% by weight of silicon (Si) was vacuum vapor deposited on the surface of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form an optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was set to about 500 nm. Then, functional groups including active hydrogen resulting from natural oxidation were introduced into the topmost surface of the optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by exposure to a moist air atmosphere, thus producing a substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> whose topmost surface has functional groups including active hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Next, a linear chlorosilane surface active agent A (also referred to as &ldquo;chemisorptive compound&rdquo; in the following) of the formula CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COO&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>&mdash;SiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which has a trichlorosilyl group (&mdash;SiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), which is a functional group chemically bonding with the active hydrogen of the substrate, at one end and includes &mdash;COOC<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, an optically absorbing functional group, was prepared. Then, the chlorosilane surface active agent A was dissolved to a concentration of about 1% by weight in thoroughly dehydrated hexadecane, which is a non-aqueous solvent, thus preparing a chemisorptive solution <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (chemisorptive solution preparation step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was immersed in the chemisorptive solution <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> under a dry atmosphere (of not more than 30% relative humidity) for about one hour (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Thus, the chlorosilane surface active agent A was chemisorbed to the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a monomolecular optical recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, chemically bonded as CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COO&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Si(&mdash;O&mdash;)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, was formed (recording film formation step) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> After that, the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was retrieved from the chemisorptive solution <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, rinsed with thoroughly dehydrated n-hexane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is a non-aqueous organic solvent, to rinse off the unreacted silane-based surface active agent remaining on the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (rinsing step). Then, the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was exposed to air including a water component (moisture) to fabricate the optical recording film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> In this series of steps, the trichlorosilyl group in the chlorosilane-based surface active agent A and hydroxyl groups at the surface of the optically reflective film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (many &mdash;OH groups are created by forming Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at the surface by natural oxidation of Al and further reacting it with water molecules in air), undergo a dechlorination reaction, forming chemical bonds with the surface of the optical recording film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Moreover, when the substrate is exposed to air after the chemisorption, siloxane bonds among the chemisorptive molecules are created by reaction with the water component in the air, so that a recording layer in the form of a monomolecular film including optically absorbing &mdash;COOC<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is formed at the surface of the optical recording film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since hydrocarbon groups (in this case, &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) are hydrophobic, the &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>groups are chemisorbed to the hydrophilic surface such that the molecules of the chlorosilane surface active agent stand obliquely on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Next, the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was rotated, and first polarized orientation light was focused in dots from a substantially perpendicular direction onto the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, making the polarization direction of the polarized orientation light substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate. The &mdash;COOC<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash; groups, which are optically absorbing groups, have the property of absorbing light of a wavelength of 230 to 300 nm, so that polarized light from a super-high pressure mercury lamp of a wavelength of 254 nm was used for the polarized light. The diameter of the focused polarized orientation light on the surface of the recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (referred to as &ldquo;spot diameter&rdquo; in the following) was set to 1.2 &mgr;m, and its intensity was set to 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(initialization step) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> After the irradiation of the polarized orientation light, the surface of the disk-shaped optical recording medium was examined with a microscopic Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (referred to as &ldquo;microscopic FT-IR&rdquo; in the following), and it was found that the dots were lined up in concentric circles, and the chemisorptive molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> included in the dots were arranged substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31B and 31C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, examining the surface with the microscopic FT-IR confirmed that when dots are first irradiated with a first polarized orientation light and then with a second polarized orientation light with the same propagation direction but different polarization direction, the chemisorptive molecules were oriented substantially parallel to the polarization direction of the second polarized orientation light. It was also confirmed that if unpolarized orientation light is irradiated instead of the first polarized orientation light, a random state without specifiable orientation direction results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Irradiating polarized light of a wavelength corresponding to the absorption peak of the chemisorptive molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constituting the recording film, it was possible to align the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> included in the dots to be substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a low energy of about 250 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> Also, an erasable optical recording film could be formed in a similar manner when using a silane-based surface active agent having an alkoxysilyl group or an isocyanate group instead of the trichlorosilyl group. More specifically, erasable optical recording media could be manufactured with chemisorptive molecules of the following chemical formulas: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> Next, the optical recording medium was rotated, and first polarized reaction light, whose polarization direction was substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate, was focused in dots from a substantially perpendicular direction onto the surface of the substrate.

The spot diameter of the focused first polarized reaction light on the surface of the recording layer was set to 1.0 &mgr;m, and its intensity was set to 300 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> After the irradiation of the first polarized reaction light, the surface of the disk-shaped optical recording medium was examined with a microscopic FT-IR, and it was found that the dots were lined up in concentric circles, and the chemisorptive molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> included in the dots were arranged substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Working Example 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> A glass substrate processed into disk-shape was prepared, rinsed thoroughly, and an optically reflective film was formed by vacuum vapor deposition of aluminum (Al) including 2% by weight of silicon (Si) on the surface of the substrate 1.

<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> Using the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> prepared in this manner and the chlorosilane surface active agent A, a monomolecular film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was formed by the same chemisorptive method as in Working Example 1. Thus, a recording layer was reactively formed on the surface of the medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> Then, the optical recording medium was rotated, and first polarized recording light, whose polarization direction was substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate, was focused in dots from a substantially perpendicular direction onto the substrate surface to format the recording layer (initialization step) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference>). The wavelength of the focused first polarized recording light was 254 nm, the spot diameter on the surface of the recording layer was set to 1.2 &mgr;m, and its intensity was set to 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Next, unpolarized recording light with a wavelength of 254 nm, a spot diameter of 1.0 &mgr;m at the recording layer surface and an intensity of 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>was irradiated in dots from the propagation direction of the first polarized recording light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> Then, examining the surface with the microscopic FT-IR showed that the regions in dots irradiated with unpolarized recording light were in a random state, and in the regions in dots not irradiated with unpolarized recording light, the orientation was unchanged, and thus the same as after formatting. Furthermore, irradiating the first polarized recording light again, the dots were in the same orientation as after formatting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, examining the surface with the microscopic FT-IR confirmed that the orientation state of the formatted dots did not change when unpolarized reference light or polarized reference light with a wavelength in the visible spectrum was irradiated on them. Similarly, it also could be confirmed that the orientation state of the formatted dots that subsequently had been irradiated with unpolarized recording light did not change when further unpolarized or polarized reference light was irradiated on them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Irradiating first polarized recording light or first unpolarized recording light with a spot diameter of 0.8 &mgr;m onto an erasable optical recording medium of 5.25 inch diameter fabricated as described above, it was possible to record 5 gigabytes of information. Furthermore, when the recording layer was provided on both sides, 10 gigabytes of information could be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> This Working Example 3 has been explained for the case that the silane-based surface active agent A is used for the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer, but it was also possible to manufacture a similar erasable optical recording medium using the chemisorptive molecules described in Working Example 1. Furthermore, when chemisorptive molecules were used in which the optically absorbing functional groups have an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl group, the optical sensitivity was increased, which shortened the time necessary for formatting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Working Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> A glass substrate processed into disk-shape was prepared, rinsed thoroughly, and an optically reflective film was formed by vacuum vapor deposition of aluminum (Al) including 2% by weight of silicon (Si) on the surface of the glass substrate. The thickness of the optically reflective film was set to about 200 nm. Using the medium substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fabricated in this manner and the chlorosilane surface active agent B, a monomolecular recording layer was formed reactively on the surface of the medium substrate by the same chemisorptive method as in Working Example 1. Thus, a write-once optical recording medium was fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Then, the optical recording medium was rotated, and first polarized reaction light, whose polarization direction was substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the medium substrate, and which had a wavelength of 365 nm (i-line of a super-high pressure mercury lamp), a spot diameter of 1 &mgr;m, and an intensity of 400 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, was irradiated in dots from a substantially perpendicular direction onto the medium substrate surface to format the recording layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> Then, examining the surface of the write-once optical recording medium with the microscopic FT-IR showed that the dots were aligned in groups of concentric circles, and the chemisorptive molecules in the recording dots were oriented substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the medium substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the orientation direction of the recorded dots did not change when they were irradiated with second polarized reaction recording light having a different polarization direction than the first polarized reaction recording light. Also, when irradiating the dots with destructive unpolarized recording light with an intensity of 4 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, a portion of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer was destroyed, leading to a random state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Irradiating first polarized recording light or first unpolarized recording light with a spot diameter of 0.8 &mgr;m onto a write-once optical recording medium of 5.25 inch diameter fabricated as described above, it was possible to record 5 gigabytes of information.

<heading lvl="1">Working Example 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> An information recording/reproducing device for recording/reproducing a disk-shaped erasable optical recording medium <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having a recording layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prepared as in Working Example 3 was fabricated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the information recording/reproducing device is provided with a recording light emission portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> including a polarizer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, one unpolarized light source <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and a shiftable polarization plate driving device; a reference light emission portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> including one unpolarized light source; an information element detecting portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> including an analyzer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; receiving light from a beam splitter <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and one optical sensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>; a medium driving device <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for rotatively driving the erasable optical recording medium <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; a position control driving circuit portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> including a light emission portion driving device for shifting the recording light emission portion and the reference light emission portion in the radial direction of the optical recording medium; an optical recording medium control circuit portion; and a signal input/output portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> denotes an external device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> In Working Example 5 as well as in Working Examples 5 to 10, dot-shaped focused light is used as the recording light and the reference light, and the dot-shaped regions irradiated with recording light (referred to as &ldquo;recording dots&rdquo; in the following) are taken as information recording unit regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> Here, the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules in the monomolecular recording layer constituting the recording dots was first initialized to a random state. For writing, polarized or unpolarized recording light of 254 nm wavelength and focused to a diameter of about 1.2 &mgr;m was irradiated at 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>onto the recording layer in accordance with a digital signal while rotating the optical recording medium, thus forming recording dots in which the chemisorptive molecules are in a predetermined orientation state (predetermined orientation regions) and in a random state (random regions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> Next, reference light of 530 nm wavelength and focused to a diameter of about 1 &mgr;m was irradiated at 200 mJ/cm2 onto the recording dots, and after passing through the recording layer, the light reflected by the optically reflective film was picked up with the optical sensor to confirm whether the chemisorptive molecules in the recording dots are oriented or not (i.e., whether they are in a random state). That is to say, the information elements were specified by detecting the intensity difference of light reflected by the optically reflective film, which depends on whether the chemisorptive molecules in the dots are in a specific predetermined state or in a random state. The information could be reproduced by performing this specification of information elements sequentially for each of the recording dots. In order to reduce discrepancies in the precision with which the optical irradiation is positioned, and reading errors with the optical sensor, in other words to improve the reading precision, it was very effective to make the spot diameter of the reading light smaller than the spot diameter of the writing light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> As for the deletion of information once it has been recorded, the initialization state could be recreated by irradiating unpolarized recording light onto the recording dots at 500 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to change the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording dots to a random state. Furthermore, writing a second time was possible by irradiating polarized recording light on the recording dots that have been reinitialized. That is to say, it was possible to realize an erasable information recording/reproducing device, the information on which can be deleted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by irradiating polarized or unpolarized recording light on each dot in accordance with a digital signal, it was also possible to rewrite by overwriting without going through the above-described deleting of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> In the recording layer of the erasable optical recording medium used in this Working Example 5, the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer were fixed by covalent bonding with the surface of the medium substrate, so that no exfoliation or damage occurred even after thousands of reading operations. </paragraph>
