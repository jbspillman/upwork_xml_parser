<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to materials having low electromagnetic reflection and refraction. The invention generally concerns materials provided to control electromagnetic reflection and refraction. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The behavior of electromagnetic radiation is altered when it interacts with charged particles. Whether these charged particles are free, as in plasmas, nearly free, as in conducting media, or restricted, as in insulating or semi conducting media&mdash;the interaction between an electromagnetic field and charged particles will result in a change in one or more of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation. Because of this interaction, media and devices can be produced that generate, detect, amplify, transmit, reflect, steer, or otherwise control electromagnetic radiation for specific purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The behavior of electromagnetic radiation interacting with a material can be predicted by knowledge of the material&apos;s electromagnetic materials parameters &egr; and &mgr; where &egr; is the electric permittivity of the medium, and &mgr; is the magnetic permeability of the medium. These parameters represent a macroscopic response averaged over the medium, the actual local response being more complicated to describe and generally not necessary to describe the electromagnetic behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Reflection and transmission at the interface between two media are governed by the index of refraction &eegr; and impedance z of each medium. The index &eegr; and the impedance z are directly related to the reflection and transmission properties of a slab of material, and hence are the observable quantities that correspond directly to the electromagnetic performance of materials. The index of refraction &eegr; and the impedance z can be expressed in relative terms in relation to corresponding properties for free space as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&eegr;&equals;&lsqb;(&egr;&mgr;)/(&egr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&mgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight>&equals;(&mgr;/&egr;)<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>/(&mgr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>/&egr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> where the subscript <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> indicates free space values associated with a vacuum. Air has very nearly the index of refraction and impedance of vacuum. Thus, the relative index of refraction and the relative electromagnetic impedance z of air are often taken to be equal to unity. Note that the permittivity and permeability can be found from the index and the impedance using the above relations, as &egr;&equals;&eegr;/z and &mgr;&equals;&eegr;z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition to having low material losses, a material that is electromagnetically &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; will have both its index of refraction and impedance numerically close to that of the surrounding medium. Such a material is valuable for many applications. For example, airplanes may have a collision detection radar system mounted near their &ldquo;nose.&rdquo; This system operates inside a composite dome known as a radome that has a shape optimized for aerodynamic properties. The radar system must compensate for the lensing effects of the shaped radome composite material, which typically has a relative index of refraction that is significantly greater than unity. Such compensation requires effort and expense, and is subject to error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By way of additional example, structural materials may be used to embed a sensor such as an array of antennas in a wireless communications device. Reflection and refraction effects in these structural materials are likewise undesirable. In both of these applications, material requirements, irrespective of their electromagnetic reflection and refraction properties, include physical properties such as strength, ductility, and resistance to heat, cold, and moisture. The prior art has had limited success in satisfying these needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Materials and methods for generally minimizing electromagnetic reflection and maximizing transparency have been proposed. For example, materials have been proposed that have a high absorption of incident radiation at microwave and other frequencies. In addition to preventing transmission of radiation, the strong absorbance of these materials often leads to a substantial reflected component. As a result, use of these materials is usually accompanied by irregular material shapes and surface angles required to direct the reflected component in a desired direction. The required irregular surface angles and shapes significantly limit the utility of such materials and methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, the prior art has employed particular naturally occurring media that may be found in nature or that can be formed by known chemical synthesis and that may have a low level of electromagnetic reflection over a particular frequency range. Use of such media is disadvantageously limited to these particular frequency ranges. Also, it is difficult to find media with significant permeability at RF and higher frequencies. These media may also be structurally unsuitable for many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Previous study of the effects of so-called &ldquo;artificial dielectric&rdquo; materials on electromagnetic waves has been performed. For example, artificial dielectric materials based on arrays of substructures that collectively have a desired response to electromagnetic radiation have been studied. These arrays, which need not necessarily be periodic in nature, have in common that the dimensions and spacing of the scattering elements are less than the wavelengths over which the composite material will operate. It is found that by averaging the local electromagnetic fields over such a structure, an effective permittivity (and/or permeability) function can be applied that roughly describes the scattering properties of the composite. The procedure that arrives at this description is known in the literature as &ldquo;effective medium theory.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An example of a prior art artificial dielectric material is the &ldquo;rodded&rdquo; medium, used as an analogue medium to study propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere &lsqb;See, e.g., R. N. Bracewell, &ldquo;Analogues of an Ionized Medium&rdquo;, Wireless Engineer, 31:320-6, December 1954, herein incorporated by reference&rsqb;. An artificial medium based on conducting wires or posts has a dielectric function identical to that describing a dilute, collisionless neutral plasma. Accordingly, as used herein a medium based on conducting wires will be referred to as a &ldquo;plasmonic&rdquo; medium. More recently, artificial plasmonic media have been proposed using, for example, a periodic arrangement of very thin conducting wires. See, e.g., J. B. Pendry et al., &ldquo;Extremely low frequency plasmons in metallic mesostructures&rdquo;, Physical Review Letters, 76(25):4771-6, 1996; see also D. R. Smith et al., &ldquo;Loop-wire for investigating plasmons at microwave frequencies,&rdquo; Applied Physics Letters, 75(10):1425-7, 1999; both of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other recent examples of artificial dielectrics include the use of random arrangements of metal &ldquo;needles&rdquo; suspended in a foam structure as a &ldquo;lens&rdquo; with an index of refraction greater than unity. Many foam-like materials have a refractive index approximately equal to unity. Adding needles serves to increase the index for low-frequency RF radiation as with radio astronomy. These materials, however, are not acceptable for applications requiring a degree of mechanical strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To date, these prior art efforts have not been successful in providing materials that have a low reflectance and good transparency at a desired wavelength in addition to having advantageous structural mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Unresolved needs in the art therefore exist. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a composite material comprising a host dielectric medium having an index of refraction greater than 1, and an artificial plasmon medium embedded in the host medium. The artificial plasmon medium has a dielectric function of less than one so that the permittivity of the composite material is substantially equal to that of the surrounding medium for incident electromagnetic radiation of a desired frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Composite media of the invention thus can be of utility as materials that are highly transparent and exhibit minimal reflectance or refraction for electromagnetic waves in a desired frequency range. Also, composite media embodiments of the present invention can be &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; for achieving transparency and/or minimal reflection and refraction for electromagnetic waves in the desired frequency range through selection of particular conductor/host materials, conductor/host sizing and/or spacing, and conductor/host geometric configuration. Further, composite media of the present invention allow for achieving these desired electromagnetic properties (e.g., transparency and low reflection) while providing advantageous structural and mechanical properties, with the result that embodiments of the present invention will be well suited for applications such as radomes, antennas, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above brief description sets forth broadly some of the features and advantages of the present disclosure so that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION: </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the best known modes of practice of the present invention, it will be useful to first discuss some relevant properties and relationships of physics. The wavelength &lgr;, the frequency f of electromagnetic radiation, and the velocity v are related by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>v&equals;&lgr;f </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The angular frequency &ohgr; is related to the frequency by a constant: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;2&pgr;f </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In dimensionless quantities, then, ratios of frequencies can be used interchangeably: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/f</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&equals;(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the presence of a material, Maxwell&apos;s equations must be solved in the presence of the material. The local electromagnetic response of a material&mdash;the exact electric and magnetic field distributions that occur near the atoms or elements that compose the material&mdash;will in general be very complicated. However, since the exact nature of the local fields in a material is usually unimportant to the behavior of the electromagnetic waves propagating through the material, the local fields are typically averaged to obtain a set of Maxwell&apos;s equations that includes the material properties in two parameters: &egr; and &mgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A simple example of an idealized medium is the Drude medium, which in certain limits describes such systems as conductors and dilute plasmas. The averaging process leads to a permittivity that, as a function frequency, has the form </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&egr;(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>)/&egr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;1<highlight><italic>&minus;f</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/f</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>f&plus;iv</italic></highlight>) &emsp;&emsp;EQTN. A </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> where f is the electromagnetic excitation frequency, f<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>is the plasma frequency and v is a damping factor. In general, the plasma frequency may be thought of as a limit on wave propagation through a medium: waves propagate when the frequency is greater than the plasma frequency, and waves do not propagate (e.g., are reflected) when the frequency is less than the plasma frequency. Simple conducting systems (such as plasmas) have a dispersive dielectric response. The degree to which an artificial medium obeys EQTN. A must often be determined empirically and depends on the construction materials and on the geometric properties that determine f<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>relative to the inter-element spacing of the metal scattering elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The plasma frequency is the natural frequency of charge density oscillations (&ldquo;plasmons&rdquo;), and may be expressed as: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> where n<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>is the charge carrier density and m<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>is an effective carrier mass. For the carrier densities associated with typical conductors, the plasma frequency f<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>usually occurs in the optical or ultraviolet bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The Pendry reference that has been incorporated herein by reference teaches a thin wire media&mdash;in which the wire diameters are significantly smaller than the skin depth of the metal&mdash;can be engineered with a plasma frequency in the microwave regime, below the point at which diffraction due to the finite wire spacing occurs. By restricting the currents to flow in thin wires, the effective charge density is reduced, thereby lowering the plasma frequency. Also, the inductance associated with the wires acts as an effective mass that is larger than that of the electrons, further reducing the plasma frequency. By incorporating these effects, the Pendry reference provides the following prediction for the plasma frequency of a thin wire medium:

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> where c<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the speed of light in a vacuum, d is the thin wire lattice spacing, and r is the wire diameter. The length of the wires is assumed to be infinite and, in practice, preferably the wire length should be much larger than the wire spacing, which in turn should be much larger than the radius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the Pendry reference suggests a wire radius of approximately one micron for a lattice spacing of 1 cm&mdash;resulting in a ratio, d/r, on the order of or greater than 10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>. Note that the charge mass and density that generally occurs in the expression for the f<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>are replaced by the parameters (e.g., d and r) of the wire medium. Note also that the interpretation of the origin of the &ldquo;plasma&rdquo; frequency for a composite structure is not essential to this invention, only that the frequency-dependent permittivity have the form as above, with the plasma (or cutoff) frequency occurring in the microwave range or other desired ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Any conducting element that has an inductance can also be utilized as the repeated element that forms a plasmonic medium. In the thin wire medium, increased inductance is primarily achieved by making the wires very thin; However, the inductance can also be increased by other means, such as arranging inductive loops within the medium, or even the inclusion of actual inductive elements within the circuit. Thicker loop-wire media can be comprised, for example, of wire coils or wire lengths having periodic loops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composite, or hybrid, material comprised of a host dielectric with an artificial plasmon medium embedded therein, whereby the composite material has an index of refraction and impedance both substantially equal to that of the surrounding medium. As discussed below, it is assumed that the index of refraction and impedance of the medium are both measured relative to the surrounding medium, and accordingly the term &ldquo;relative&rdquo; as used herein in describing terms such as &ldquo;index&rdquo; and &ldquo;impedance&rdquo; is intended to refer to a comparison to the surrounding medium. An invention embodiment may be considered an artificial plasmon medium. Behavior of embodiments of the present invention is modeled on the assumption that the host dielectric has a uniform dielectric constant or function (it is noted that as used herein the terms dielectric constant and dielectric function are intended to be interchangeable). However, an effective dielectric function of the host medium can be substituted for the uniform constant and the properties in the frequency range of interest will be substantially unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The conductivity of the conducting elements of the composite embodiments of the present invention approaches infinity, but any good metal conductor such as copper or silver provides a close behavioral agreement to ideal simulations. For the composite material, the effective permittivity &egr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>is expressed as: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The composite materials of the present invention follow these relationships, and achieve good transparency and low reflectance for electromagnetic radiation in a desired frequency range. By way of example, a conductor of the present invention may be varied in spacing and/or geometry to control the plasma frequency &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>, and thereby &ldquo;tune&rdquo; the composite of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the absence of the dielectric, the only variable parameter for behavior of a plasmon medium is the plasma frequency f<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>, with the index of refraction able to be expressed as </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be further described through reference to example structural embodiments. In considering the FIGS. used to illustrated these structural embodiments, it will be appreciated that they have not been drawn to scale, and that some elements have been exaggerated in scale for purposes of illustration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a top plan cross section and a side elevational cross section, respectively, of a portion of an embodiment of a composite material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The composite material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a dielectric host <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a conductor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> embedded therein. It is noted that the term &ldquo;dielectric&rdquo; as used herein in reference to a material is intended to broadly refer to materials that have a relative dielectric constant greater than 1, where the relative dielectric constant is expressed as the ratio of the material permittivity &egr; to free space permittivity &egr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>(8.85&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12 </superscript></highlight>F/m). In more general terms, dielectric materials may be thought of as materials that are poor electrical conductors but that are efficient supporters of electrostatic fields. In practice most dielectric materials, but not all, are solid. Examples of dielectric materials useful for practice of embodiments of the current invention include, but are not limited to, porcelain such as ceramics, mica, glass, and plastics such as thermoplastics, polymers, resins, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The term conductor as used herein is intended to broadly refer to materials that provide a useful means for conducting current. By way of example, many metals are known to provide relatively low electrical resistance with the result that they may be considered conductors. Preferred conductors for the practice of embodiments of the invention include aluminum, copper, gold, and silver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the preferred conductor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of portions that are generally elongated and parallel to one another, with a space between portions of distance d. Preferably, d is less than the size of a wavelength of the incident electromagnetic waves. Spacing by distances d of this order allow the composite material of the invention to be modeled as a continuous medium for determination of permittivity &egr;. Also, the preferred conductors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have a generally cylindrical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A most preferred conductor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises thin copper wires. These conductors offer the advantages of being readily commercially available at a low cost, and of being relatively easy to work with. Also, matrices of thin wiring have been shown to be useful for comprising an artificial plasmon medium, as discussed by Pendry et al., &ldquo;Extremely Low Frequency Plasmons in Metallic Mesostructures,&rdquo; Physical Review Letters, 76(25):4773-6, 1996; incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a top plan cross section of another composite material embodiment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The composite material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a dielectric host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a conductor that has been configured as a plurality of portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As with the embodiment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the conductor portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the embodiment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably elongated cylindrical shapes, with lengths of copper wire most preferred. The conductor portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are preferably separated from one another by distances d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as illustrated with each of d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being less than the size of a wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of interest. Distances d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be, but are not required to be, substantially equal. The conductor portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are thereby regularly spaced from one another, with the intent that the term &ldquo;regularly spaced&rdquo; as used herein broadly refer to a condition of being consistently spaced from one another. It is also noted that the term &ldquo;regularly spacing&rdquo; as used herein does not necessarily require that spacing be equal along all axis of orientation (e.g., d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not necessarily equal). Finally, it is noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (as well as all other FIGS.) have not been drawn to any particular scale, and that for instance the diameter of the conductors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be greatly exaggerated in comparison to d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and/or d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the individual conductors may be thought of as organized in a plurality of planar layers separated from one another by the distance d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in the perspective schematic representation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> where each planar layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> represents a plurality of parallel conductors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and where the dielectric host <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a transparent dashed line &ldquo;box&rdquo;. The embodiment 20 may also be thought of as having each plane of its conductors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a single &ldquo;dimension.&rdquo; That is, the conductors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in each plane generally lie along a single axis of orientation (e.g., the x-axis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will comprise conductors oriented along more than one axis of orientation. The composite material embodiment 50 represented by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, for example, illustrates the conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> oriented along two axes and embedded in a dielectric host <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the composite material embodiment 50 may be thought to generally extend along both the x-axis and the y-axis. This is illustrated schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, with the conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represented as lines, and the dielectric host <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> represented as a dashed line box. Such a configuration thereby can also be considered to have a plurality of first conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> organized into substantially planar rows, and a plurality of second conductors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> organized into substantially planar columns. When laid out along an x and y axis as in the embodiment 50, these planes are substantially normal to one another. The planar columns are preferably separated from one another by a distance less than a wavelength of electromagnetic wave of interest, with the planar rows likewise preferably spaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Other invention embodiments may additionally comprise conductors oriented along additional axes. By way of example, a composite material <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is represented schematically in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> plurality of conductors <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> represented as lines may be oriented along the x, y and z axis to result in a &ldquo;three dimensional&rdquo; configuration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other conductor orientations are also possible within the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that conductors of embodiments of the present invention may comprise configurations other than substantially straight portions as shown in the embodiments 10, 20, and 50. Indeed, depending on a particular application it may be desirable to &ldquo;tune&rdquo; the composite material by altering the electrical properties of the conductor. By way of example, the diameter, geometry, and/or spacing of the conductor could be altered. With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) by way of example, alternate conductor shapes are illustrated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with a plurality of loops <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The loops <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are preferably of substantially uniform diameter, and are preferably substantially regularly spaced along the length of the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. That is, a substantially uniform distance preferably separates each loop <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> along a length of a conductor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Those knowledgeable in the art will appreciate that the loops <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> comprise inductive elements, and thereby serve to increase the impedance of the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Varying the diameter and number of the loops <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> will of course alter the electrical properties of the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and may thereby be used to further &ldquo;tune&rdquo; a resulting composite material so that the composite refractive index and/or reflection coefficient is substantially equal to 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows conductors <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> in the form of spring-like coils. It will be appreciated that the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> may be used in combination with a dielectric host to comprise a composite material of the invention. By way of illustration, the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> could be used in any of the embodiments 10, 20, 50 or 100 of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), for instance, shows an additional alternate conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> embedded in a host dielectric <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. The conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is characterized in that each conductor <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> has a number of individual linked portions that are substantially straight, are at right angles to one another, with each of the portions lying along one of the x, y or z axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Those knowledgeable in the art will appreciate that many additional conductor geometries will be useful in practice of the invention. By way of example, non-cylindrical geometries comprising substantially square, rectangular, or eleptical cross sections may be of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a side elevational view of a portion of an additional embodiment 200 of the invention comprising a loop-wire artificial plasmon composite material. The embodiment 200 comprises a plurality of conductors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that may be considered to have the geometry of the conductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). That is, the conductors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> generally may comprise a plurality of connected loops, or may comprise coils. The conductors <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are wrapped around a dielectric host, which is in the form of a plurality of elongated members <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> that may comprise by way of example nylon rods. The nylon rods are preferably substantially parallel to one another, and are preferably separated from one another by a substantially equal distance. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a top plan cross section of a portion of the embodiment 200, illustrating the conductor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> surrounding the dielectric nylon rod host <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the composite material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is tunable by design by altering the wire conductor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> diameter and spacing, for instance, to achieve an index of refraction and impedance as may be desired for electromagnetic waves in a desired wavelength range. FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrate the result of computer simulations run on the composite material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, using thin copper wire as the conductor having vertical spacing between loops of about 8 mm, horizontal spacing between rods of about 8 mm, and using 6-32 nylon rods. FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show a predicted matching condition close to 8 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> One advantage of embodiments of the composite material of the present invention is that the composites can achieve mechanical strength and may be desirably conformed for particular applications. Indeed, those knowledgeable in the art will appreciated that using a preferred dielectric host such as a polymer and a preferred conductor such as thin copper wire, composite materials of the invention will lend themselves well to being readily configured to a multiplicity of applications. By way of example, a composite material of the invention may have utility as an electromagnetically transparent &ldquo;window&rdquo; for covering electronics. Examples include, but are not limited to, mechanically protective but electromagnetically transparent electronics housings and cabinets, antennae for communications devices such as cellular phones and transmission centers, building materials for structures used for communications such as satellite stations, &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; materials for military applications including airplanes, ships, submarines, land vehicles, individual armor; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A particular example is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, where a composite material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the invention has been configured in the general shape of a &ldquo;dome&rdquo; for use as a radome for covering radar equipment.
