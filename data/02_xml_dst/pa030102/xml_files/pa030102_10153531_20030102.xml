<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to use of milk protein hydrolysates in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X and a to a method of treatment of diabetes or syndrome X which comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising such milk protein hydrolysates. The present invention also relates to the use of sweet whey or acid whey proteins or protein hydrolysates in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X and to a method of treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X that comprises administering an effective amount of such compositions. Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of caseino-glycomacropeptide (&ldquo;CGMP&rdquo;) in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X and to a method of treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X that comprises administering an effective amount of such compositions. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of NCI-H716 cells, obtained from a cell line derived from a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of human caecum (de Bruine et al., Virchows Archiv B Cell Pathol 62:311-320 (1992)), as a model to measure proglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 secretion. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> B. Chabance et al. (Biochimie 80, 155-165, 1998) have shown that after eating, many peptides derived from &agr;-, &bgr;- or &kgr;-caseins, including CGMP, can be detected in stomach and blood, thus indicating that these peptides can cross the intestinal barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by the failure of body tissues to store carbohydrates at the normal rate. Resistance to the action of insulin is the most important factor to type II diabetes. When this resistance exceeds the capacity of the beta cells to produce insulin, a person becomes diabetic. During the last 70 years people suffering from diabetes have been greatly aided by receiving controlled amounts of insulin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Historically, insulin has been administered by injection to combat diabetes. Administering an injection requires expertise, and compared to oral administration, injecting a medicament is not as safe, convenient or acceptable to the patient. In light of these concerns, it is clear that there is a need for new nutritional or therapeutic products that may be administered orally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Proglucagon, synthesized by L-cells found in the distal ileum and colon, is known to be post-translationally processed into peptides including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a potent insulin secretagogue. In addition to potentiating glucose-induced insulin secretion, GLP-1 is known to stimulate proinsulin gene expression and proinsulin biosynthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other actions of GLP-1 include the inhibition of glucagon secretion and gastric motility. GLP-1 can bind in the brain, promoting satiety and suppressing food intake. Increasing insulin secretion is a key goal in the treatment of type II diabetes and stimulation of endogenous release of GLP-1 is a potential/prospective alternative to intravenous administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Improving glucose control in diabetes can provide the advantage of reducing the associated risks of hyperglycemia, including blindness, limb amputations, kidney failure and cardiovascular disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A number of in vitro cell models of animal origin have been developed to study the regulation of GLP-1 secretion including a fetal rat intestinal cell culture, an isolated canine L cell, a secretin tumor cell (STC-1) cell line, and the GLUTag enteroendocrine cell line. While these models have provided useful information regarding the factors which regulate GLP-1 secretion and proglucagon expression, they suffer from the problem that they do not necessarily represent the same regulators and mechanisms which are active and occur in human L cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the problems set out above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Remarkably, it has now been found that a milk protein hydrolysate can induce the release of GLP-1 and can be used to improve glucose homeostasis in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In fact, in contrast to known studies, NCI-H716 cells have now been employed, obtained from a cell line derived from a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of human caecum (de Bruine et al, Virchows Archiv B Cell Pathol 62:311-320 (1992)). Surprisingly, the NCI-H716 cell line has now been found to be a good model for the first study of potential secretagogues that regulate human GLP-1 secretion in vitro. Up to now, NCI-H716 cell line was not known to be suitable for this purpose. Nor was it previously known that any human cell line would be capable of releasing GLP-1. So far, only cell lines derived from animals were available to serve as in vitro models to study proglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 secretion. This property of the present cell line will enable much simplified research on GLP-1 release. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the results obtained by the use of a human cell line to conduct studies on the production or function of GLP-1 will be much more relevant than results derived from other animal models. In short, the NCI-H716 cell line derived from a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of human caecum is likely to become a key tool for studying proglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 secretion in humans. This cell line is deposited and available at the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) under the ATCC Number CCL-251. The depositor is A. F. Gazdar and the tissue of origin is the caecum: it is derived from a colorectal adenocarcinoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in a first aspect the present invention relates to the use of a milk protein hydrolysate that is capable of inducing release of GLP-1 in the manufacture of a composition for the treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of treatment or prevention of diabetes or syndrome X which comprises administering to a person in need of such treatment an effective amount of a milk protein hydrolysate which is capable of inducing release of GLP-1 in an amount effective to treat or prevent diabetes or syndrome X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, the present invention provides a model for the study of proglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 production by humans which includes cells obtained from a cell line derived from an adenocarcinoma of human caecum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for assessing proglucagon expression and GLP-1 release in humans by utilizing a cell line derived from an adenocarcinoma of human caecum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a cell line derived from an adenocarcinoma of human caecum to assess proglucagon gene expression and GLP-1 release in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a composition that can be administered orally. This is both safer and more convenient for the patient than conventional treatment by injection of insulin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is the reduced risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Conventional injection of insulin carries with it the undesirable side effect of hypoglycemic reactions. The use of oral hypoglycemic agents to augment insulin secretion can also result in hypoglycemic reactions. Once the plasma glucose levels reach fasting values, GLP-1 no longer stimulates insulin release. The advantage of enhancing insulin release via GLP-1 secretion is that the action of GLP-1 is glucose dependent and therefore eliminates the risk of hypoglycemia, i.e., the release of insulin is very fine-tuned with respect to the blood glucose levels that are actually present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage is that GLP-1 remains active in persons with diabetes whereas incretin hormone, glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) loses effectiveness in treating diabetes in such subjects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the present invention is that it provides metabolic benefits in addition to the augmentation of insulin release. Conventional treatments raise insulin levels, but the present invention in addition increases insulin mRNA, increases beta-cell sensitivity, and lowers glucagon levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a composition that can regulate appetite and reduce food intake. This action is beneficial in controlling diabetes and syndrome X.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Within the context of this specification the word &ldquo;comprises&rdquo; is taken to mean &ldquo;includes, among other things&rdquo;. It is not intended to be construed as &ldquo;consists of&rdquo; or &ldquo;only&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Within the context of this specification the term &ldquo;milk protein hydrolysate&rdquo; is taken to mean milk proteins that have been subjected to any type of hydrolysis. Thus, such milk protein hydrolysate may even include intact proteins that escaped hydrolysis and also any fractions of proteins obtained by the treatment of the hydrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Within the context of this specification the terms &ldquo;sweet whey&rdquo; and &ldquo;acid whey&rdquo; are also considered to be possible milk protein hydrolysates, because these materials are the product of enzymatic or acid hydrolysis of milk proteins. Whey, however, as is well known in the art, can also comprise intact proteins as well as different fractions of hydrolysed proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> CGMP is a milk protein hydrolysate. It is a sialylated macropeptide that is formed by the action of rennet or pepsin on kappa-casein from the milk of mammals. An alternative name for CGMP is k-caseinoglyco-peptide. CGMP-Ca and CGMP-Na are used as abbreviations for the calcium salt and sodium salt, respectively, of CGMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The preferred milk protein hydrolysates that are capable of inducing release of GLP-1 comprise CGMP, or a mimetic, a homologue or a fragment thereof that retains the activity of CGMP. A particularly preferred embodiment of the milk protein hydrolysate is the calcium or sodium salts of CGMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the composition includes one or more of a source of carbohydrate, a source of fat and a source of protein. The preferred compositions comprise from about 15 to about 25% protein, from about 10 to about 30% fat, and from about 40 to about 60% carbohydrate. Preferably, at least a portion of the protein is provided as protein from sweet whey or acid whey, while more preferably, at least a portion of the protein is provided as CGMP. Other preferred milk protein hydrolysates which are capable of inducing release of GLP-1 comprise proteins that are present in sweet whey or acid whey. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One or more of these compositions are advantageously incorporated into a food formula. When this is done, the composition comprises from about 1 to about 50 grams, preferably from 5 to about 25 grams and more preferably from 5 to about 10 grams CGMP per 100 g of food formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The composition may be administered to provide sufficient whey protein, CGMP or mixtures thereof to improve glucose metabolism in humans or companion animals by increasing plasma GLP-1 levels and controlling glycemic response. The exact amount can be determined without difficulty by administering different amounts until the correct effect is seen. The dose of whey proteins and/or CGMP is typically from about 1 to about 50 grams per day, preferably from 9 to about 18 grams per day and more preferably from 3 to about 6 grams consumed at three times throughout a day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art how a milk or whey protein can be obtained. In general, skimmed milk is treated with enzymes or acid in order to finally separate sweet or acid whey, respectively, which is thus deprived from the clotted casein. The sweet or acid whey then comprises whet protein hydrolysates and also minor proteins, which remain intact. Thus, sweet or acid whey can be obtained, e.g., as a side product from the production of cheese. Although it is not necessary to additionally process whey for use in the present invention, it is obvious to the skilled artisan that further processing is possible. For example, sweet and acid fluid whey can be condensed, dried, fermented, delactosed, demineralized, and deproteinated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to use whey concentrate or whey powder. The latter is especially convenient for addition to any chosen food product to produce the desired effect. It is also clear to the skilled artisan that protein hydrolysates present in sweet or acid whey can be further hydrolysed, e.g., to prepare a hypoallergenic whey protein hydrolysate. According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,532, whey protein material may be subjected to a second hydrolysis with a proteolytic enzyme in order to hydrolyse the minor proteins remaining intact after the first hydrolysis. Such a hydrolysate may then be used as a liquid or may be dried to a powder for incorporation into numerous food products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> CGMP may be obtained by an ion-exchange treatment of a liquid lactic raw material containing CGMP. Suitable starting materials of lactic origin may include for example, any of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> the product of the hydrolysis with rennet of a native casein obtained by acidic precipitation of skimmed milk with a mineral acid or acidifying ferments, optionally with addition of calcium ions, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> the hydrolysis product of a caseinate with rennet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> a sweet whey obtained after separation of casein coagulated with rennet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> a sweet whey or such a whey demineralized, for example, by electrodialysis and/or ion exchange and/or reverse osmosis, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> a concentrate of sweet whey, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> a concentrate of whey proteins obtained by ultrafiltration and diafiltration of sweet whey. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> mother liquors of the crystallization of lactose from a sweet whey, or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> a permeate of ultrafiltration of a sweet whey. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A preferable method of obtaining CGMP is described, for example, in WO98/53702, and includes the decationization of the liquid raw material, such that the pH is at a value of 1 to 4.5, bringing the liquid into contact with a weak anionic resin of hydrophobic matrix, predominantly in alkaline form up to a stabilized pH, and then separating the resin from the liquid product, followed by desorption of CGMP from the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of this composition comprises a milk protein hydrolysate. It has been shown that skimmed milk results in CGP levels of 1.1 &mgr;g/ml in human plasma. After yogurt ingestion, 2.8 &mgr;g/ml of CGP can be detected in the blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the most preferred milk protein hydrolysates comprise CGMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The composition can also contain a source of protein and at least protein hydrolysates from sweet whet or acid whey and/or CGMP. Dietary protein is preferably used as a source of protein. The dietary proteins may be any suitable dietary protein; for example animal protein (such as milk protein, meat protein or egg protein); vegetable protein (such as soy protein, wheat protein, rice protein, or pea protein); a mixture of free amino acids; or a combination thereof. Milk proteins such as casein, whey protein or soy proteins are particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The composition may also contain a source of carbohydrate and/or a source of fat. In a preferred embodiment of the composition, the fat source provides about 5% to about 55% of the energy of the nutritional formula; for example about 20% to about 50% of the energy. The lipids making up the fat source may be any suitable fat or fat mixture. Vegetable fat is particularly suitable; for example soy oil, palm oil, coconut oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, along with lecithins or the like, ether used alone or in mixtures thereof. Animal fat such as milk fat may also be added if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable to include in the composition a source of carbohydrate. When used, the carbohydrate provides about 40% to about 80% of the energy of the nutritional composition. Any suitable carbohydrate may be used, for example sucrose, lactose, glucose, fructose, corn syrup solids, and maltodextrins, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable for the composition to include dietary fibers. When used, these can provide up to about 5% of the energy of the nutritional formula. The dietary fiber may be from any suitable origin, including for example soy, pea, oat, pectin, guar gum, gum arabic, fructooligosaccharide, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, one or more suitable vitamins and/or minerals may be included in the composition in amounts that can meet appropriate guidelines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> One or more food grade emulsifiers may be incorporated into the nutritional formula if desired, such as, e.g., diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides, lecithin and mono- and di-glycerides.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The amount of GLP-1 released into the medium of NCI-H716 cells treated for 2 h with increasing concentrations (0.25-2.5 mg/ml wt/vol) of the calcium form of CGMP is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Secretion of GLP-1 by NCI-H716 cells into the medium was normalized to the total GLP-1 content (secretion&plus;cells) of the culture well and is expressed as a percentage of the control value. CGMP induced a dose-dependent increase in GLP-1 concentrations with maximum secretion reaching 259&plusmn;77% (n&equals;minimum of 3) of the control values with 2.5 mg/ml of CGMP-Ca. The symbol * represents a significant difference from control values (p&lt;0.05). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the amount of GLP-1 released into the medium of NCI-H716 cells treated for 2 h with increasing concentrations (0.25-2.5 mg/ml wt/vol) of the sodium form of CGMP. Again, secretion into the medium was normalized to the total cell content of the culture well and is expressed as a percentage of the control value. CGMP induced an increase in GLP-1 concentrations with maximum secretion reaching 255&plusmn;41% (n&equals;minimum of 3) of the control values with 2.5 mg/ml of CGMP-Ca. The symbol * represents a significant difference from control values (p&lt;0.05). </paragraph>

Secretion into the medium was normalized to the total cell content of the culture well and is expressed as a percentage of the control value. The composition of the different fractions was the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Fraction 1) Hydrolyzed CGMP, pure peptidic material, no phosphorus, no sialic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Fraction 2) Hydrolyzed CGMP, high sialic acid, high phosphorus content. Sample is in the Na-form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Fraction 3) CGMP fraction enriched in CMPa and CMPb, the phosphorylated compounds of CGMP. Sample is in the Na-form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Fraction 4) CGMP fraction enriched in sialic acid. Sample is in the Ca-form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that the amount of GLP-1 released into the medium by all fractions, except fraction 3 (p&equals;0.085), was significantly increased with Fraction 2 resulting in the highest stimulation of 220&plusmn;41% (n&equals;3) of the control values.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Sweet and Acid Whey Stimulate the Release of Active GLP-1 in the NCI-H716 Intestinal Cell Line </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The amount of GLP-1 released into the medium after a 2 h incubation period in the presence of 5 mg/ml milk protein hydrolysates is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Sweet whey and acid whey induced an increase in GLP-1 release of 298&plusmn;34% and 284&plusmn;21%, respectively, compared to the control (p&equals;0.03 and 0.01, respectively, n&equals;3). This effect was not due to the alpha-lactose content of these fractions, as the use of an equivalent alpha-lactose dose as the one contained in the different wheys only resulted in a small increase in GLP-1 secretion (144&plusmn;32% compared to the control). Moreover, another protein hydrolysate, meat hydrolysate, did not induce such an effect on GLP-1 production when used in the same amount of 5 mg/ml (132&plusmn;6% compared to the control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The GLP-1 that was secreted and reported in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> was measured differently that that of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Here, a kit was used that only measures the active form of GLP-1, i.e., GLP-1 (7-37) or GLP-1 (7-36 amide), but not the degraded form, GLP-1 (9-36 amide), as was included in the data for FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
