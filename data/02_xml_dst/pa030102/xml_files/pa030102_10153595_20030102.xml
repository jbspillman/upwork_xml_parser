<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for determining the optimum size of a LSI chip to determine the optimum size of a LSI chip when a LSI is designed in consideration of both a cost calculated from the theoretical number of chips and the throughput of wafer processing calculated from the number of transcriptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a configuration diagram showing a conventional apparatus for determining the optimum size of a LSI chip. Referring to the figure, LSI-chip-size-information holding part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has registered LSI chip sizes; in-the-mask-limitation-information holding part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> holds the registered effective areas in each mask size; in-the-mask-chip-configuration calculating means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used for calculating the chip configuration in the mask; wafer-line-information holding part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> holds the registered effective area in a wafer line to be used; the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> calculates the theoretical number of chips, and display part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> displays held information and a calculated result. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The operation will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A, a</cross-reference> mask required for the LSI manufacturing consists of combined LSI chips and dicing lines, which will be cut on assembly, and have arranged alignment marks for wafer processing. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, the patterns on the mask are transcribed to the wafer in a step and repeat manner, and thereby spread over the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus for determining the optimum size of a LSI chip showed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, in-the-mask-chip-configuration calculating means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputs the size of the LSI chip, the wafer line name, and the mask size (for instance, 5-inch mask and 6-inch mask) from LSI-chip-size-information holding part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the effective area, on which a transcription can be done in the mask, for each mask size from in-the-mask-limitation-information holding part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively, to thereby calculate the chip configuration in the mask according to the LSI chip size, the mask size, and the effective area in the mask. Herein, the chip configuration in the mask is defined as the chip arrangement in which, for instance, two LSI chips are placed in the X direction, and three LSI chips are placed in the Y direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> inputs the calculated chip configuration in the mask and the effective area in the wafer line from wafer-line-information holding part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (because the usable area in each wafer is different in the wafer line to be used, the area is described in the information.), to thereby determine the chip configuration in the wafer in the wafer line to be used. After that, the calculating means calculates the theoretical number of chips (the number of LSI chips), and displays the theoretical number of chips in display part <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, to thereby finish its job. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Because the conventional apparatus of determining the optimum size of a LSI chip is constructed as mentioned above, it is necessary, in order to reduce the LSI manufacturing cost, to minimize the number of the transcriptions of the pattern on the mask to the wafer (to prevent the wafer processing time from being increased because of an increase in the number of the transcriptions) by use of the chip size in which the theoretical number of chips is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional apparatus the designer could confirm the theoretical number of chips, but could not confirm the number of the transcriptions. As a result, there was the problem that he could not confirm the chip configuration in which the theoretical number of chips is large and further the number of transcriptions is minimum. </paragraph>

Referring to the figure, LSI-chip-size-information holding part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has registered LSI chip sizes; in-the-mask-limitation-information holding part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> holds the registered effective area in each mask size; in the-mask-chip-configuration calculating means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> calculates a chip configuration in a mask; wafer-line-information holding part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> holds the registered effective area in a wafer line to be used; and the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> calculates the theoretical number of chips. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus for determining the optimum size of a LSI chip shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in-the-mask-chip-configuration calculating means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputs the size of the LSI chip, the name of the wafer line, and the size of the mask (for instance, 5-inch mask and 6-inch mask) from LSI-chip-size-information holding part <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and inputs the effective area in each mask size (the area in the mask on which the transcription can be done) from in-the-mask-limitation-information holding part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively, to thereby calculate the chip configuration in the mask according to the size of the LSI chip, the size of the mask, and the effective area of the mask (The in-the-mask-chip-configuration calculating step). For instance, when the size of the LSI chip is 10000&times;10000 &mgr;m, and the in-the-mask limitation information is 25000&times;21000 &mgr;m (the usable area in a 6-inch mask), the chip configuration in the mask becomes 2&times;2 (The X direction: 25000&divide;10000&equals;2.5, and the Y direction: 21000&divide;10000&equals;2.1; the chip configuration becomes 2&times;2 by dropping the fractional portion of the number.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> inputs the calculated chip configuration in the mask and the effective area in the wafer line (Because the usable area in a wafer is different depending on the wafer line to be used, the area is described in the information.) from wafer-line-information holding part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. After determining the chip configuration in the wafer in the wafer line to be used, the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> calculates the theoretical number of chips (the number of LSI chips) (The the-theoretical-number-of-chips calculating step). </paragraph>

For instance, when the minimum value of the LSI chip size is 9400&times;9400 &mgr;m, the maximum value thereof is 10600&times;10600 &mgr;m, and the step value thereof is 600 &mgr;m, the combinations of the LSI chip sizes are (1) 100000&times;10000 &mgr;m, (2) 10600&times;9400 &mgr;m, and (3) 9400&times;10600 &mgr;m. Since many LSI chips have a memory part having a determined area and a logic part having a determined area, the combination such that the LSI chip area is constant is calculated. The-combination-of-LSI-chip-sizes-information holding part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> holds those calculated combinations of LSI chip sizes.
