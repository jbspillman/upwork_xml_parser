Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the various components shown in outline or block form in the figures are individually well-known and there internal construction and operation is not critical to the making or using of this invention or to a description of the best mode of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for controlling the entire device by following programs stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, RAM (Random Access Memory) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for providing a work area for the CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the display control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for controlling display of the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and VRAM (Video RAM) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> storing image data to be displayed on the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and display control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, are connected via a CPU bus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprise a pair of liquid crystal display devices (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;LCD&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a plurality of pixels for displaying information, a pair of back-lights <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for illuminating the display screens of the LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a pair of sculptured surface prisms <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> for enlarging the display screens of the LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, wherein each of that LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, back lights <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and sculptured surface prisms <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, are provided so as to correspond to the left and right eyes of the user. The LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> have, for example, the size of 1 inch or less, 24 bit, full-color, and have so-called SVGA resolution of 800&times;600 pixels. Such LCDs are generally called micro displays, and those produced by various manufacturers, such as Colorado Micro Display or Kopin Corporation, for example, can be used. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a back-light <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is disposed on the back side of the LCD <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as viewed from the observation position of the user. Also, the sculptured surface prism <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is formed by joining two optical members, a wedge-shaped prism <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a prism <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The joining face between optical members <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a semi-transmitting curve, whereby the optical members <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>guide the incident light from the LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> over an optical path indicated by the 2-dot broken line in the figure, indicated by symbols a, b, and c, to the observation position. Also, external light is guided to the observation position over the optical path indicated by the two-dot broken line indicated by d and c. Due to the sculptured surface prism <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the user can superimpose and view the enlarged image of the LCDs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and external scenery (e.g., the buttons on the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the hand of the user), at the above observation position. The technology for these optical systems is already disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-274144 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-10502 and so forth. Using these technologies allows the user to operate the buttons on the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and view the information on a large screen, in the state of wearing the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Here, in the event that a desired item is selected by the user on the processing menu screen, processing corresponding to the selected item is activated. For example, in the event that the item &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is selected, mail processing is executed in step S<highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In the event that the item &ldquo;Web&rdquo; is selected, Web processing with the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is executed In step S<highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In the event that the item &ldquo;other&rdquo; is selected, other processing is executed in step S<highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. In the event that the &ldquo;quit&rdquo; item is selected, the processing quits, and the state returns to a normal call waiting state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the event that &ldquo;information terminal (HMD)&rdquo; is selected as the item above, in step <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, dial-up setting is performed. Here, the screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is displayed, predetermined items are input in this screen, and either &ldquo;execute&rdquo; or &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; are selected. In the event that &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; is selected, dial-up settings are performed again. In the event that &ldquo;execute&rdquo; is selected, close-distance wireless connection is performed in step S<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Here, the terminal capable of close-distance wireless communication is searched for, and a connection is established. Once a connection is established with information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in step S<highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> two child processes are generated for the dial-up process in step S<highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> and a button input process in step S<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, and these are executed in parallel. Depending on the operating system, threads may be used instead of processes, and it should be noted that in the following embodiment, replacing the processes with threads does not change the processing flow in any way whatsoever, and exactly the same advantages can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the dial-up process in step S<highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, first, in step S<highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, cellular telephone network connection processing is performed. With this cellular telephone network connection processing, connection is made to an ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> via a cellular telephone network, based on the data input in the above step S<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Now, in the event that authentication is established, a connection with the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is set. At the same time, a connection is also set with the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected by close-distance wireless communication, for data transfer with ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>, communication control processing, i.e., control of data transfer using the connections set in the above step S<highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, is performed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, data based on the HTTP protocol is exchanged between the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Communication is carried out by converting this data into packets/frames following communication protocols of a lower order, i.e., of the close-distance wireless communication network and cellular telephone network. For example, the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> transmits data with PPP frames according to the PPP protocol, so in the case of using Bluetooth technology, the PPP frame data is reconfigured into packet data such as L2CAP or the like, and sent to the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Data from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to reverse conversion, and transmitted to the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Also, in the event that a wireless LAN such as IEEE 802.11 is used instead of Bluetooth, the PPP frame data is converted into MAC frame data and transmitted to the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and data from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to reverse conversion, and transmitted to the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>, the flow waits for an end notification from the button input process (step S<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>), and repeats the above processing until receiving the button input process end notification. Upon receiving the button input process ends notification, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>, the cellular telephone network cut off processing is performed, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>, the dial-up process end notification is made to the parent process, thereby ending the process. Then, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight>, all connections between the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> set with the close-distance wireless communication are ended, and cut-off of the close-distance wireless communication is performed. Then, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the button input process (step S<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) executed in parallel with the above dial-up process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, first, in step S<highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, a connection for transmitting button input data with the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set, and a communication port is determined. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>, the flow waits for input from the input button group <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and upon input from the input button group <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>, the code of the pressed button is written to a button input communication port and transmitted to the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and in the following step S<highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight>, judgement is made regarding whether or not the pressed button is the menu button &ldquo;M&rdquo;. Here, in the event that the pressed button is not the menu button &ldquo;M&rdquo;, the flow returns to the above step S<highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. In the event that the pressed button is the menu button &ldquo;M&rdquo;, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>, the connection with the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for button input communication is ended, and the ending of the process is notified to the dial-up process, thereby ending the button input process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Next, the processing of the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Upon the electric power being turned on to the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, first, initialization is performed in step S<highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Here, programs stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are read out, the back-light <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is lit, and the WWW browser screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is displayed on the LCD <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight>, connection preparations for close-distance wireless communication is performed, and the flow waits for connection request from the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Now, in the event that there is a connection request from the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, a close-distance wireless communication path is set following the connection request from the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a button input connection for accepting button input data, and a dial-up connection for exchanging data with servers on the Internet, are set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>, the flow waits for arrival of the data to the button input connection set in the above step S<highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, and upon the data arriving, this data is accepted as an event, and the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight>, the event received in the above step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is interpreted, and appropriated to the various processes. Now, in the event that the above event is the menu button &ldquo;M&rdquo; event, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight>, in the event that this is URL processing request, to step S<highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight>, and in the event of the other processing, to step S<highlight><bold>2700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight>, menu button event processing is started, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>2510</bold></highlight>, all close-distance wireless connections with the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are ended. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2520</bold></highlight>, data which needs to be saved is written from the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the ROM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and electric power is turned off and quit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight>, a URL data request is started. Here, examples of typical URL processing request events are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> (1) A case wherein the user makes a list display of URLs which the user has saved beforehand, from the &ldquo;favorites&rdquo; menu in the display area <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and uses a selection button (with the present embodiment, in the event that the push button <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> has been pushed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (2) A case wherein, in a state where the cursor exists over an anchor tag indicating the link destination in the contents display area <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the selection button is pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (3) A case wherein the selection button is pressed immediately following the user directly inputting the URL in the address display area <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In these cases, the URL data processing from step S<highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight> on is performed. In step S<highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>, judgment is made regarding whether or not the specified URL is a URL corresponding to data existing within this information terminal, based on the analysis results of the specified URL information. In the event that the specified URL is a URL corresponding to data which exists within this information terminal, in step S<highlight><bold>2640</bold></highlight> the HTML file within the terminal corresponding to the specified URL is read out from the cache area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and stored in the HTTP data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>2660</bold></highlight>, the HTTP data stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is analyzed and converted into screen display data. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight>, the processed data is transferred to VRAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, displayed on the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the event that judgement is made that the URL specified in the above step S<highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight> is not a URL corresponding to data existing within this information terminal, in step S<highlight><bold>2620</bold></highlight>, the URL information is transmitted as an HTTP protocol such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, via a dial-up connection for performing exchange of HTTP data, and connection is made with the WWW server <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> via the ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2630</bold></highlight>, the file specified by the URL is obtained and stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>2660</bold></highlight>, the HTTP data stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is analyzed, and converted into screen display data. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight>, the processed data is transferred to the VRAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and displayed with the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2700</bold></highlight>, other processing is started. Examples of other processing include, for example, moving of the cursor by the 4-directional arrow buttons of the cursor moving/selecting button <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, screen scrolling by pushing of the cursor moving/selecting button to <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within a scroll bar area of the screen, text input by numeral/character buttons in the input button group <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and so forth. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>2710</bold></highlight>, processing corresponding to each of the events, such as moving the cursor, text input, etc., is performed, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight>, the processed data is transferred to the VRAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and displayed on the display means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and then the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present embodiment, a large screen can be used to view information on the network, without compromising portability or operability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> With the present embodiment, close-distance wireless communication is used for communication between the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but infrared communication methods such as IrDA or the like, for example, may be used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> are flowcharts illustrating the processing procedures with the portable information terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating the processing procedures with a cellular telephone connected to the portable information terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention. With the present embodiment, the configuration of the first embodiment will be primarily used, and only the differing components will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With the first embodiment, upon the user instructing connection with the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the close-distance wireless communication between the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the cellular telephone network between the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and ISP Gateway server <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, are connected, and these connections are maintained until there are ending instructions for the entire operations (i.e., until the menu button &ldquo;M&rdquo; is pressed). Conversely, with the present embodiment, the cellular telephone network is connected only in the event that the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> instructs access to the Internet, in order to reduce connection costs with the cellular telephone network. In this case, work such as creating documents or tabulating can be performed at the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by button input from the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in a state of being offline from the Internet, while accessing the Internet as necessary to obtain data. This allows for a wider range of applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> These operations will be described. First, the processing at the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> differ from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> (the first embodiment) with regard to steps S<highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2615</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>2635</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight>, the close-distance wireless communication path is set following a connection request from the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a connection is set for accepting button input data. Then the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Also, the present embodiment differs in the point that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in the event that judgment is made that the data for which a URL data request has been made is not in this device, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2615</bold></highlight>. In this step S<highlight><bold>2615</bold></highlight>, a request is made to the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for setting a connection, by which to exchange data with a WWW server <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> on the Internet, as to the close-distance wireless communication path already set between the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby establishing a dial-up connection. This time, a menu such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is displayed on the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so as to allow input regarding the dial-up information from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby ensuring handiness for the user. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>2620</bold></highlight>, in the same manner as with a first embodiment, connection is made with the WWW server <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> specified by the URL, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>2630</bold></highlight>, data is obtained from the WWW server <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>2635</bold></highlight>, a dial-up connection end request set in step S<highlight><bold>2615</bold></highlight> is sent to the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby ending the connection, and the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2660</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, the processing of the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In the processing of the cellular telephone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment, the dial-up process differs from the dial-up process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>) of the first embodiment. Specifically, with the dial-up process according to the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, first, in step S<highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight>, the flow waits for a dial-up connection request from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and upon a connection request occurring, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1411</bold></highlight>, dial-up information is received from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, connection is made with the cellular telephone network, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight>, judgement is made regarding whether or not there is a cutoff request from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, in the event that there is no cut-off request from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in step S<highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>, the flow waits for an end notification from the button input process (step S<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>), and in the event that no end notification of the button input process is received, in step S<highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>, communication control processing the same as with a first embodiment is performed, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight>. In the state wherein there is no cut-off request from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the above communication control processing up to receiving the end notification from the button input process (step S<highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>) is repeatedly performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Upon the cut-off request coming from the information terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the above step S<highlight><bold>1415</bold></highlight>, the cut-off process for the cellular telephone network is performed in step S<highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>, and the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the button input process end notification in step S<highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>, the cellular telephone network cut-off processing is performed in step S<highlight><bold>1445</bold></highlight>, and in the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>, the dial-up process end notification is made to the parent process, thereby ending this process. Then, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
