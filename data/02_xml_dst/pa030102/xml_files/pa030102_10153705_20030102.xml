<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a medical bladed device having a quadrangular pyramid shaped cutting blade portion formed thereto, and more particularly to a medical bladed device which provides excellent cutting performance during incision of living body tissue, inexpensiveness, and high endurance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A medical bladed device has a function of forming a primary incision to a living body tissue by using a sharp tip portion thereof or by using a sharp cutting blade thereof, and has also a function of cutting open a living body tissue having a primary incision formed thereto by using a cutting blade thereof. The cutting performance of the medical bladed device is determined by the counterforce arisen during the forming of the primary incision and the counterforce arisen during the incising of the living body tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More particularly, a medical bladed device having a cutting blade portion formed on a tip-side thereof with a quadrangular (e.g., rhombus shape) cross section is purposed for piercing, incising, or cutting off an extremely unsteady affected area with delicate manipulation of the finger tips by a careful operator, and has a sharp tip portion formed thereto, in which each side comprising the quadrangular shape is concentrated at the tip portion, thereby the sharp tip portion pierces a targeted living body tissue and a cutting blade extending from the tip portion passes through the living body tissue to widen or cut off the targeted area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Examples of the medical bladed device are a medical knife used in brain surgery, a medical knife used in ophthalmologic surgery for forming an incision by incising the cornea or a space between the cornea and the sclera, or a suture needle for suturing an incision. A good cutting performance, which includes a property of having little pierce counterforce when piercing a living body tissue and a property of having little incision counterforce when cutting open a living body tissue, and also rigidity (inflexibility), which is desired by physicians in handling a living body tissue are required for delicately manipulating the medical bladed device; in addition, other properties, such as excellent endurance against extensive repetitive use and inexpensiveness are also required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Medical knives or suture needles, for example, used in ophthalmologic surgery have a tip portion being narrowly sharpened for enhancing piercing performance. However, narrowly sharpening the tip portion causes loss of endurance since the rigidity (inflexibility) of the tip portion decreases in association with narrowing and sharpening the tip portion. Furthermore, depending on the living body tissue, the tip portion will be unable to pierce if the tip portion is narrowly sharpened too excessively. Such problems prevents a physician from desirably performing an incising procedure, causes enormous stress for the physician, and may adversely affect proceeding of an operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the cutting blade portion formed proximally to a tip-side has a quadrangular shaped cross section, a sharp peak, which has four sides (ridgelines forming the cutting blade and the back) matching at the tip, is required to be formed thereto for enhancing piercing performance. However, the process of matching the four sides at a single point causes increase in manufacture cost since device(s) for such process and product(s) are required to be controlled with extreme delicacy. Therefore, the tip portion, in actual circumstance, is corrected by hand after the tip portion and the cutting blade portion extending from the tip portion are processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present applicant has already developed a technology relating to a suture needle capable of solving the aforementioned problems and has obtained a patent (Japanese Patent No. 1850827) thereof. This technology relates to a bladed suture needle having a three-faced tip portion, in which a quadrangular pyramid-like bladed suture needle has a three-faced tip portion consisted of two adjacent faces and one face formed by grinding or polishing two remaining faces of the quadrangular pyramid-like bladed suture needle. By forming the three-faced tip portion, the suture needle can have a triangle shaped cross section with the three faces constituting the triangle matched precisely at a peak portion for enabling excellent piercing performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing the suture needle, two faces of a quadrangular pyramid-shaped portion are grinded or polished toward the remaining two sides of the quadrangular pyramid-shaped portion, so that a peak can be formed where each side is matched at the peak. This method is extremely simple compared to a method of polishing or grinding each four faces, so that a peak can be formed where four ridgelines formed between each face is matched at the peak. Accordingly, manufacture cost will not rise and a suture needle having excellent piercing performance can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An attempt of applying the same technology of the suture needle for manufacturing a medical bladed device (including a medical knife) based on the technology revealed some problems. That is, the medical bladed device being applied with such technology revealed a problem in manipulability owing to the shape of the three faced tip portion, wherein in some cases the medical bladed device can provide excellent manipulability with excellent cutting performance and high inflexibility, while in other cases the medical bladed device is unable to provide excellent cutting performance, or the medical bladed device, though being capable of providing satisfactory cutting performance, displays low inflexibility. That is, the medical bladed device revealed poor balance between cutting performance and inflexibility, lack of consistency in performance, and difficulty in performing steady manipulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, piercing performance of the medical bladed device deteriorates and leads to a problem of poor cutting performance (including piercing performance) when the angle formed by two cutting blades among the three faces of the tip portion (cutting blade portion) become exceedingly larger than that of the cutting blades of the quadrangular pyramid shaped portion or when the three faced portion of the tip portion make up a large portion of the quadrangular pyramid shaped portion. Conversely, inflexibility decreases and leads to adverse results in manipulability when the angle formed by cutting blades of the tip portion become exceedingly small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a medical bladed device for improving cutting performance and manipulability upon living body tissue and for improving endurance while preventing rise in manufacture cost. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For solving the aforementioned problems, the inventor(s) of the present invention has performed an experiment for applying the technology of the suture needle to a medical bladed device (including a medical knife, a suture needle). In this experiment, various test pieces of medical knives were prepared in search for better cutting performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Cutting performance of medical bladed devices can be judged qualitatively based on the pierce counterforce felt by a manipulating physician during piercing of a living body tissue in forming a primary incision and the incision counterforce felt by the manipulating physician during widening of the primary incision. In addition to the cutting performance, inflexibility based on the flexibility of the bladed device during incision of the living body tissue is also a large factor for judgment when the medical bladed device is actually used for incising the living tissue, but is however a factor often depending on the preference of the physician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The inventor(s) of the present invention with the cooperation of several physicians has experimented the cutting performance of the medical bladed device and has found that, although slightly dispersed depending on the physician, the bladed device is judged to have &ldquo;poor cutting performance&rdquo; when pierce counterforce and incision counterforce exceeds from 190 mN (milli-Newtons) to 200 mN. It is now to be noted that &ldquo;cutting performance&rdquo; is strongly related to controllability (manipulability) of the bladed device. Furthermore, the manipulability of the bladed device is an extremely vital element since the manner in recovery differs largely by the state of an incision formed when the bladed device of this invention is, for example, used upon a portion of an eyeball such as the cornea or the sclera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A polyurathane sheet (Registered trademark: Porvair) with a thickness of 0.45 mm being widely employed as a piercing material for ophthalmologic purposes was used in the experiment in a state where the piercing material was dampened in a uniformly maintained temperature; in the experiment the cutting performance of the bladed device was judged quantitatively from the maximum force created when a testpiece being attached to a jig was pressed upon the piercing material, had a tip thereof pierced through the piercing material, and advanced until reaching to a depth of a cutting blade portion proximal to a shank-side. That is, the cutting performance was judged from the value obtained by measuring the maximum value of pierce counterforce and incision counterforce arisen when the testpiece was pierced and advanced through the piercing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An eyeball of a swine was used for creating a state similar to ophthalmologic surgery and was pierced and incised by a same operator, so that inflexibility could be judged from the feedback felt during such procedure. Accordingly, inflexibility is to be judged qualitatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The testpieces used in the experiment were produced by combining the following angles, in which one angle (tip angle) formed by two cutting blades on both ends of the long sides of a tip-side cutting blade portion with a triangular cross-section situated proximal to a tip-side was stepped every 10 degrees between a range of 30 degrees to 110 degrees, and the other angle (blade angle) formed by two cutting blades on a shank-side cutting blade portion with a quadrangular cross-section situated proximal to a shank-side was stepped every 5 degrees between a range of 20 degrees to 30 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The results of the experiment are shown in table 1. Table 1 shows that cutting performance is greater as the blade angle and the tip angle become smaller, and poorer as the blade angle and the tip angle become larger. That is, the maximum value of the pierce counterforce and incision counterforce become larger and cutting performance becomes greater as both angles become smaller, and the maximum value of the pierce counterforce and incision counterforce become smaller and cutting performance becomes poorer as both angles become larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Since the tip becomes narrower and sharper as the blade angle and the tip angle become smaller, the tip becomes easier to flex and inflexibility would decrease.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Resulting from the experiment, a particular relation between the tip angle and blade angle has been found for demonstrating a satisfactory cutting performance (including piercing performance upon a living body tissue) as well as high inflexibility for enduring manipulation during an operation. That is, despite having a satisfactory cutting performance, inflexibility would be low and cause a risk of unsteady manipulation during an operation when the difference between the tip angle and the blade angle is smaller than 20 degrees. Therefore, the difference between the tip angle and the blade angle should preferably be 20 degrees or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows that cutting performance becomes 180 mN or more when the difference between the tip angle and the blade angle is no less than 75 degrees or no less than 80 degrees. Accordingly, considering, for example, dispersion or preferences of physicians, the difference between the tip angle and the blade angle should preferably be no more than 70 degrees when used as a medical bladed device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The foregoing medical bladed device provides satisfactory cutting performance inflexibility, and demonstrates excellent manipulability. More particularly, inflexibility is related to flexibility when piercing and cutting open a living body tissue. That is, low inflexibility signifies that a cutting blade portion is easy to flex, and high inflexibility signifies that a cutting blade portion is difficult to flex. Therefore, the strength of the medical bladed device is related to inflexibility, and the medical bladed device can demonstrate endurance for enduring repetitive numerous use by having inflexibility of a moderate degree. A satisfactory manipulability can be obtained by selecting a suitable balance between cutting performance and inflexibility.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the cross sectional shape and measurement (e.g., length) of the connection portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are determined in correspondence with the cross sectional shape of the cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the cross sectional shape of the shank portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and cannot be predetermined to a unique cross sectional shape nor measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The ridgelines of the three faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is, a back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and a pair of secondary cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are intersected to form the tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Forming the tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>in an intersected manner enables the tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be molded into a sharp pointed end having 3 ridgelines precisely matched with each other, and also serves to reduce pierce counterforce arisen during piercing of a living body tissue. It is now to be noted that the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serves as a fifth face continuing to a first face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through a fourth face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(described afterwards). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed with a prescribed length starting from the tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and has a triangular cross section. The triangular cross section is comprised of two adjacent faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>arranged therebetween and the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, in which the face form the long side of a triangle and, together with the faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>form the two cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>formed by the faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has no function of incising a targeted living body tissue, but functions to widen the living body tissue incised by the cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the back <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>does not require being shaped as a sharp edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The cutting blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed by the faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the cutting blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>formed by the faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have a function of cutting open the targeted living body tissue and forming an incision, and are therefore formed with an optimum angle for cutting open the living body tissue, respectively. However, the angle for each of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is not to be restricted in particular, and is set with an optimum angle according to the living body tissue targeted for incision. For example, the optimum angle for each of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(secondary cutting blade angle) is approximately 50 degrees to 65 degrees when the incision target is an eyeball, e.g., cornea (knife for corneal incision). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The two cutting blade <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have the tip <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serving as a peak thereof and are intersected to form an angle &bgr;, in which the intersecting angle &bgr; serves as the tip angle. The angle &bgr; is a projection angle with respect to a plane passing through a center axis of the bladed device A. More particularly, since the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is slightly inclined with respect to the center axis, the precise angle of the cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>slightly changes in correspondence to the inclined angle. Nevertheless, such change is slight, and the angle for the two cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is, the tip angle may be defined as angle &bgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In forming the tip-side cutting blade portion 4 of this embodiment, a preformed shank-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is grinded with respect to the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, the tip angle &bgr; can be set by altering the inclined angle of the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with respect to the center axis of the bladed device A. That is, the tip angle &bgr; is set by defining a blade angle &agr; formed by a pair of primary cutting blades <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>of the shank-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and also defining the inclined angle of the face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with respect to a plane which passes through the center axis of the bladed device A and includes the primary cutting blades <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The tip angle &bgr; formed by the two cutting blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a factor having a large influence on pierce counterforce arisen during forming of a primary incision to a targeted affected area of a living body tissue. As shown in the data of the foregoing experiment, the tip angle &bgr; is preferable to be small when piercing performance is only considered. However, the tip angle &bgr; is to be considered in combination with the blade angle &agr; (described afterwards) since incision counterforce arisen in an incising procedure subsequent to the forming of the primary incision and inflexibility during the incising procedure are also included in judging the cutting performance of bladed device A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The shank-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed more proximal toward the shank portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> compared to the tip-side cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in which a cross-sectional shape thereof is formed into a quadrangular shape having four faces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and four ridgelines comprised of a back <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>formed between the adjacent faces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(first face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(second face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) on a back face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B of the cutting blade portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a back <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>formed between the adjacent faces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(third face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(fourth face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) on a front face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, and the pair of primary cutting blades <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>formed between the adjacent faces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
