<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods of modulating the activity of NF-&kgr;B and to methods of inhibiting the I&kgr;B complex (IKK) using cyanoguanidine derivatives. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Neoplastic diseases are characterised by autonomous growth of cells. Neoplastic diseases may be benign, i.e. the growth is contained and does not spread to other organs or parts of the body. Neoplastic diseases may also be malignant where the growth spreads to other organs or parts of the body by infiltration or metastases. Malignant neoplastic diseases are also known as cancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Patients with neoplastic diseases are treated by surgery, ionising radiation, medication, or a combination thereof. Several types of medicaments or drugs for the treatment of neoplastic diseases are known, and one way of classifying these medicaments is suggested in Abeloff et al (Eds.), <highlight><italic>Clinical Oncology, </italic></highlight>Churchill Livingston Inc., New York, 1995, Medicaments for treatment of neoplastic diseases may conveniently by classified as chemotherapeutic agents, hormonal agents or biological response modifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chemotherapeutic agents may further be classified according to the mechanism whereby they effect their response as S-triazine derivatives such as altretamine; as enzymes such as asparaginase; as antibiotic agents such as bleomycin, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitomycin and plicamycin; as alkylating agents such as busulfan, carboplatin, carmustine, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cyclophosphamid, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, lomustine, mechlorethamine, melphalan, procarbazine and thiotepa; as antimetabolites such as cladribine, cytarabine, floxuridine, fludarabine, fluoruracil, hydroxyurea, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, pentostatin and thioguanine, and as antimitotic agents such as etoposide, paclitaxel, teniposide, vinblastine and vincristine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hormonal agents may be further classified according to the mechanism whereby they effect their response, e.g. as aromatase inhibitors such as aminoglutethimide; as antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, formestan and letrozol; and as antiandrogen such as flutamide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Biological response modifiers may be further classified according to the mechanism whereby they effect their response as e.g. lymphokines such as aldesleukin; as interferon such as interferon-&agr; and as growth factors such as erythropoietin, filgrastim and sagramostim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A number of medicaments do not fall naturally within this classification. Examples of such medicaments are anti-proliferative and/or cell differentiating agents such as all-trans retenoic acid or vitamin D analogues such as seocalcitol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other types of medicaments based on e.g monoclonal antibodies, tumour necrosis factor, gene therapy and angiogenisis inhibitors have been suggested for treatment of neoplastic diseases, but they are still in the exploratory phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, neoplastic cells are very effective in developing biochemical mechanisms that allow cellular resistance to medicaments or ionising radiation. In fact, resistance Is a common clinical problem in the therapy of neoplastic diseases &lsqb;Cun-Yu Wang, Nature Medicine, 5, 412-417, 1999&rsqb;. In order to overcome this resistance, therapy generally Involves more than one medicament or combinations of ionising radiation and medicaments. Several types of resistance are known, e.g. enhanced drug metabolism, altered drug accumulation, drug target amplification and repair of damaged targets. Resistance to apoptosis is another type of multi-drug resistance, that likely explains a significant proportion of treatment failures &lsqb;Fisher, <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>78, 539-542, 1994&rsqb;. For convenience, the terms &ldquo;medicament&rdquo; and &ldquo;drug&rdquo; are used interchangeably, and are Intended to indicate the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Clearly, there is a need for new and improved methods in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Direct manipulation of the factors controlling apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a more recently suggested approach to therapy of neoplastic diseases. Apoptosis is a genetically encoded cell death programme characterised by an &ldquo;active decision&rdquo; by the cell based on information from its environment, its own internal metabolism, its developmental history, etc to die. Unlike cells undergoing necrosis, cells stimulated to enter apoptosis are often capable of survival, but opt to die for the good of the whole organism. Apoptosis is also different from necrosis in that necrosis is often associated with traumatised tissue and cell bursts, whereas the cells condense in the course of apoptosis, and are degraded intracellularly in a controlled manner &lsqb;Tran, <highlight><italic>Science and Medicine, </italic></highlight>6, 18-27, 1999; Williams, <highlight><italic>Trends Cell Biol., </italic></highlight>2, 263-267, 1992&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> At the cellular level it is well recognised that nuclear factor &kgr;B (NF-&kgr;B) plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. It is also described that an NF-&kgr;B inhibitor, I&kgr;B, and an I&kgr;B kinase complex, IKK, control the level of activated NF&kgr;B &lsqb;Levkau, 1, 227-233, 1999; Wang, <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>274, 784-787, 196; Madrid, <highlight><italic>Molecular and Cellular Biology, </italic></highlight>5, 1626-1638, 2000&rsqb;. Accordingly, the NF-&kgr;B-I&kgr;B-IKK system has been suggested as a target in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Cusack, <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>60, 2323-2330, 2000 and Wang, <highlight><italic>Nature Medicine </italic></highlight>5, 412-417, 1999 teach that a particular chemotherapeutic, namely the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-&lsqb;4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino&rsqb;-carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11) promotes the activation of NF-&kgr;B in cells to induce resistance towards itself, and that a adenoviral transfer of an I&kgr;B, I&kgr;B&agr;, to inhibit NF&kgr;B promotes chemosensitivity to treatment with CPT-11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> WO98/37228 teaches that an agent which decreases IKK activity or that alters the association of IKK and I&kgr;B can be useful for allowing apoptosis to occur In a tumour cell by increasing the level of unphosphorylated I&kgr;B, which can bind to NF-&kgr;B and decrease the level of active NF-&kgr;B in the tumour cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Rossl, Nature, 403, 103-108, 2000 teaches that cyclopentenone prostaglandins inhibit I&kgr;B kinase, and that this makes cyclopentenone prostaglandins potentially valuable in the treatment of cancers, inflammation and viral infections. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It has surprisingly been found that a certain class of cyanoguanidine derivatives is capable of modulating the activity of I&kgr;B kinase (abbreviated IKK in the following). By modulating the activity of IKK in the cells it is possible to control the level of activated NF-&kgr;B in the cells. Such cyanoguanidines are therefore considered useful in the treatment of neoplastic diseases and other conditions believed to be affected by the level of activated NF&kgr;B, e.g. inflammation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one aspect the invention relates to a method of modulating the level of activated NF-&kgr;B in cells by contacting cells with a compound of general formula I

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;alkyl&rdquo; is intended to indicate a univalent radical derived from straight, branched or cyclic alkane by removing a hydrogen atom from any carbon atom. The term includes the subclasses primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl, tert.-butyl, isopentyl and hexyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;divalent hydrocarbon radical&rdquo; is intended to include straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated carbon chains, e.g. alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;alkoxy&rdquo; is intended to indicate a radical of formula OR&prime;, wherein R&prime; is alkyl as defined above, e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, etc. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;halogen&rdquo; is intended to indicate fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&rdquo; is intended to indicate salts prepared by reacting a compound of formula I comprising a basic group with a suitable inorganic or organic acid, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, nitric, acetic, phosphoric, lactic, maleic, phthalic, citric, propionic, benzoic, glutaric, gluconic, methanesulfonic, salicylic, succinic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, sulfamic or fumaric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reaction with a suitable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;N-oxide&rdquo; is intended to indicate e.g. pyridyl N-oxide derivatives of the compounds of the invention. Such compounds may be prepared by oxidation of the pyridyl N by a suitable oxidising agent, e.g. 3-chloro-perbenzoic acid in an inert solvent, e.g. dichlormethan. Other suitable methods to improve the physico-chemical properties and/or solubility of the compounds of the present invention, e.g. prodrugs, are known in the art, and they are also included in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;N-substituted prodrug&rdquo; is intended to indicate a cyanoguanidine compound of formula I comprising a substituent at the N atom of the pyridyl ring. The substituent is intended, i.e., to improve the solubility of compounds of formula I and is designed to be cleaved off in viva upon administration of the prodrug. Examples of such prodrugs are disclosed in co-pending International Patent Application No. PCT/DK01/00750 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; is intended to indicate a reduced sensitivity to a given treatment. Sensitivity can be defined in terms of IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>, which indicates the amount or concentration of a given treatment or ionising radiation which is lethal to 50% of the cells. An increase in IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>signifies a reduced sensitivity to a given therapy, and the cells are termed &ldquo;resistant&rdquo; if IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>increases by a factor of 10 or more, e.g by a factor of 20-50. This definition is of particular relevance for in vitro studies, but of less relevance for in vivo studies, not to mention treatment of human beings. For in vivo studies and in human therapy a more feasible definition of resistance may be expressed as the overall failure of treatment, defined as progressing neoplastic diseases in a patient who previously responded to treatment. Progressing neoplastic diseases may be defined as &gE;25% increase in the size of one or more lesions or the appearance of new lesions &lsqb;<highlight><italic>WHO Handbook for reporting results of cancer treatment, </italic></highlight>Publication No.48, Geneva, WHO, 1979&rsqb;. A compound capable of revitalising a treatment to which cells or patients are resistant is said to reduce resistance to said treatment. A compound said to reduce resistance may lower the level of IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>by a factor of 10 or more, e.g. by a factor of 20-50. Similarly, a compound said to reduce resistance to a treatment will generally restore treatment response, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Resistance to treatment of neoplastic diseases is caused by the ability of individual cells to avoid the lethal effect of the treatment. Cells capable of avoiding the lethal effect of the treatment have a proliferative advantage compared to cells sensitive to the treatment. In the course of a treatment the number of resistant cells will thus increase at the expense of the number of sensitive cells, The cells in e.g. a cancer tumour and in the same cancer tumour in a resistant state, accordingly, have different characteristics and are thus not identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;modulate&rdquo; when used in relation to levels of activated NF-&kgr;B means that the level of transcriptionally active NF-&kgr;B (rather than NF-&kgr;B that is merely translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus) is Increased or decreased compared to the level present in the absence of a compound of general formula I. The level of activated NF-&kgr;B is preferably reduced by the compound of formula I. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;down-regulation&rdquo; is intended to indicate a decrease in the expression level of a gene or a decrease in the level of activity of a gene product. Conversely, the term &ldquo;upregulation&rdquo; is intended to indicate an increase in the expression level of a gene or an increase in the level of activity of a gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;cyanoguanidine compound&rdquo; is Intended to indicate a compound comprising the structure shown in formula II

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The term comprises, but is not limited to compounds of general formula I, e.g. cyanoguanidine compounds disclosed in WO 00/61559, WO 00/61561, WO 00/76516 and WO 00/76517 are also included in this definition. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> N-(6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl)-N&prime;-cyano-N&Prime;-(4-pyridyl)guanidine, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> N-cyano-N&prime;-(9-diethylphosphionyloxynonyl)-N&Prime;-(4-pyridyl)guanidine, </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> N-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino-dodecyl)-N&prime;-cyano-N&Prime;-(4-pyridyl)guanidine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Compounds of general formula I contain asymmetric carbon atoms, ring systems as well as carbon-carbon double bonds, which allows for isomeric forms. It is understood that the present invention relates to any tautomeric, diastereomeric and optical isomeric form expressed by general formula I either in pure form or as mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> NF-&kgr;B is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors which are ubiquitous in animal cells. Rel proteins can form dimers, the most common of which is designated NF-&kgr;B, NF-&kgr;S is a p50/p65 heterodimer which can activate transcription of genes containing the appropriate &kgr;B binding site. In non-stimulated cells, NF-&kgr;B is maintained in the cytoplasm by interaction with NF-&kgr;B inhibiting proteins, the I&kgr;Bs. In response to cell stimulation by e.g. anti-neoplastic drugs or ionising radiation an I&kgr;B kinase complex (IKK) is rapidly activated and phosporylates two serine residues in the NF-&kgr;B binding domain of I&kgr;B. The phophorylated I&kgr;B is then degraded by a 26S proteasome whereas NF-&kgr;B is spared from degradation and translocates into the nucleus &lsqb;Wang, <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>274, 784-787, 1996, Cusak, <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>60, 2323-2330, 2000; Karin, <highlight><italic>Immunology, </italic></highlight>12, 2000, 85-98&rsqb;. NF-&kgr;B is thus always present in the cell, but in an inactivated form in non-stimulated cells. After translocation into the nucleus NF-&kgr;B induces inter alia the anti-apoptotic genes c-IAP1, c-IAP2, TRAF1, TRAF2, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-X<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and Mn-SOD &lsqb;Patel, <highlight><italic>Oncogene, </italic></highlight>19, 2000, 4159-41699&rsqb;, which bring about resistance in the cells to apoptosis. This effect is referred to as the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-&kgr;B, and the effect may be quantified by measuring the expression of gene products encoded by any of said genes, by any suitable means known in the art, in the presence and absence of compounds modulating the level of activated NK-&kgr;B. Any compound capable of reducing the transcription of one or more of said genes to a level of less than about 50%, e.g. less than about 30%, such as less than about 20% of the level in the absence of said compound is said to reduce the anti-apoptotic effect of NK-&kgr;B. Anti-neoplastic drugs and ionising radiation thus induce resistance in the cells to the treatments, which render them ineffective. Accordingly, activated NF-&kgr;B is a key factor in induced resistance in e.g. cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and/or to ionising radiation, This is further supported by the fact that constitutively activated NF-&kgr;B is found in cells from resistant cancer tumours &lsqb;Patel, <highlight><italic>Oncogene, </italic></highlight>19, 4159-4169, 2000&rsqb;. Regardless of reduced resistance to any treatment, a reduction of the level of activated NF-&kgr;B In the cell, e.g. by controlling the activity of IKK, will reduce the expression levels of genes encoding for anti-apoptotic factors, thereby inducing apoptosis in the cells &lsqb;Schwartz, <highlight><italic>Surgical Oncology, </italic></highlight>8, 1999, 143-153&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The role of activated NF-&kgr;B is not restricted to preventing apoptosis. NF-&kgr;B is also a critical activator of genes involved in inflammation and immunity, Activated NF-&kgr;B induces the gene coding for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which catalyses the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Furthermore, at later stages in an inflammatory episode, COX2 catalyses the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins. COX2 is also known to have anti-viral effects, which suggests that NF-&kgr;B may also be a target in the therapy of inflammatory and viral diseases &lsqb;Rossi, <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>403, 2000, 103-1081. NF-&kgr;B is also responsible for the transcriptional regulation of genes important for many other vital cellular processes. NF-&kgr;B e.g. regulates genes encoding cytokines and growth factors, adhesion molecules, acute phase reactants, receptors and chemoattractants &lsqb;Schwartz, <highlight><italic>Surgical Oncology, </italic></highlight>8, 1999, 143.153&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> I&kgr;B is non-covalently bound to NF-&kgr;B and masks its nuclear localisation signal, thereby preventing translocation into the nucleus. Various I&kgr;Bs have been identified and e.g. I&kgr;B&agr; and I&kgr;B&bgr; are expressed in most cells where they bind to p65 Rel proteins, i.e. NF-&kgr;B. Different I&kgr;B are phosphorylated by different factors allowing activation of NF-&kgr;B in response to different stimuli. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The I&kgr;B kinase complex (IKK) consist of three subunits, namely IKK&agr;, IKK&bgr; and IKK&ggr;, with a combined molecular weight of 900 kDa. IKK&agr; and IKK&bgr; both exhibit I&kgr;B kinase activity and phophorylate I&kgr;B, whereas IKK&ggr; is a regulatory subunit. IKK&agr; is 85 kDa protein and IKK&bgr; is a 87 kDa protein, and the two subunits show a large degree of homology. Whereas both IKK&agr; and IKK&bgr; are catalytically active, it has surprisingly been shown that only IKK&bgr; is essential for IKK phosphorylation of I&kgr;B. It has been found by the present inventors that compounds of general formula I are effective as inhibitors of IKK&bgr; in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, kinase profiling against about 40 different kinases has established that compounds of formula I are surprisingly selective for IKK and show little or no reactivity against the other kinases tested. This suggests a specific and unexpected effect of compounds of formula I rather than a general toxic effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described above, controlling the level of activated NF-&kgr;B by controlling the activity of IKK may be useful as therapeutic intervention in the treatment of neoplastic diseases, e.g. cancers and in particular resistant cancer forms. Controlling the activity of IKK may also be useful In the treatment of inflammatory or viral diseases. Controlling the activity of IKK may either be as a single agent therapy, or it may be part of a combination treatment with other treatments, such as one or more of the conventional anti-neoplastic treatments discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula I are known from the literature and methods of their synthesis have previously been disclosed &lsqb;EP660 823, WO 98/54141, WO 98/54143 and WO 98/54145&rsqb;. While the compounds have previously been suggested for cancer therapy, there is no indication in the literature that these compounds may be used specifically to target IKK activity and thus prevent NF-&kgr;B from exerting its anti-apoptotic effect. Likewise, it has not been suggested that compounds of formula I might be of particular use in the treatment of cancers resistant to other forms of treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention may be carried out in vivo or in vitro. For in vitro purposes, the present method may e.g. be used for screening of cyanoguanidine compounds in order to identify new cyanoguanidine compounds capable of modulating the activity of IKK or subunits thereof. Such a screening assay may comprise e.g. isolated IKK or subunits thereof exposed to cyanoguanidine compounds suspected to modulate IKK activity. Methods of obtaining isolated IKK or subunits thereof are known in the art. They comprise e.g. immunoprecipitation or expression of IKK or subunits thereof in a suitably selected host cell, e.g. as disclosed in WO98/37228. The IKK activity may conveniently be measured by determining phosphorylation of e.g. I&kgr;B, either directly or by using antibodies against phophorylated I&kgr;B. Other suitable substrates for IKK may also be used. The screening assay may also be a cellular assay in which cells expressing IKK or subunits thereof are exposed to cyanoguanidines suspected of modulating IKK activity. The cells in a cellular assay may be manipulated to enhance the expression level of IKK or subunits thereof. Methods for manipulating the expression level of proteins in cells are known in the art examples of which are genetic manipulation, classic mutation and selection. Following exposure for an appropriate amount of time, the cells may be collected, lysed, and the IKK Immunoprecipitated using an appropriate antibody. A substrate, I&kgr;B or another suitable substrate may then be added to the immunocomplex, and its ability to phosphorylate the substrate may be determined as described above, and the result compared to the result from a similar experiment performed in the absence of a cyanoguanidine compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The ability of cyanoguanidine compounds to modulate the activity of IKK or subunits thereof in a cellular assay may also be determined without disrupting the cells through lysis. After exposure of the cells to a cyanoguanidine compound for an appropriate amount of time, the secretion from the cells of e.g. specific cytokines regulated by NF-&kgr;B may be measured. Examples of such specific cytokines are tumour necrosis factor a (TNF&agr;) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The result is compared to results from similar experiments conducted in the absence of cyanoguanidine compounds. The specific compounds regulated by NF-&kgr;B and secreted by the cell may vary between different types of cells. A person skilled in the art is capable of choosing which compound or compounds will be most relevant measure for a given cell system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Regardless of how an IKK assay is run, a compound which reduces the activity of either IKK or the level of activated NF-&kgr;B to a level less than about 50%, e.g. less than about 30% or even less than about 20% of the level in the absence of said compound is said to inhibit IKK or to reduce the level of activated NK&kgr;B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present method may also be carried out in vivo, e.g. by administering an effective amount of a cyanoguanidine compound, either alone or as part of a combination treatment, to a patient in need thereof In order to modulate the level of activated NF-&kgr;B in such a patient&apos;s cells. To that end, it is preferred to administrate the compound of formula I as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation. Conveniently, the active ingredient comprises from 0.1 ppm to 100% by weight of the formulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the formulation, the active ingredient is present in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients.

Approximately 3.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells were resuspended in 1 ml transfection medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine) and incubated with 5 &mgr;g of construct DNA, 0.5 &mgr;g pRL-TK vector plus 500 &mgr;g of DEAE-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich), Addition of 10 ml of the transfection medium stopped the transfection. After having been washed with the transfection medium, the cells were resuspended in 7 ml of culture medium. The cells were then distributed into 24-well plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark), each well containing 250 &mgr;l of cell suspension (approximately 1.25&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells) and 1.25 ml culture medium, and they were incubated for 24 h before treatment.

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> EMSA: For preparation of nuclear extracts, 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells were used at each experimental point. Following treatment of the THP-1 cells with either 1 &mgr;M of compound A for 24 h and stimulation with 1 &mgr;g/ml LPS at the indicated times, the cells were washed twice in PBS, and the cells were extracted for protein. The cells were resuspended in 500 &mgr;l buffer A (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCL) with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Pefablock). Afterwards, the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, then 30 &mgr;l 10% NP 40 was added and the cells were centrifuged at 5000&times;g. Each cell pellet was then resuspended in 50 &mgr;l buffer B (buffer A with 400 mM NaCl) and vortexed, followed by incubation for 15 min at 4&deg; C. and centrifugation at 5000&times;g for 5 min at 4&deg; C. The supernatant from each cell pellet was collected and the protein concentration quantified using the BCA-200 protein assay kit from Pierce (Rockford, Ill., USA).

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Luciferase activity: LPS is one of the most potent activator of the NF-&kgr;B signaling pathway. To investigate whether compound A could modulate this effects of LPS on the activity of NF-&kgr;B, we performed a series of experiments where THP-1 cells, co-transfected with the NF-&kgr;B-dependent luciferase reporter construct and a control plasmid, were cultured for 0, 1, 2 , 4, 8, and 24 h in the presence of 1 &mgr;M of compound A. LPS was then added and the incubation continued for another 5 h. The cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was determined. All samples were made in triplicate and they were normalized with respect to transfection efficiency and expressed as percent of the activity of the DMSO-treated cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). After a pre-incubation time of 2 h, a small decrease in the NF-&kgr;B-dependent luciferase activity was observed and this decrease continued, so after a preincubation time of 24 h the NF-&kgr;B-dependent induction of luciferase expression was blocked by almost 80%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> NF-&kgr;B DNA binding activity: NF-&kgr;B has to be released from its inhibitory protein, I&kgr;B in the cytosol in order to migrate to the nucleus and activate target gene expression. To delineate the role of compound A on NF-&kgr;B translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, EMSA was carried out using nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. In unstimulated THP-1 cells treated with either DMSO (0.01%) or compound A (1 &mgr;M), the binding of the NF-&kgr;B complex was low (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 2 and 3), whereas stimulation with LPS (1 &mgr;g/ml) for 0.5 h and up to 4 h resulted In a distinct increase in the NF-&kgr;B binding activity in the DMSO-treated cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 4, 6, 8 and 10, respectively). This increase was not observed in the compound A-treated cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 5, 7, 9 and 11, respectively). After 24 h of LPS stimulation the NF-&kgr;B binding activity was slightly reduced in the DMSO-treated cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 12). A super shift experiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 15), performed with an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF-&kgr;B, identified the position of the protein-DNA complex, as did the competition experiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, lane 14). The intensity of the protein-DNA complex was quantified using a Phospholmager (available from Molecular Dynamics) and the results are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, The NF-&kgr;B DNA-binding activity of THP-1 cells treated with compound A is suppressed 2-fold compared to the control after 0.5 to 4 h of LPS-stimulation and 5-fold after 24 h of LPS-stimulation. </paragraph>

The primary antibodies (anti-I&kgr;B&agr;, anti-I&kgr;B&bgr;, anti-cdk-7; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) were diluted 1:1000. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit-HRP from DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was used in a 1:2000 dilution. The signals on the nitrocellulose membrane were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Hrsholm, Denmark). Afterwards, the same nitrocellulose membrane was stripped (100 mM &bgr;-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris pH 6.8) for 30 min. at 50&deg; C., and the nitrocellulose membrane was reprobed with anti-Cdk7 antibodies for verification of the protein loading.

In unstimulated THP-1 cells treated with either DMSO or compound A, no differences in the amount of I&kgr;B&agr; or I&kgr;B&bgr; were observed, Stimulation with LPS for 10 to 30 min. rapidly resulted in a distinct decrease of the I&kgr;B&agr; form in the DMSO-treated THP-1 cells and to a much lesser degree the I&kgr;B&bgr; form. This decrease was not observed in the compound A-treated cells, where the I&kgr;B degradation occurred at a much slower rate. However, no I&kgr;B&agr; or I&kgr;B&bgr; proteins were detected after 30 min. in either compound A- or DMSO-treated cells. The resynthesis of the I&kgr;B&apos;s was slightly faster in the DMSO-treated cells but after 120 min of LPS-stimulation, no differences were observed between the DMSO- and the compound A-treated THP-1 cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In vitro kinase assay: THP-1 cells (1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells) were stimulated with 1 &mgr;g/ml LPS for the indicated time periods and whole cell extracts were prepared as described above. IKK was immunoprecipitated with an IKK&agr;/&bgr; antibody (raised against amino acid 470-755 of IKK&bgr; of human origin but partially cross-reactive with IKK&agr; as detected by Western Blotting (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Compound A was diluted in kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50 &mgr;M ATP) at the appropriate concentrations. The compound was added to the beads for 30 min. at 30&deg; C. The kinase reaction was started by adding 2.5 &mgr;g of the GST-I&kgr;B&agr; substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) together with 2 &mgr;Ci &ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per sample. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. at 30&deg; C., and the IKK activity was measured by the amount of radioactive-labelled GST-I&kgr;B&agr; bands, quantified by the STORM860 Phospho-Imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A general problem with the kinase assay is prestimulation of the kinase. To achieve a value for the zero-point, the LPS-activated IKK mixture was incubated with 20 &mgr;M myricetin (Sigma-Aldrich), which is a known IKK&bgr; inhibitor (S. H. Tsal et al., <highlight><italic>J. Cell Biochem. </italic></highlight>74, 1999, pp. 606-615). This value was subtracted from the all other values. All data are expressed as percentage of the activity of the LPS-activated IKK&bgr; kinase treated with 0.1% DMSO. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> IKK activity: Upon cellular activation by extracellular stimuli, I&kgr;B proteins are phosphorylated by a large I&kgr;B kinase complex. An in vitro IKK activity assay was established to evaluate a possible effect of compound A on the IKK activity. The THP-1 cells were stimulated with 1 &mgr;g/ml LPS for 12 min, and then the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated by an IKK antibody. The purified IKK was then pretreated with various concentrations of compound A ranging from 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;11 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>M for 30 min. prior to the IKK activity assay (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). A &ldquo;chemical zero-point&rdquo; was introduced by treating the LPS-activated IKK with the IKK&bgr; inhibitor myricetin (20 &mgr;M) (S. H. Tsai et al., supra) to overcome the problem with a prestimulated kinase. A clear dose-response was observed as illustrated by the decrease of GST-I&kgr;B&agr; phosphorylation In the compound A-treated samples. Four independent experiments were performed and the results are summarised on the plot (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>values range from 0.9 nM to 70 nM with a mean IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value of 8 nM. </paragraph>

Strikingly, the basal level of NF-&kgr;B activity measured with the luciferase assay was very high in the PC-3 cells compared with the two other cell lines. Treatment of the HT-1080 cells and Colo-320 with TNF-&agr; increased the transcriptional activity of NF-&kgr;B after 4 and 6 h of treatment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Prolonged TNF-&agr;-treatment for up to 24 h increased the NF-&kgr;B activity to approximately 12 and 46 fold compare to the control. In contrast, when the PC-3 cells were stimulated with TNF-&agr;, only a small effect on the NF-&kgr;B activity was observed, even after long-term treatment (24 h). </paragraph>
