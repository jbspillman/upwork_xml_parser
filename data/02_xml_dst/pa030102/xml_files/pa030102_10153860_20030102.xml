<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to brake actuators, and more particularly to a brake actuator of the hand-operated type in which a hand grip is rotated to release a pawl for enabling brake releasing movement of a brake lever. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A parking brake actuating assembly is typically installed in a passenger compartment of a motor vehicle adjacent the driver&apos;s seat. The motor vehicle has a brake system that is actuated to prevent vehicle wheel rotation and hence rolling movement of the vehicle by applying tension to a vehicle brake cable that connects to the brake system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The typical parking brake actuating assembly comprises a stationary sector having a plurality of teeth. A brake lever is mounted for pivotal movement relative to the sector and is adapted to be operatively connected to the vehicle brake cable. The brake lever is pivotable in a brake applying direction to apply tension to the vehicle brake cable and in a brake releasing direction opposite the brake applying direction to release tension on the brake cable and release the vehicle brakes. A pawl is normally mounted to the brake lever for movement between engaged and disengaged positions relative to the sector teeth. When the pawl is in the engaged position and the brake lever is in the braking position, the pawl engages the teeth to prevent the brake lever from pivoting in the brake releasing direction. When pawl is in the disengaged position, the pawl disengages from the teeth to allow the brake lever to pivot from the braking position thereof towards and into the released position thereof. An elongated release member is mounted to the brake lever for longitudinal movement relative to the brake lever between normal and depressed positions. An activation button, which protrudes out of an outer end of the brake lever, is connected to an outer end of the release member. An inner end of the release member is connected to the pawl such that when the release member is moved into the depressed position, the pawl is forced into the disengaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this type of brake actuator assembly, the tension created in the brake cable system when the lever is in the brake applied position tends to force the pawl into a binding engagement with the sector teeth. To move the lever to its brake released position, the user must first lift the brake lever in the brake applying direction to remove the cable tension load from the pawl and then depresses the activation button to disengage the pawl. This is because the button is typically depressed with the user&apos;s thumb, which typically does not have enough strength to overcome the binding engagement between the pawl and the sector. Additionally, to move the lever further in the brake applying direction prior to depressing the button, the user must apply more force to the lever than was originally used to apply the brake. This can be a problem, for example, where a strong person applies the brake and then later a weaker person attempts to release the brake. It would be desirable to provide a system whereby the use of this push-button and the additional step of lifting the lever prior to releasing the brakes are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 2,248,364 discloses a twist release type hand brake actuator that eliminates the use of a push button. In the &apos;364 patent, the user rotates a hand grip on the end of the lever to disengage the pawl from the sector with which it is engaged. The hand grip has a cam structure mounted internally thereof that engages a pin. This pin is fixed on a rod that is connected to a plate that has a lug thereon. Rotation of the hand grip cams the cam structure against the pin so that the pin is forced outwardly with respect to the lever to pull the rod, which in turn pulls the plate. The plate has a lug thereon the engages the pawl to pivot it out of engagement with the sector. A spring is connected between the pawl and the plate. When the pawl is disengaged by the lug, the spring functions to bias the rod and plate back to their normal positions whereat the lug will disengage from the pawl; and upon disengagement of the lug from the pawl, the spring functions to pivot the pawl into engagement with the sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The construction disclosed in the &apos;364 patent has certain shortcomings. For example, the cam and pin mechanism that translates rotation of the hand grip into movement of the rod is mounted internally to the hand grip. This is undesirable because it increases the complexity of the grip itself, which must include suitable internal components for providing the translating action. Further, the plate and spring arrangement used to disengage and bias the pawl are relative complex and difficult to assemble, which leads to increased part and manufacturing complexity and cost. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention provides with an improved location for its translation mechanism for translating rotational movement of the hand grip to substantially linear movement of a link for releasing the pawl. The actuator comprises a mounting bracket constructed to mount the brake actuator in a passenger compartment of the motor vehicle; a sector provided on the mounting bracket and having a plurality of teeth; and a brake lever mounted for movement relative to the mounting bracket and the sector. The brake lever includes a linkage connector constructed to be connected to the brake actuating linkage. The brake lever is movable in a brake applying direction to actuate the brake actuating linkage and in a brake releasing direction opposite the brake applying direction to release the brake actuating linkage. A pawl is mounted to the brake lever for movement between engaged and disengaged positions relative to the teeth of the sector. The pawl engages the teeth of the sector to prevent the brake lever from pivoting in the brake releasing direction when in the engaged position, and in the disengaged position is disengaged from the teeth to allow the brake lever to pivot in the brake releasing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A pawl release system comprises a rotatable hand grip rotatably mounted on a free end of the lever and an elongated link extending inwardly along the lever. The link may be comprised by one or more components, but may be a singular rod. The link is connected to the pawl and movable in a shifting manner such that movement of the link in a pawl releasing direction moves the pawl from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof, thus enabling the brake lever to be moved in the brake releasing direction thereof. The link may be curved or comprised of components joined at an angle, and the shifting movement is any type of movement, such as a linear movement, that effects movement of the pawl. A translation mechanism is mounted on the lever inwardly of the hand grip and couples the hand grip to the link such that rotation of the hand grip is translated to affect movement of the link in the pawl releasing direction to move the pawl from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof. At least one spring is constructed to bias the pawl release system to normally maintain the pawl in the pawl engaged position thereof. The spring may bias the pawl directly, or may bias it indirectly via the link and/or the hand grip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On advantage of having the translation mechanism mounted on the lever inward of the hand grip, as opposed to inside the hand grip, is that the hand grip can be made smaller, saving valuable space in the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention provides an improved arrangement for providing a hand-operated brake actuator for actuating a brake actuating linkage connected to a brake system of a motor vehicle. The actuator comprises a mounting bracket constructed to mount the brake actuator in a passenger compartment of the motor vehicle; a sector provided on the mounting bracket and having a plurality of teeth; and a brake lever mounted for movement relative to the mounting bracket and the sector. The brake lever includes a linkage connector constructed to be connected to the brake actuating linkage. The brake lever is movable in a brake applying direction to actuate the brake actuating linkage and in a brake releasing direction opposite the brake applying direction. A pawl is mounted to the brake lever for movement between engaged and disengaged positions relative to the teeth of the sector. The pawl engages the teeth of the sector to prevent the brake lever from pivoting in the brake releasing direction when in the engaged position; and in the disengaged position is disengaged from the teeth to allow the brake lever to pivot in the brake releasing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A pawl release system comprises a rotatable hand grip rotatably mounted on a free end of the lever. A rigid rod extends inwardly along the lever. The rod may be curved, straight, or may be constituted by smaller rods or other substantially rigid members coupled together. The rod is connected to the pawl and movable in a substantially linear manner such that movement of the rod inwardly relative to the lever in a pawl releasing direction moves the pawl from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof, thus enabling the brake lever to be moved in the brake releasing direction thereof. A translation mechanism is mounted inwardly of the hand grip and couples the hand grip to the rod such that rotation of the hand grip is translated to affect inward movement of the rod in the pawl releasing direction to move the pawl from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof. The system also includes a pair of spring seats. One of the spring seats is a fixed spring seat, which may be provided by the lever, by one of the other components of the pawl release system, or by any other suitable structure. The other spring seat is provided on the rod. At least one spring is constructed to bias the pawl release system to normally maintain the pawl in the pawl engaged position thereof. The at least one spring includes a rod biasing spring positioned between the spring seats so as to bias the rod in the pawl releasing direction thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrate a hand-operated brake actuator, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for actuating a brake actuating linkage (not shown) connected to a brake system of a motor vehicle (not shown). The brake actuating linkage will typically be a brake cable, but may have any construction or configuration. As the present invention is primarily concerned with the componentry related to releasing the pawl the maintains the brake actuator in a brake applied position, the Figures show only the components for releasing the pawl and the remainder of the brake actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not illustrated. However, reference may be made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,286,389, 6,282,980, and 6,237,731 for examples of brake actuators with which the present invention may be used. These patents are incorporated into the present application by reference in their entirety. Of course, the present invention may be applied to any type of hand-operated brake actuator, and need not be limited to the construction disclosed herein or the constructions disclosed in these incorporated patents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a mounting bracket (not shown) constructed to mount the brake actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a passenger compartment of the motor vehicle. A stationary sector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided on the mounting bracket and has a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The sector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed integrally on the bracket, or formed as a separate component and mounted thereto. A brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is mounted for movement relative to the mounting bracket and the sector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a linkage connector (not shown) constructed to be connected to the brake actuating linkage. In a construction designed for actuating a brake cable connected to the vehicle braking system, the linkage connector would typically be provided by a slot (not shown) on a take-up reel (not shown) pivoted by the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and upon which the cable is wound during brake application. This slot receives a head provided on the end of the cable. Reference may be made to any one of the above-incorporated patents for further details in this regard. However, any suitable arrangement for directly or indirectly connecting a brake actuating linkage to the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be used. As can be appreciated, the term brake lever is being used herein to encompass not only the part that the user grabs and pivots, but also the components associated therewith that travel to actuate the brake linkage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is movable in a brake applying direction to actuate the brake actuating linkage and in a brake releasing direction opposite the brake applying direction. In the illustrated embodiment, the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivoted on the mounting bracket. A pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted to the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a point spaced from the lever&apos;s pivot. The pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> moves between engaged and disengaged positions relative to the teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the sector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In its engaged position, the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> engages the teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the sector to prevent the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from pivoting in the brake releasing direction; and in its disengaged position, the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disengaged from the teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to allow the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to pivot in the brake releasing direction. During movement of the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the brake applying direction, the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will ratchet over the teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner against the biasing of a spring, which will be discussed hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A pawl release system, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is provided to enable the vehicle user to move the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from its engaged position engaged with the sector teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to its disengaged position out of engagement with the sector teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus enabling the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be moved in a brake releasing direction from a brake applied position to a fully released position. The system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a rotatable hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on a free end of the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending inwardly along the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The hand grip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a central metal base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a molded plastic grip portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> surrounding the base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to provide a contoured grasping surface for the user. The link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and movable in a shifting manner, which is substantially linear along the axis of the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment. This enables movement of the link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a pawl releasing direction to move the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof, thus enabling the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be moved in the brake releasing direction thereof from a brake applied position. In the illustrated embodiment, the link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a rigid rod, preferably made of metal that moves inwardly relative to the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction thereof. However, in alternative constructions, the link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may have other configurations. For example, the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed to replace the rod with a bare flexible cable or a Bowden wire assembly, or the rod may be constituted by interconnected smaller rods or mechanical links coupled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The pawl release mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further comprises a translation mechanism, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, mounted inwardly of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> couples the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is translated to affect movement of the link <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction to move the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the engaged position thereof to the disengaged position thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the translation mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a first cam structure in the form of a piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with a threaded exterior surface providing a cam surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thereon. The translation mechanism also includes a second cam structure in the form of a pair of lugs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each with a cam surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> thereon. The piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> constituting the first cam structure is movable with the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the cam surfaces <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are engaged with one another such that rotation of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> creates a camming action between the cam surfaces <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to push the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction (which is to the right in the Figures). Also as illustrated, the translation mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also comprises a sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> encircling the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the lugs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are provided by pins extending radially inwardly from the sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. In place of the lugs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, an internally thread sleeve may be used to cooperate with the threads providing cam surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the piston <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, or sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> itself may be so internally threaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixedly connected to the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is also connected to the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith by an axial lost motion connection, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The lost motion connection <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided by a slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending inwardly from the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and providing a pair of slots <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extending axially with respect to the rotational axis of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pair of pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are fixed on the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extend into the slots <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> engage the pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to rotate the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> while allowing the pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to ride axially therein for permitting axial movement of the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The pins <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be provided by a single shaft penetrating a portion of the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to extend from opposing sides thereof, or may be provided by two separate pins attached on opposite sides of the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a tubular member affixed to the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but any suitable construction may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has an annular groove <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> around the periphery thereof. A grip bearing sleeve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is inserted in the free end of the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and may optionally be fixed by welding. The grip bearing sleeve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a pair of openings (not shown) formed therethrough and communicated by a groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted by inserting the slotted structure <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into the grip bearing sleeve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with the groove <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> aligned with groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. A clevis pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, or some other structure, is inserted through the openings so that it is received in the grooves <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as shown to lock the slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in place, and hence axially lock the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Because the pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is received in the groove <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can still be rotated to allow rotation of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may also be inserted through openings in the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to axially fix the slotted structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and thus the grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, on the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The pawl release mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes at least one spring constructed to bias the pawl release system to normally maintain the pawl in the pawl engaged position thereof. One or more springs may be used to bias the pawl directly, or to bias it indirectly via the rod and/or the hand grip. In the illustrated embodiment, a single coil spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a spring seat <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereon and the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides a spring seat <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> thereon. The spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes is positioned in compression between the spring seats <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so as to bias the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction thereof. The spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> encircles the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for compactness. Alternatively, the spring seat <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> could be provided by any suitable surface in the system, such as the inner end of the sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An optional blocking member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided on the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The blocking member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> engages the inner end of the grip bearing sleeve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> when the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in a position corresponding to the pawl engaged position. The blocking member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> prevents the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from moving further outwardly, which in turn prevents the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from loading further pressure on the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Also, the presence of the blocking member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> configures the actuator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can only be rotated in one direction to release the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the orientation of the cam surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is such that rotation of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a counterclockwise direction (as viewed looking directly at the free end of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) moves the piston <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction. The spring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will bias the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> back in the pawl engaging direction, which in turn causes the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to rotate back in the clockwise direction to its normal, unactivated position via the camming action provided by the cam surfaces <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This arrangement is suited particularly for vehicles wherein the driver is seated on the left hand side of the vehicle, as the user&apos;s right hand is used in a better leveraged and more natural motion to rotate the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Of course, the orientation of the cam surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be reversed for vehicles wherein the driver is seated on the right side of the vehicle, as is the case in England. These particular orientations are not intended to be limiting and instead are provided to note features of the particular embodiment illustrated. Likewise, the translation mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be configured such that rotation of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in either direction moves the rod <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the pawl releasing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pitch of the cam surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also be varied to achieve different levels of mechanical advantage. Also, the diameter of the hand grip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may likewise be varied to achieve different levels of mechanical advantage. The total amount of mechanical advantage provided should be enough to overcome the binding engagement of the pawl <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the sector teeth <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without having to lift the lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The foregoing illustrated embodiment has been provided solely to illustrate the structural and functional principles of the present invention and is not intended to be limiting. To the contrary, the present invention is intended to encompass all changes, modifications, substitutions, and alterations encompassed within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
