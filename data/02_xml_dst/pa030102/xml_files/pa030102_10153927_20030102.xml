<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A suture anchor includes a body having a distal end and a proximal end. Projections in the form of ribs or threads are formed on the body for retaining the anchor in a hole formed in bone. An eyelet formed on the distal end of the body accepts suture. The eyelet preferably is formed by a loop of suture. Where the body of the anchor is formed of a polymer, the suture loop can be formed by insert-molding the suture into the body. Tissue is reattached to bone using the suture anchor by securing a length of suture to the tissue, and threading the length of suture through the eyelet on the distal end of the anchor, leaving lengths of suture extending from either side of the eyelet. Installing the suture anchor into the bone wedges the lengths of suture between the suture anchor and the bone, thereby securing the tissue without the need for tying knots. Pullout strength can be enhanced by twisting the lengths of suture prior to installation of the anchor into the bone. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to devices and methods for securing soft tissue to bone, and more particularly, to suture anchors for proximating tissue to bone using knotless interference fixation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When soft tissue such as a ligament or a tendon becomes detached from a bone, surgery may be indicated to reattach or reconstruct the tissue. Various fixation devices, including sutures, screws, staples, wedges, and plugs have been used in the past to secure soft tissue to bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More recently, various types of suture anchors have been developed. The suture anchors are implanted in bone, and suture passed through the soft tissue is secured to the suture anchor. The technique usually requires the surgeon to tie knots in the suture, which is tedious and time-consuming, particularly in an arthroscopic procedure. Surgical procedures would be less cumbersome for the surgeon and ultimately more beneficial to the patient if the tissue could be attached to the bone without the surgeon having to tie suture knots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0013608 A1, dated Jan. 31, 2002, of common assignment with the present application and incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of graft fixation using an interference screw. Suture is attached to the graft and inserted into a pre-drilled hole. The interference screw is driven into the pre-drilled hole to secure the suture. The procedure would be simpler if the tissue could be transported toward the suture anchor more directly, and the step of inserting the suture into the pre-drilled hole could be eliminated. Enhancement of the pull-out strength of the construct also is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Insert molded suture anchors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,783 issued on Oct. 12, 1999 to Grafton et al., of common assignment with this application and incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a suture anchor construct that does not require knots. The construct includes a ribbed or threaded suture anchor having a suture eyelet provided on a distal end of the anchor. Lengths of repair suture that have been passed through soft tissue are threaded through the eyelet and inserted simultaneously with the anchor into a preformed hole. Advantageously, a flexible eyelet can be formed in a polymeric suture anchor by insert-molding a looped length of suture within the suture anchor such that a closed portion of the suture loop extends from the distal end of the anchor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The anchor of the present invention is used for tissue repair involving reattachment of soft tissue to bone. A hole for the suture anchor is preformed in bone. Installing the anchor and suture into the bone hole opposes the tissue to the bone. The suture is held in the preformed hole by an interference fit. The interference fit is established by a wedge effect on the suture between the suture anchor and the walls of the bone socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Pull out strength of the construct can be increased by various methods. The interference fit can be enhanced, for example, by forming twists in the limbs of at least a portion of the suture that passes alongside the installed suture anchor body within the preformed hole. Twisting the suture increases a cable friction effect (friction between the twisted lengths of suture) and also increases the wedge effect. The wedge effect similarly will be enhanced by forming knots in the suture, or utilizing suture formed with irregular thicknesses. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,783, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention which refers to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> suture anchor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown. Suture anchor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes an anchor body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a section of suture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forming a loop inside the suture anchor body. Anchor body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a tapered distal end <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a proximal end with a drive head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed to complement a suture anchor driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The anchor body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with multiple, circumferential ribs <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to enhance pull-out strength of the anchor from bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Suture section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed into distal loop <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and an optional additional proximal loop <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by overlapping or abutting two ends of the suture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and insert molding the suture while forming anchor body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The overlapping ends of suture can be twisted around each other or provided with knots, for example, to enhance pull-out strength of the suture from the anchor body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> optionally can be formed on one side of the anchor body to provide a clearance for tissue suture passing back along the side of the anchor, as described in more detail below. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, drive head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided in a complementary hexagonal configuration to engage driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a method of attaching tissue <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to bone <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown schematically. A hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preformed in bone <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as the glenoid rim. A length of suture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is inserted through tissue <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and through distal loop <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of anchor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> engages drive head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Driver <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cannulated at least partially to accommodate proximal suture loop <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, suture anchor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven into hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, drawing tissue suture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in to oppose tissue <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the bone surface adjacent the opening of bone hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Prior to driving the suture, the tissue has been pulled toward the tissue anchor, preferably to a distance approximately one anchor length from the tip of the anchor. The tissue suture passes back out of the hole by way of the relief provided by flat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the side of anchor body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, an anchor without a flat can be provided for stronger interference fixation as a result of the tissue suture being wedged more firmly between the wall of the bone hole and the body of the anchor. Proximal suture loop <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remains proud for further suturing needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, alternative steps in the method of attaching tissue are illustrated. A hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pre-formed in bone <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is produced with a keyway punch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to form offset channel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which accommodates a nest of twisted suture, as described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> length of suture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is inserted or looped through tissue <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and through distal loop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> optionally can differ from anchor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above by having, for example, only a single, distal eyelet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Legs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>of suture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are twisted together either by hand or by threading the legs into spinning a twisting tool <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having diagonal openings in which suture legs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are received. Twisting the suture legs creates a suture &ldquo;nest&rdquo; <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is received in channel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and becomes wedged by anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is impacted to install anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> such that nest <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is received in offset channel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As suture anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is driven into hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, suture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> draws tissue <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> toward bone hole <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the length of suture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> remaining between eyelet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and edge of tissue <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having been adjusted to equal the length of anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> prior to insertion. Suture twisting tool <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be combined with the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is shown fully seated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, with suture nest <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> installed in channel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed away from tissue <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, suture nest <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be in a channel formed adjacent the tissue. According to a further alternative method step, suture nest <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be formed by twisting the anchor, rather than twising the suture with a separate tool. Traction suture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> optionally can be attached to anchor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to hold the anchor on the end of driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As a further option, the anchor can be threaded, and installed by rotating the anchor with the suture through the distal eyelet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
