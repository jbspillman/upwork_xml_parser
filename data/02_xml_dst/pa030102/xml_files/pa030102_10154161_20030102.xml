<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) this application claims priority from Korean application no. 2001-28727, filed May 24, 2001 and Korean application no. 2001-45165, filed on Jul. 26, 2001. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hinge assembly for a door of a kimchi storage device, and more particularly, to a hinge assembly for a door of a kimchi storage device, which prevents the door from coming off the upper surface of the body by maintaining the closed position without fail upon closure of the door and which prevents cold air from leaking by maintaining a sealed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is generally known, kimchi storage devices exclusively used for kimchi, which mature and preserve kimchi optimally by using the principles of a refrigeration are now commonly used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The kimchi storage device is constituted in such a manner that it can mature kimchi adequately according to seasonal variation and a user&apos;s taste and then preserve the taste of the well-matured kimchi for a long time at a proper temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While a general refrigerator is designed to have a door which opens and closes laterally, it is common that such a kimchi storage device is provided with an upper open/closed type door having a small overall size which is hingeably fixed to the upper surface of the body and is moved longitudinally into and out of the open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As illustrated therein, two separate kimchi storage chambers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided in the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the kimchi storage device which forms the appearance. Two doors <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are hinged to the upper end of the rear surface of the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in order to open and close these two kimchi storage chambers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by lifting them upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> All operations of the kimchi storage device are performed with a control panel <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided on the front surface of the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> hinge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is employed for a conventional kimchi storage device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, comprises a turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed to a door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> side, a hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forming a compartment in a case shape, a roller-shaped press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> disposed at one end of the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a hexahedral support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a pair of spring members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, both being placed in the compartment of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a support plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, an adjust plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a cover plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> fixed to a body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the kimchi storage device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are rotatably connected by a hinge shaft <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and an open internal region of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is covered by the cover plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the upper surface thereof to enable a sliding motion by rolling contact with the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and two spring coupling recesses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on the lower surface thereof for receiving the pair of spring members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which are below the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> At this time, it is preferable that a buffer member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> made of sponge material be inserted between the springs members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the cover plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for preventing direct frictional contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of a partial portion of a kimchi storage device employing a hinge assembly in the conventional art. The turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed and mounted to the rear surface of the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by a screw assembly. The hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is fixed and mounted on the upper end of the rear surface of the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a screw assembly through the cover plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which covers an open surface of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with an engagement means such as fixing protrudes of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and fixing holes of the cover plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In this way, in the state that the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the hinge assembly are assembled, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed to the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned over backwardly and moved when opening the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully open, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned over at an angle of up to <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees with respect to the upper end of the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At this time, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is slidably moved while the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is in rolling contact with the slopping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having a slopping shape formed at the top surface of the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is brought to the fully open position, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is in contact with the low contact surface <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and gradually slides onto the high contact surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is closed. Due to the sloping shape of the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> presses the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> downwardly and thus the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contacted with the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is compressed by pressing force from the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comes closer to the closed position, the pressing force applied to the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> becomes larger and accordingly the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also becomes larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is closed, the resistance force caused by the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> becomes larger. By the time the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the closing speed of the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sharply decreased to thus reduce the closing impact of the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, in a case of the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employed for the kimchi storage device in the conventional art, the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> formed at the top surface of the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is simply configured to have a predetermined slope angle in the same direction between the low contact surface <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the high contact surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is completely closed, the resistance force caused by the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is maximized thereby causing the upward pushing force on the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Hence, when the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is in the fully closed position, the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> pushes the support member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> upwardly and thus the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> contacting the high contact surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the sloping contact surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> returns to the low contact surface <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, though slightly. This generates an inadequate gap as the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comes off from the upper surface of the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thereby allowing a cold air to leak out from the kimchi storage chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the gap between the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the kimchi storage device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is opened, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed to the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned over backwardly on a hinge shaft <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with respect to the fixed hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At this time, there may occur an incidental accident such as a pinching of a user&apos;s fingers in the gap of a joint portion between the lower end portion of the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the upper end portion of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the magnitude of the gap varying according to the opening and closing angles of the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus, at an area where the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>meet, there is formed an edge portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of an angular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have a length ratio of 3:1 with respect to a horizontal line on the upper face of the support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At the hinge assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, a guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is formed at an upper end portion of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The guard portion having an inwardly curved shape is extended from the upper end of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> toward inside of the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to cover a gap formed in a conjunction area between the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has two lateral faces and a backward face having the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. At the front end of both lateral faces is formed a protuberance having a shaft hole <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for coupling the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the hinge shaft <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is formed by an extension of the upper end portion of the backward face of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has an inwardly curved shape so that it can extend toward the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and be placed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At this time, the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has such a shape and degree of curving that it cannot contact the hinge shaft <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> within the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The operation and effects of the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are side cross-sectional views showing the operating state of a door of a kimchi storage device employing the hinge assembly according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the construction of the support member of the present invention, on the upper surface of the support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are formed the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a upwardly sloping shape and the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a downwardly sloping shape next to the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The thusly constructed support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> contains parts of one end of a spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a springback force and is placed in the compartment of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> On the upper surface of the support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> consisting of the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comes into contact with a roller-shaped press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being coupled to the front end of the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In such a construction, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully opened, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the front portion of the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Also, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, as the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is closed, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is slidably moved along the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the upwardly sloping shape. Due to the sloping shape, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> presses the support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> downwardly and thus the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connected with the support member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is compressed by the pressing force from the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comes closer to the closed position, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reaches closer to the edge portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>along the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. At this time, the compression force reserved in the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> becomes larger and accordingly the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> becomes larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fully closed, the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> goes over the edge portion<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>into the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and away from the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At this time, since the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is of a downwardly sloping shape, the compression force on the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> becomes alleviated and accordingly the springback force of the spring member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also becomes alleviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The edge portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which is formed at the area where the first and second contact surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>meet, prevents the press roll <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the second contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from returning to the first contact surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without an external force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the edge portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>serves an important role in maintaining the closed position of the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the guard portion<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of an inwardly curved shape, being extended from the upper end of the backward face of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> toward inside of the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is placed therein, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed to the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned over backwardly when a user lifts the door <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> upwardly in order to open a storage chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At this time, the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> formed at the front end of the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> goes into the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and covers the gap formed in the conjunction area between the hinge housing <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus preventing incidental accident such as the pinching of the user&apos;s finger. Also, because the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is in a curved shape, the turn member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can turn around without interfering with the guard portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the construction of the support member of the hinge assembly for the door of the kimchi storage device of the present invention, the closing speed of the door is alleviated by the springback force of the spring upon closure of the door, thus preventing the closing impact of the door. Also, when the door is closed by the second contact surface, formed at the rear portion of the upper surface of the support member, the closed position can be maintained without fail, thus preventing the door from coming off the upper surface of the body and preventing cold air leakage by maintaining a sealed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by covering the gap formed in the conjunction area between the hinge housing and the turn member with the guard portion formed at the upper end of the hinge housing covers, incidental accident such as a pinching of the user&apos;s finger can be prevented during opening and closing of the door, thus enabling safe opening and closing operations. </paragraph>
