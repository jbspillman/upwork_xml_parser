<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a manufacturing method for a semiconductor apparatus, and in detail, the present invention particularly relates to such a manufacturing method for a semiconductor apparatus, wherein a micro wiring pattern is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the miniaturization of a wiring pattern has been quickly advanced in order to improve the degree of integration and the property of an LSI. The techniques for miniaturizing a gate length in order to improve the property of a transistor and for opening a contact hole smaller than that of a conventional contact hole in order to improve the degree of integration have been strongly requested. It is well known that a limit resolution (R) in an optical lithography process to determine the minimum size of the LSI is represented by the following equation (1): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>R&equals;k&times;&lgr;/NA</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this case, &lgr; is a wave-length of a light source, NA is the numerical aperture in a projection lens, and k is a constant having a value of about 0.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> That is, in order to attain the lithography process having a resolution higher than that of the conventional one, it is desirable to select a light source having a shorter wave-length. Because of this reason, a photolithography machine, which uses a krypton fluorine (KrF) excimer laser having a wave-length of 248 nm as a light source, is used in a field of manufacturing an high technology device. However, NA of a current exposing apparatus is 0.68 at its maximum. Thus, even the latest KrF excimer laser photolithography machine has only a resolution of about 0.18 &mgr;m. However, the resolution derived from the equation (1) is applied to a banded pattern typically referred to as a line and space. Then, the resolution of the contact hole pattern has a limit of about 0.22 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a technique for opening a micro contact hole having a diameter of 0.15 &mgr;m is requested in a device of 0.13 &mgr;m generation. This is the size that can not be easily attained even by using an argon fluorine (ArF) excimer laser photolithography machine, which is expected as a next generation photolithography machine using a light source having a wave length of 193 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As one method of solving this problem, a technique for carrying out an etching process so as to give a taper to a side wall of a hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> formed on a film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to be processed by using a resist mask <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is known and thereby finishing it to a desired hole diameter at a bottom <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the above-mentioned conventional method, even if a desired hole diameter (a hole diameter on design) Db is obtained at the bottom <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a diameter Dt at an upper end (aperture) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>of the hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> becomes greater than the desired size (a size on the design). This results in a problem that a sufficient matching margin can not be obtained at a later lithography process. For example, this has a problem that a distance d from a wiring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>I placed adjacently to the hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made narrower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a manufacturing method for a semiconductor apparatus proposed in order to solve the above-mentioned problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing method of a semiconductor apparatus of the present invention includes the steps of: forming a mask material film made of organic insulation film on a film to be processed; forming a tapered opening pattern or aperture pattern, in which a bottom is narrower than an open side on the mask material film; and etching the film to be processed using the mask material film as a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the manufacturing method of the semiconductor apparatus, after the mask material film is formed on the film to be processed, the tapered aperture pattern that is narrower at the bottom side than at the aperture side is formed on the film to be processed, and thereby it is possible to able to form the bottom of the aperture pattern at the desired micro dimension exceeding the limit of the lithography technology. The film to be processed is then etched by applying thus-processed mask material film as a mask, thereby, the film to be processed can be vertically etched to the micro dimension exceeding the limit of the lithography technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the manufacturing method of the semiconductor apparatus of the present invention, after the mask material film is formed on the film to be processed, the tapered aperture pattern in which the bottom is narrower than the aperture side is formed on this mask material film. Thus, the bottom of the aperture pattern can be formed at the desirable micro dimension exceeding the limit of the lithography technique. The thus-processed mask material film is used as the mask, and the film to be processed is etched. Hence, the film to be processed can be vertically etched to the micro dimension exceeding the limit of the lithography technique. Therefore, since the film to be processed can be processed under the excellently controlling performance with regard to the size, the matching margin is never decreased differently from the conventional direct taper etching method.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a manufacturing method for a semiconductor apparatus according to the present invention will be described below with reference to a sectional view of manufacturing steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed made of, for example, silicon oxide film is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Next, a first mask material film (mask material film) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of an organic insulation film is formed on the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed. A dielectric film having low dielectric constant is used as this organic insulation film. The material referred to as the low dielectric film is the material having a lower dielectric constant than that of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and is originally developed in order to reduce an inter-wiring capacitance of an LSI. For example, FLARE made by Honeywell Co., Ltd., SILK made by Dow Chemical Ltd. and the like are known as such material. Those organic system materials have a high heatproof temperature of 350&deg; C. Thus, they can be positively used even as a hard mask material in a process for manufacturing a semiconductor. Hence, they can be used to form a micro hole pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which serves as an etching mask to this first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is made of, for example, an oxide film, is formed on the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed on the second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of, for example, a silicon oxide film. With regard to this silicon oxide film, if it is the silicon oxide film serving as the etching mask to the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film formed by a chemical vapor deposition, a silicon oxide film of a coating type such as SOG film and the like can be used, and accordingly the film forming method is not specified. As mentioned above, the low dielectric film has the high heatproof property although it is the organic film. Thus, it can be sufficiently endured in the process for forming the mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of the oxide film by using the chemical vapor deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the usual lithography process is carried out under this condition, and an aperture pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the formable pattern size at this time is limited by the limit resolution of the lithography technique. If the defect of the lithography process causes a line width and a positional deviation to depart from a range of a specification, it is possible to apply a reproducing process through a usual resist ashing. Even if a resist reproducing process is carried out, the second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the low dielectric film. Thus, the low dielectric film is protected by this second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Hence, the low dielectric film is never ashed in carrying out the reproducing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the lithography process is completed without any trouble, the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on which the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed is used as the mask, and the second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is etched to thereby form an aperture pattern <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used as the etching mask, and the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of the low dielectric film is etched. This etching is done such that in an open pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed on the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a bottom side is narrower than an aperture side, and its side-wall becomes taper-shaped. Actually, the taper etching can be carried out by setting a temperature of the substrate to a low temperature (for example, &minus;50&deg; C. to 0&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Usually, the deposition reaction and the etching reaction are mixed in an etching chamber. The deposition reaction is easily carried out by lowering the temperature of the substrate. Thus, it is possible to process the taper shape. Ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), mixed gas of hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) and nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), oxygen (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and the like are used as the etching gas for the low dielectric film. In addition, a method of etching the organic insulation film to the taper shape in an excellently controlling manner is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. H7-27886. According to this method, an aperture having a desirable taper angle can be formed, for example, by changing a content of phloro-carbon gas in the etching gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned etching process, when the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is etched, the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is also etched and removed. Then, when the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is perfectly removed, the second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> serves as the etching mask, and the etching is further advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is used as the etching mask, and the usual etching for the vertical processing is carried out. Consequently, an aperture pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which is further miniaturized over the size formed by the lithography process, is formed on the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed. In the etching at this time, the second mask material film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> &lsqb;refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C&rsqb; formed on the upper layer is desired to be formed in advance at a film thickness to be etched simultaneously with the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>E, the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of the low dielectric film that is already unnecessary &lsqb;refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D&rsqb; is removed by carrying out the ashing process similar to the resist removal. As a result, the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> less than the resolution limit of the lithography technique can be formed on the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As compared with the method of reducing the hole diameter (or the slit width) at the bottom by performing the taper etching on the film itself to be processed that is typically used, the method of the present invention can carry out the vertical processing of the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed. Thus, for example, when the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is the hole pattern, its control of the hole diameter thereof becomes easy. The problem of the lack of the matching margin as described in the problem is never induced. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed has a step S, the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can function as a flattened layer. Thus, this method has the merit that the lithography step is advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the above-mentioned manufacturing method is used to form the contact hole pattern, as the example, the lithography process is carried out to thereby form the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> composed of the contact hole pattern having the diameter of 0.22 &mgr;m on the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Then, for the first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> made of the low dielectric film, the taper etching is used to finally obtain the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having the bottom diameter of 0.15 &mgr;m. When this first mask material film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is used as the etching mask and the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed is vertically etched, the aperture pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having a diameter of 0.15 &mgr;m is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A KrF excimer laser exposing apparatus (an exposure wave length&equals;248 nm) in which NA&equals;0.68 and &sgr;&equals;0.75 is used as the optical condition to expose the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As the resist film, for example, R11JE made by JSR Corporation is used, and its film thickness is defined as 0.4 &mgr;m. Also, a parallel flat plate type of a plasma etching apparatus is used to etch the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be processed, and ammonium (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is used for the etching gas, and the temperature of the substrate is set to 0&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the case in which the optical lithography is carried out to thereby form the micro contact hole pattern is exemplified. However, the present invention can be also applied to an electron beam lithography, an ion beam lithography and an X-ray lithography. Moreover, it can be applied not only to the contact hole but also the formation of the micro slit pattern. </paragraph>
