<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A pixel-based Spatial Light Modulator (&ldquo;SLM&rdquo;) can be used to modulate an incoming light signal. SLMs can be used in many contexts, such as in projection displays, printing, telecommunications, and in other types of light processing. In a telecommunications context, an incoming light signal can have multiple different channels or carrier wavelengths. In these contexts, differing patterns of pixels are used to achieve differing desired performance characteristics of the modulated light signal. A challenge, however, is to determine the pixel patterns, from all the possible pixel patterns, to be used to achieve the desired optical performance characteristics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This application describes embodiments for determining pixel patterns to be used or applied in a pixel-based SLM to achieve certain optical response characteristics. This application further describes embodiments for tuning the optical response characteristics of SLMs and sub-arrays of pixels in SLMs. One optical response being characterized in the embodiments described in this application is that of optical attenuation, but other optical response characteristics also may be accommodated. For example, pixel patterns could also be chosen for their phase effects on the incoming optical signal or on the patterns&apos; abilities to spatially separate or switch incoming optical signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one approach, the optical response of each individual pixel within certain segments of the SLM is determined. Using that information, it can be determined which pixels can be added together to generate a desired composite response to an incoming light signal. The SLM may contain a number of segments or sub-arrays which can be assigned to certain channels or wavelengths (or ranges of channels or wavelengths) of an incoming light signal having multiple such channels or wavelengths, and these segments can all be characterized such that appropriate patterns for each segment can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In determining patterns to be used to modulate the separate channels or wavelengths of an incoming light signal by segments of the SLM, the patterns may be distinct, aperiodic patterns, or patterns may be periodic patterns to be applied across some or all of segments (or parts of the segments). In either case, the optical response of the segments having these patterns can be tuned by turning on or off certain pixels. Predetermined or calculated sequences can be provided for the toggling of these pixels, making use of the fact that certain pixels within a segment may be known to have a larger or more coarse influence on modulated, light signals, whereas others will have a smaller or finer response on the light signals. Knowledge of the characteristics of the pixels and/or periodic pixel patterns will enable generation of segment pixel patterns without applying a &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; method of trying every single pattern within a segment in order to find certain optical response characteristics. In other words, it is possible to reduce the analysis for determining light patterns to a smaller subset of patterns out of all possible patterns within a segment.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the components of an optical signal processing system in which the embodiments described in this patent application can be used. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an input light collimator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which receives an optical light signal input on optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. From the input <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a free-space optical signal enters the system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The optical signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can have from 1 to N channels, each of which may be a separate wavelength &ldquo;&lgr;&rdquo; (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>. . . &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>). Free-space optical signal 104 is directed towards a grating 106, which will spatially separate the optical channels slightly so that they will travel along slightly diverging optical paths. These diverging optical paths then pass through an imaging lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which purpose is to focus the optical signals on to the DMD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The path between the lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may contain a mirror 110 for reflecting the signal back generally towards the direction from which it came. Provided next to the DMD is a correction lens <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which can be used to adjust for situations where the grating is not at the first focal point of the imaging lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In other words, the correction lens allows the path length from the grating <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the imaging lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to be different from the focal length of the lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Folding mirror <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is provided to direct the light signals onto the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Because of the separation of channels provided by the grating <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, each channel will fall on a slightly different portion of the DMD surface. The DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will reflect the light beam back towards the mirror <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, but the mirrors of the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will modulate the incoming light signal such that the DMD acts as an optical signal processor. This optical signal processing could be, for example, optical attenuation, wavelength filtering, optical performance monitoring, co-channel modulation, or dispersion compensation. In systems employing multiple ports, the optical signal processor can be employed as an add/drop multiplexer. Another purpose for the optical signal processing performed by the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> could be to provide a programmable optical source, such can be formed from a wide-band optical laser whose input is filtered down to make it appear as if it were one or more sources of narrow-band light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, after reflection from the DMD surface and the mirror <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the light signals return along a return path <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through mirror <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and imaging lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Although this path is similar to the path for the incoming light beam <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, it is slightly spatially separated, such that when the beam strikes the grating <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> again on the return path, it is spatially offset from the position where it struck the grating <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as the incoming path <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The optical grating <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereupon re-converges the multiple channels, and directs them towards a mirror <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, which is also separated from the incoming beam <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, but is in line with the return beam <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. From the mirror <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the reflected light beam <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is directed towards an output of the system, which is preferably also a collimator 120. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The structure of the optical system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is just an example of an optical system in which the embodiments discussed in this application can be applied. For example, in the application shown in the figure, the incoming light signal is reflected from the DMD in a manner such that the reflected light signal does not travel along the same path as the incoming light signal. In some applications, it may be desirable to direct the reflected beam back along the same path and use a circulator to separate the incoming and outgoing beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a top view of the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and on the surface of the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are a plurality of individual pixel elements <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. These individual pixel elements are, in one embodiment, individual DMD mirrors, which can be individually switched on and off by circuitry underlying the DMD pixels on a semiconductor substrate. In such an embodiment, the array may be a 768&times;10<highlight><superscript>24 </superscript></highlight>array, although many other array dimensions could be used. Besides DMD-type spatial light modulators, the principles employed here could also be applied to liquid crystal displays or other types of spatial light modulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also shown on the surface of the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are a number of segments or sub-arrays <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of pixels. The segments represent divisions of the area in which the multiple channels of the incoming free-space optical signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can strike the surface of the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In this description of the embodiments, the area in which the plurality of channels of the optical signal strike the DMD will be referred to as the band <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, whereas the sub-arrays in which the channels strike are referred to as segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Thus, as shown here, there would be a segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> devoted to receiving a first channel, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, a second channel &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, a third channel &lgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and so on, up until an nth channel &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. Within each segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in general the intensity distribution will be Gaussian in shape due to the mode of the single-mode fiber. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows each individual channel as being contained within a single band <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and striking within a single segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to have the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>area, which is the area containing 91% of the power, of the incoming channel signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> striking over multiple segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. This flexibility is made possible because this is an optical signal processing application, and therefore the system can be programmed to handle the division of optical wavelengths among one or multiple segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows an application in which the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>distribution of the particular wavelength channel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the optical signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is distributed across three segments, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Rather than distributing the channel <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> over three segments, the channel signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> applied onto a signal segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, or onto two, three, four or any other number of segments, according to the way in which the system is programmed to process the incoming optical light signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Once the different optical channels have been distributed across the multiple segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the band <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, signal processing is applied to operate the spatial light modulator elements controlling those different segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. One challenge is determining which pixels to turn on or off to achieve the signal processing results that are desired. Since a given segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may have any number of pixels, and since the number of combinations of different pixels rises exponentially as the number of elements increases, a brute-force method for determining the different arrays of the pixels elements can quickly overwhelm a system for determining the patterns to be used to achieve the signal processing results. Described in this application is a system and method for more efficiently determining patterns to be applied to the pixels of the different segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in order to achieve the goals for signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment in which a periodic pattern <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is applied across the segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in order to provide the desired optical signal processing. For example, a certain periodic pattern <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can be applied across a 2&times;3 subset of pixel pairs or base units <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> within the segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and this pattern <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can be repeated for each 2&times;3 group of pixel pairs <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> across the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, within a 12&times;12 array of pixels, limiting the periodicity to 2&times;3 pixel-pair patterns will result in approximately 4500 unique periodic patterns needing to be generated and applied to the segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Thus, rather than the 1043 of unique patterns that may be found in a complete 12&times;12 pattern, by using the periodicity, the number of unique patterns which must be generated is greatly reduced. The process of generating the patterns to be applied to achieve the signal processing objectives is therefore greatly simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows an exemplary pattern <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> that may be applied and repeated through out the segments <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, such as to the segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. In this example, the &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are shown by the light-colored pixels, whereas the &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are darkly shaded. A number of different patterns can be applied and repeated across the segments <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in order to achieve different optical performance characteristics. These base units were chosen, in part, so that the two directions of periodicity would be orthogonal and parallel respectively to the dispersion direction across the DMD. The simplest base unit is a single pixel with an &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> there are shown six base units <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> arranged in a 2&times;3 grouping <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. While the base units <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are shown having two pixels 202 each, it would also be possible to have base units of one, three, four, five, or other multiples. Any n&times;m set of pixels, where n and m are positive integers, can be chosen as a base unit. Further, it is possible for the group <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to be comprised of two, three, four, five or any other number of base units <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Again, any n&times;m set of base units, where n and m are positive integers, can be chosen as group or &ldquo;tile.&rdquo; So that the optical performance is reasonably insensitive to alignment, the tile size is designed in these embodiments to be much smaller in both orthogonal directions than the spot size. As an example, the tile size may be designed to be approximately 20% or less of the spot width in the corresponding dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> provides an example of a segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in which a non-periodic set of pixel patterns is applied to modulate the incoming light signal. In this example, there are provided 7 columns and nineteen rows, and in which the rows alternate between 6 and 7 pixels each. In other words, row 1 has 7 pixels, row 2 has 6 pixels placed above and between adjacent pixels of the first row, row 3 has 7 pixels above and spaced on either side of the pixels of row 2, and so on. This arrangement of pixels for the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> is merely exemplary. Other arrangements of pixels having different numbers of rows or different numbers of columns could be used, and is further possible to have an arrangement of pixels in which each row would have the same number of pixels. Provided in Appendix I are a set of aperiodic patterns that has been adapted to this group of pixels and which are designed to provide a range of desired optical responses. This is an example of the adaptation of pixel patterns to effect desired optical performance characteristics, and many patterns could be applied to many SLM pixel arrays or sub-arrays in accordance with the methods and systems described in this application. Further, the effects of both periodic and non-period pixel patterns can be combined in a given pixel pattern. A periodic pixel pattern can be given non-periodic variations interspersed within it to tune the optical performance characteristics. Alternatively, there can be certain areas within a pixel pattern that have periodically repeating patterns and other certain areas within a pixel pattern that have non-periodic patterns. These combination periodic/non-periodic pixel patterns can be defined as starting pixel patterns, or they can be generated as a part of the pixel pattern fine-tuning process described in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Whether periodic or non-periodic pixel patterns are used within the segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will depend on the performance characteristics and advantages hoped to achieve through the particular pattern selected. Non-periodic (spot-related) patterns slowly diffuse energy in to the Fraunhover envelope halo that results from the finite extent of the aperture. Periodic patterns instead make more orders available to allow energy to be diverted. If the pattern period is reasonably small compared to the size of the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>spot, then the approximate attenuation level becomes less sensitive to alignment. Currently, that means restricting the period to about 2 pixels in any direction. This is based on the current optical design of the beam spot area that is directed on to a given segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and on current process technology. Thus, through advances in process technology and system design, it may be possible to have a periodic pattern of greater than two. Above, the term &ldquo;aperture&rdquo; was used. A traditional &ldquo;aperture&rdquo; blocks energy equally from about the perimeter of an opening, whereas the digital aperture referred to herein, due to its digital nature, allows for the possibility of picking the points within the opening at which energy becomes blocked. In other words, in a traditional circular aperture to reduce the size of the aperture requires a gradual reduction of the opening about the entire circumference. In a digital aperture, however, such as provided by the pixels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, it is possible to selectively remove individual mirrors from those that are providing the transmitted or reflected light, thereby providing greater flexibility in how the aperture is defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The concept of a traditional vs. a digital aperture is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, for example, shows a traditional aperture <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which defines an opening <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> that can be adjusted as shown by the arrows <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In other words, the opening <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is set to be closer or farther from the outer circumference. In this way, the opening <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is adjusted to allow more or less light to pass through it. Conversely in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, which is an array of 410 pixels, individual pixels within the array <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can-be turned &ldquo;off&rdquo; selectively to reduce the amount of light being reflected from the array of <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. This turning off of the pixels at locations throughout the array allows more flexibility in how much light may pass through, thereby allowing &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to be turned &ldquo;off&rdquo;, not only for the effect on the amplitude of the reflected signal, for example, but also for the secondary effects imparted on the signal by the turning off of the particular pixel 412. Secondary effects that can be tailored by this technique include the definition of phase effects upon the composite reflected light signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides an array of pixels such as would be used in a segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and it shows Gaussian light distributions superimposed relative to the array of pixels onto which the light is illuminated or applied. This Gaussian distribution <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> would generally be an elliptical area of light intensity, centered somewhere near the middle of the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, in a rectangular array of pixels comprising the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it may be advantageous to have a tighter Gaussian distribution with respect to the short side of a rectangular segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> than with respect to the long side of the rectangular segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>dimension typically defines the Gaussian distribution, where 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>represents the percentage of power (91%) relative to the total power of the incoming signal. The 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>dimension is chosen typically to lie comfortably within the perimeter of the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, such that excess light energy is not lost outside the boundaries of the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. This arrangement also may avoid light energy spilling onto adjacent segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The exact percentage of light energy contained within the perimeter of the segment is not critical. In most embodiments, however, most of the light energy of a light channel will be confined within the segment or segments assigned to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment that is described above, separate &lgr;&apos;s are designed to be confined within individual segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In certain applications however, it may be desirable to process multiple &lgr;&apos;s within a certain wavelength band. In other words, it may be advantageous to provide a certain type of processing upon a sub-band of &lgr;&apos;s, wherein the sub-band is subset of the entire band <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of wavelengths (&lgr;&apos;s) being carried upon the optical signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this application, instead of single &lgr;&apos;s being devoted to each segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there could be multiple &lgr;&apos;s beginning at the first segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> where &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is shown, and being spaced at approximately equal intervals without regard to segment boundaries. This would allow the DMD arrays within each segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to operate on multiple &lgr;&apos;s simultaneously and to have approximately the same effect on each of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For periodic pixel patterns, the resolution of the pixel patterns being used in the particular segments <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are defined such that the patterns repeat a number of times within the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>area of the Gaussian spot distribution. This allows the system to be less sensitive to alignment variances, because the overall size of the beam relative to any given periodic pattern is great. The Gaussian spot size might be, for example, 20 times the size of a periodic pixel pattern. A small shift in the alignment of the Gaussian spot might then only shift one period relative to the 20 periods of the pixel pattern, but the overall aperture seen by the Gaussian spot will be substantially unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Above, both periodic and non-periodic patterns can be applied as starting pixel patterns that can be used for optical signal processing. It is possible to define a number of these patterns that will achieve certain characteristics and apply these patterns according to a look-up table based on the optical characteristics that are desired and the predicted performance characteristics of a particular pattern. In order to determine the predicted performance characteristics of a particular pattern, it would be possible to measure the optical performance characteristics of those patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to characterize the pixel response of each of the pixels within the array, and to mathematically predict the optical performance of a group of pixels based on the phasor addition of the responses of the individual &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels. Mathematically, the coupling of energy into a single-mode fiber can be described as the summation of phasors as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, the composite optical response is represented by Pr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>n(i,j) represents the magnitude response for the pixel &ldquo;i,j&rdquo; when it is &ldquo;on.&rdquo; I&equals;1 to P and j&equals;1 to Q, if there are P rows and Q columns in the array. A<highlight><subscript>of</subscript></highlight>f(i,j) represents the magnitude response for the pixel &ldquo;i,j&rdquo; when it is &ldquo;off.&rdquo; By the same token, &phgr;<highlight><subscript>on</subscript></highlight>(i,j) and &phgr;<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>(i,j) represent the phase responses for the respective &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A model of the optical response characteristics of the various pixels in an array is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the optical response of individual &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels taken one at a time, mapped across the entire array of pixels within the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows the optical response of the individual &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels taken one at a time. In addition to the magnitude response shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A-<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, there is also a phase effect imparted by the pixel, to the composite optical signal. Therefore, the estimated optical performance characteristics of a group of &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels are determined based on the sum of those pixels&apos; phasor responses according to the Equation (1.1). The concept of this phasor addition is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a mapping of vectors on a phasor coordinate system. A complex number is represented by x&plus;jy, and that complex number can be represented on a coordinate system by placing the x component on the horizontal access, the Y component on the vertical access. The magnitude of the signal will be represented by the ray that passes from the origin of the coordinate system to the XY point mapped onto that coordinate system. To add components in this coordinate system, two vectors can be added by placing the beginning of one vector at the end point of another vector, as described above. The resulting vector would go from the origin of the coordinate system to the end point of the second vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> By adding vectors in the way described above, it is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> that the addition of two vectors having the same magnitude can cause greatly differing results depending on the phase angle of the particular vectors. In this figure, the sum of the &ldquo;off&rdquo; states are shown as the phasor from the origin to the endpoint of the last phasor AN, and the phasor contribution of a single &ldquo;on&rdquo; state pixel is shown by the vector A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(on). The resulting vector &ldquo;R,&rdquo; which is the arrow from the origin to the end point of the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(on) vector, represents the total summation of &ldquo;off&rdquo; and &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels. For a given resultant background &ldquo;off&rdquo; state vector, the magnitude of the result vector &ldquo;R&rdquo; depends on the phase and magnitude of the A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(on) vector, as shown by the circle of radius &verbar;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(on)&verbar;. The most extreme change is the difference between the result vector drawn to the point on the circle closest to the origin of the coordinate system, to the point on the circle farthest from the origin of the coordinate system. Accordingly, to achieve the desired composition optical response, pixels for the patterns are chosen in this embodiment based both on its phase and amplitude effect. The amount of compensation achievable thus depends on the available pixel vectors. The magnitude of these pixels vectors depends on the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>spot size relative to the pixel size. A distribution of available pixel magnitudes can therefore be adjusted by adjusting the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>spot size. The phase of these pixel vectors depends on the alignment of the incoming light phase front and the state of the pixel element (on or off) in the case of a DMD. The distribution of available pixel phases can be adjusted by adjusting the incoming light phase front, or by changing the flatness or scattering properties of the SLM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Not only can the definition of the phasor pixel responses be used to estimate the response of certain patterns, this predicted or estimated pixel response characteristic can be used to fine-tune the response of the optical signal processor relative to the response that was originally provided by the original patterns. The pixel sequence map of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows how this can be done within the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> having multiple pixels <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Within the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, there may be provided groups of pixels that are within in priority class <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. These represent pixels, which may be deemed to be important enough, for proper reflection of the optical signal or to avoid cross reflection from the signals of adjacent segment, such that the pixels are not used for modulation of the incoming optical. These priority class <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> pixels would not be modulated during normal or usual operation, and would thus remain in their original &ldquo;on&rdquo; state. Within the pixel segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, there can be established a priority of pixels to be toggled based on the expected influence of those particular pixels. In other words, the coarser adjustments may be made first by using pixels with a larger magnitude effect on the modulation of incoming light signal, and by then proceeding to pixels having lesser effects. As mentioned, in order to determine the optical response of the given system, it must be kept in mind that each pixel will have both a phase and magnitude response on the overall response of the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As an example for the implementation of priority, the highest priority pixel for modulation might be as shown in the figure. This would be the first pixel to toggle to affect the optical performance characteristics of the spatial light modulator. The pixel labeled &ldquo;2&rdquo; would be the next in priority. The pixel labeled &ldquo;3&rdquo; would be next after that, and so on. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>I show ways in which the priority can be assigned. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> illustrates a &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; pixel assignment priority, wherein the starting pixels are at the outer corners and the assignments generally move to the center of the pattern as the process moves on. The specific ordering of pixels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is an example of one &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; approach, but other orderings could be used to effect a generally spiral-shaped assignment priority. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> illustrates the spiral approach more simply in a one-pixel wide segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>E more generally show an &ldquo;outside-in&rdquo; approach of pixel assignment sequencing. This shows that the pixel assignment process can generally proceed inward from the outside in any dimension within the segment. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>F-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>G shows that an &ldquo;inside-out&rdquo; approach can also be used, whereby the pixel assignment sequence generally moves from the center of the segment toward the outside perimeter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8H</cross-reference> shows a specific variation of the inside-out approach, wherein the pixel assignment sequence proceeds from the center to the outside in radial spokes from a center point. Inversely, a spoke-oriented outside-in approach could also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8I</cross-reference> shows a quadrant symmetry approach, in which for each move in one quadrant, a symmetric move is made in one (or three) other quadrants. Thus, for example, if a move is made in the lower right quadrant, a symmetrical move is made in the upper left quadrant (or, if relying on four-quadrant symmetry, in all three other quadrants). Other variations on this approach would be to divide the segment into other than quadrants, and maintain the symmetry within the other divisions. For example, the segment can be divided into halves, with symmetrical moves in both halves. This &ldquo;quadrant&rdquo; approach results in reduced computation, because if it is assumed that symmetrically placed pixels in all four quadrants have similar effect on the incoming light signal, then the effect can be multiplied by four, and the possible pixel patterns that have to be tested are reduced to one-fourth. This principle could also be applied in the fine-tuning algorithms described below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, wherein the effect of toggling a single pixel could potentially be multiplied by two, three, or four, to approach the target optical performance with fewer computations. Thus, if the computation determines that the toggling of two pixels in the tested position most closely meets the target response, then that result could be used and two of the four symmetrical pixels could be used. Many variations on this approach are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Although the pixel sequence mapping schemes are described above with respect to sequences for the adjustment of individual pixels within segments, the pixel sequence maps could also sequence groups of pixels, whereby multiple pixels can be turned on or off in groups. These pixels could be neighbors to each other, such as all within a block of four adjoining pixels, or they could be symmetrically located to each other, such as symmetrical in two halves or four quarters of a segment. The pixel-mapping scheme described in this application accordingly encompasses these schemes and other consistent pixel mapping approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a high-level algorithm flow for the tuning of an optical signal processor as generally described above. Beginning at block <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, the particular segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> being employed to process a particular optical channel having a particular wavelength, &lgr;, may be initialized and/or calibrated. In order to calibrate the particular segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it first must be determined where the particular Gaussian spot distribution for the channel/wavelength of interest is located within the DMD array. The group of pixels that will form the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is defined in the software to encompass the Gaussian spot distribution, such that most of the 1/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>energy is defined to be well contained within the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. At this time, the individual pixel estimations are made for the individual responses of each of the pixels within the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> based on the known-at-this-time Gaussian spot distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It may be possible to avoid the actual characterization of individual pixel responses by the measurement of the optical response of those signals if the optical response characteristics of groups of pixels is predictable from time-to-time, i.e., if the optical system is well-behaved relative to models which have already been developed for the character of that optical system. In such embodiments, the optical response of varying optical patterns can be mathematically estimated rather than measured. It is also possible, however, to individually measure the response of each pixel once the Gaussian spot distribution has been defined within a given segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Still within block <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, a set of periodic patterns are generated or recalled (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and accompanying text). As with the estimates of phase and amplitude associated with each pixel in a well-behaved system, it may be possible to have a set of periodic patterns that provide predictable responses to the optical signal in a well-behaved system. Alternatively, it may be desirable in a given system to characterize each pattern to determine whether the pattern corresponds with expected optical response characteristics once the patterns are trusted or understood to accurately reflect the optical response characteristic that is desired, this set of patterns can be stored in a look-up table for future reference during the operation of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to having patterns defined for the entire segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to have a set of periodic patterns that will be repeated across the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of pixels. Once the set of patterns to be used, whether defined as an entire non-periodic array pixels or of a repeating set of pixels, the process can proceed to the next step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, certain optical performance instructions are provided to the optical signal processor such that the optical signal processor can achieve the desired optical performance characteristic. The instructions are represented by the input from the block <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> to the processing block <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, the patterns to be applied through the optical signal processor are adjusted to achieve the optical performance characteristics desired. After this first step of synthesis, it is first necessary to send the particular pattern in memory to the DMD mirror display at block <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. At this time, it is possible to illuminate the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with the optical light of the channel/wavelength of interest and measure the actual optical performance, and to determine, according to decision block <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, whether the optical patterns applied to the DMD have achieved the desired optical performance characteristics. For example, in a system where it is desired to provide a certain level of attenuation of the optical channel, the actual attenuation of that channel may be measured for the pattern that has been applied. Based on the stored values of individual pixel responses, individual pixels may be turned &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; within the pixel display according to the pixel sequence map such as defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, or according to another set of priorities. This process can iteratively continue until the desired optical performance is reached, or in this embodiment until the desired optical attenuation is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the optical performance characteristics have been achieved, the program flow can end or can proceed to the next channel (block <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>) and repeat. But, if the desired optical performance characteristics have not been achieved, the program flow returns accordingly to decision block <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> to block <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> via loop <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> to again find new pixels to more finely tune the optical performance of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flowchart exemplifying in greater detail a process for the synthesis of the patterns for achieving desired optical performance levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Beginning at block <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, is the summation of all i&equals;1 to N off-state phasors, plus the present state map multiplied by the delta phasor for each &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixel (in this approach, a delta phasor contribution is added for each &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixel). The &ldquo;i&rdquo; represents individual mirrors, from 1 to N, where &ldquo;N&rdquo; is the total number of pixels. P(i) is a current pattern array where there is one element for every mirror and each element takes on the value of either &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; depending on whether that mirror is off or on. The off-state phasor (i) is the background noise when the &ldquo;i&rdquo;th pixel is turned off. Decision block <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> branches program operation in the direction of decreasing attenuation, which means turning pixels on, or increasing attenuation, which turns pixels off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, from decision block <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, for decreasing attenuation, a processing group <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> is executed for a variable k&equals;1 to N&prime;, where N&prime; is the total number of pixels that are available to be modulated in accordance with the pixel sequence map/table such as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. N&prime; is a number which is less than or equal to N, where N is the total number of pixels <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> within a segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Specifically, N&prime; would be equal to N less the number of pixels in the priority class <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. A function, S(k) describes a pixel sequence map, which may be defined as described with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>I, and maps a sequence number to a pixel number within a segment array. For example, if the 12<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>pixel defined in the pixel array is defined according to the sequence map as the first pixel to be considered, S(12) will return the value &ldquo;1.&rdquo;Thus, the sequence map defines the order in which pixels should be considered when processing a segment, where &ldquo;processing&rdquo; is the act of turning pixels on or off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, k is mapped to the corresponding location within the segment to see whether the corresponding pixel is &ldquo;off,&rdquo; because, assuming that turning &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels decreases attenuation, the goal of decreasing attenuation is accomplished only by turning &ldquo;on&rdquo; those &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels according to the sequence map. The test is described at block <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> is whether P(S(k)) is &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;off.&rdquo; As shown at decision block <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, if the pixel is already &ldquo;on,&rdquo; the process returns to block <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, at which time the next pixel identified by the sequence map function S(k) can be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, the process simulates the effect of turning the S(k) pixel &ldquo;on.&rdquo; At block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, then, the current estimated optical performance characteristic X is estimated by adding to it the delta phasor contributed by the S(k) pixel and squaring the sum. In this example, the optical signal power or attenuation is being estimated.&mdash;The squaring in this example is made for the purposes of this power or attenuation estimate, but other calculations may be used for other types of optical performance estimations. The new value is shown in block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> as X&prime;. At block <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, X&prime; is compared to a target optical performance value to see whether or not it exceeds the target optical performance, which in this example, assuming that each time a pixel is turned on the attenuation is decreased, means that the X&prime; value is closer to the target than X was. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If the X&prime; value is less than or equal to the target, then the process continues at block <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, pixel S(k) of the array, i.e., P(S(k)) is designated to be &ldquo;on,&rdquo; thereby adjusting the optical pattern applied to the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. But if the target was exceeded according to the decision block <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, then the S(k) pixel is left unchanged (i.e., &ldquo;0&rdquo; in this branch) and execution returns to block <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, where k is incremented, and the next pixel (S(k)) in the array is tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For the other branch, of increasing attenuation, the same general algorithm described above is used for an increasing attenuation processing block <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight>, in which &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels are turned &ldquo;off.&rdquo; First, at block <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>, the S(k) pixel is tested to see if it is &ldquo;on.&rdquo; If the pixel is &ldquo;on,&rdquo; the consideration of the pixel continues at block <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> and so on, but if the pixel is already &ldquo;off,&rdquo; there can be no increasing of attenuation in this exemplary embodiment where &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixels are assumed to add power to the output, and the process accordingly returns to block <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> where k can be incremented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If the S(k) pixel is &ldquo;on,&rdquo; however, it is tested at block <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> to see the contribution that would be made by turning the pixel off. This test yields X&prime;, which is the predicted performance characteristic achieved by turning that pixel off. At block <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight>, X&prime; is tested against the target, and if it is less than the target, the process returns back to block <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. But if X&prime; is greater than or equal to the target, then the turning off of the test pixel had the desired result and that S(k) pixel is turned off at block <highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>1029</bold></highlight>, the performance characteristic X is replaced by the X value, and the process continues at block <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. This process essentially adjusts the performance characteristic of a given group of pixels in a non-periodic fashion according to the priorities exemplified in the sequence maps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-I. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The above method describes a procedure for tuning based on estimated or actual optical performance (from measurement of the optical response when the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is illuminated by the light signal) based on the toggling of individual pixels. In the exemplary method above, it is assumed that each &ldquo;on&rdquo; pixel adds power or decreases attenuation to the overall optical response. In other embodiments, however, it is possible that certain pixels within certain patterns can have the inverse effect, in which turning a pixel &ldquo;on&rdquo; can actually increase attenuation by interference effects, and vice versa for &ldquo;off&rdquo; pixels. It is anticipated that for these alternative embodiments that the process can be modified to account for this &ldquo;inverse&rdquo; effect. For example, rather than approaching the target optical performance in a continual level&mdash;all from a single side of the target (e.g., for an attenuation embodiment, either approaching the target attenuation either always remaining above the target in an increasing attenuation situation or always remaining below the target in a decreasing attenuation situation), the methods described herein could be adapted to test in each instance whether toggling the pixel under consideration makes the estimated or actual optical response closer to the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Much of the above discussion relates to adjusting or tuning the optical performance of an SLM based on patterns and the tuning of patterns to achieve certain optical performance characteristics. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a process by which the original patterns to be applied can be initially established or calibrated for a segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or sub-array of pixels within an SLM. In the approach shown here, a periodic pattern such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is developed and repeated across the segment or portions of the segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> loop is established whereby a number of periodic patterns are developed to achieve desired optical performance characteristics. From a definitional standpoint, each starting periodic pattern may be thought of as &ldquo;a<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, and there may be from i&equals;1 to N of these patterns. The measured optical performance characteristics for the corresponding patterns may be referred to as &ldquo;b<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;. Thus, for example, if the optical performance characteristic of interest is attenuation, b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>would be the optical attenuation associated with the pattern, a<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. There may be a number of desired optical performance characteristics, which may be referenced as a look-up vector of such values of M values, where the individual targets Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>are stored in an array having M storage locations, indexed from 1 to M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> starting pattern, a<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, is applied to the segment <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of interest in the SLM. At block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, the optical performance characteristic, b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>associated with the pattern, a<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, is measured. At decision block <highlight><bold>11106</bold></highlight>, b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is compared to the target optical performance (&ldquo;Atten<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;) for each k value, where k is the index for the target optical performance, and where there may be from 1 to M of such target performance levels. If the measured performance is within a maximum desired deviation (&ldquo;&Dgr;&rdquo;) from the target performance, Atten<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, for one or more k values, then a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>can generally be assigned in the system as the pattern to be associated with the target performance, Atten<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>. Having found sufficiently close matches for some or all of the Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>values, the process for finding a potential match for a given Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>could end at this point. Alternatively, a new pattern can be sought that still more closely approximates the target performance. The pattern which is intermediately stored or finally stored to achieve the target performance is described herein as &ldquo;AttenPattern,&rdquo; and there would be k&equals;1 to M of these patterns, corresponding to the 1-to-M target performance levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the first time through the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, that the initial pattern, AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is a &ldquo;null&rdquo; pattern, which is a default value&mdash;typically a value that would be invalid as an actual pattern. At block <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, the process tests to see whether such a null pattern is presently stored in the AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>. In the event that AttenPattern has the &ldquo;null&rdquo; value stored in it, then the &ldquo;null&rdquo; value for AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is replaced at block <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> with the present a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>pattern. At block <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, the b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>performance relative to the target Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is compared to a prior value, represented by &ldquo;b<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;. If b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is closer to Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>than b<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>, then at block <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>, a<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>, which had been stored in AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>as the pattern to achieve this Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>performance, is replaced in AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>with a<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, thereby adjusting the optical pattern associated with the Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>performance level. If, on the other hand, b<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is determined to be approximately equal to b<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>according to the test at block <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, then at block <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>, either a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>or a<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>may be stored in AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At block <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, after the a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>pattern has been assigned, if possible, to a performance level and a corresponding location within the AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>array, the process for the next periodic pattern continues at block <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. The overall loop continues, proceeding from block <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> through to <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> through applicable intermediate steps, until all &ldquo;i&rdquo; values of a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>have been satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> At the end of the process, AttenPattern will be a lookup vector of patterns to achieve Atten. In other words, AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>will contain a pattern a<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>that produces Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>within a specified measure or &ldquo;&Dgr;,&rdquo; although as described below, not all AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>&apos;s will necessarily have assigned patterns. Also shown is a &ldquo;fine tuning&rdquo; block <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>, which can be used to adjust the optical patterns to approximate more closely the target optical performance values. Processes for &ldquo;fine tuning&rdquo; can be followed here in accordance with some of the techniques that have been previously described in this application, such as the one described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. For example, if, having followed the above process, some values of AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>are still null, another algorithm can be used, for example, starting with a pattern a<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>that yields a performance characteristic b<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is closest to the target optical performance Atten<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>for the still null AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>array location. For example, from the starting value for these null AttenPattern<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>locations, previously described fine tuning algorithms can be used to adjust the patterns applied to achieve the desired optical performance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a system to carry out the methods of generating patterns for a spatial light modulator described in this application. The system includes a DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that operates under control of a microprocessor <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor is used here as a general term describing control circuitry, and it encompasses digital signal processors and peripheral circuitry that may be interposed between an actual microprocessor and the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with a memory <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, which may more specifically be a look-up table <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor can retrieve pixel patterns by sending a look-up value to the table or by generating an actual address for a particular memory location representing an address in a look-up table. Within the microprocessor <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is included a pattern processing block <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, which can adapt particular patterns either to be applied to the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or to be stored back into the look-up table, depending on whether the optical performance of the DMD is being tuned or the patterns in the look-up table <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> are being refined or generated. As indicated by the dashed line between the look-up up table <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> and the DMD <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to bypass the microprocessor <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> in providing patterns to the DMD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor 1202 is operable to generate and apply a pixel pattern to the spatial light modulator <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. If an optical signal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then applied to the SLM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a sensor <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> can be provided at the output <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the system or elsewhere, to measure actual performance of the SLM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having the pixel pattern applied to it. The microprocessor receives an signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, indicating the performance of the SLM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and accordingly can adjust the pattern being applied to the SLM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to more closely achieve a target optical response value. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> can also store an updated pattern in the look-up table <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> so that the updated pattern can more closely match the target optical performance. </paragraph>
