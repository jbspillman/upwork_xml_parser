<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to clutch and brake arrangements for rotating bodies, and in particular to such arrangements for rotating bodies forming part of agricultural machines, such as combine harvesters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Agricultural machines such as combine harvesters comprise rotating components such as a threshing drum and straw chopper. When working, these components rotate at high speeds. When the combine harvester experiences no load, components which have been running at working speeds continue to rotate for some time due to inertia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When an operator has shut a machine down, particularly if he has turned off the engine or disengaged drive to a certain part, he does not expect certain components to continue to rotate. However, high inertia components will continue to rotate until the inertia dissipates. There is, therefore, a need to reduce the period in which high inertia components rotate when not under load. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a straw chopper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprising a rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is mounted a drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having blades <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven through a drive assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprising a pulley wheel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> attached to the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of bearings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The pulley wheel can therefore rotate freely on the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> if such free rotation is not otherwise constrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The drive assembly <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> further comprises a bush <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> attached to the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the bush <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> being fixed to the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith. A mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is slidably mounted on the bushing <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, but is prevented from rotating by means of splines. A clutch member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is affixed to one end of the mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by means of bolts <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The clutch member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises a friction surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which engages with the inner surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the pulley wheel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> under the force of the Belleville spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the Belleville spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fits around the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. One end of the Belleville spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constrained by a step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The other end of the Belleville spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sits in a recess formed in the mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The Belleville spring therefore pushes the clutch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into engagement with the pulley wheel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby transmitting rotation of the pulley wheel to the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to drive the straw chopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Moving the lever moves the collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is moved only when the thrust plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> touches the brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thereby moves the collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> i.e. only during braking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprises an outwardly extending portion having a brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> affixed to the surface of the said extending portion facing the pulley wheel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends around the mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and is movable in the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is a gap <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> between the brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the surface of the ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The gap <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is present because the clutch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is engaged and there is no requirement to brake the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Extending radially outwards from the ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a pair of lugs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each lug of the pair mounting a bolt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a coil spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Movement of the ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the axial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is generated by a lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the drive unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is shown in the state where the clutch is disengaged and the brake engaged. Transition to this state from the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where the clutch is engaged and the brake is disengaged is achieved by moving the lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As the lever <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is moved towards the body of the combine harvester in the direction X the gap <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is closed and the inward facing surface of the ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engages with the brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As the lever is moved further in the direction X the ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes the mounting collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> against the Belleville spring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, compressing the spring further and lifting the clutch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> out of engagement with the inner face <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the pulley wheel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The bolts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the springs <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> ensure that the thrust plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is kept clear of the rotating hub <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the brake is disengaged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (the bolt <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be adjusted to equalize the clearance between thrust plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and brake pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at the top and the bottom). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, there is shown a combine harvester <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprising a header <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a reel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an operator&apos;s cab <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, front and rear wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a threshing mechanism including a drum <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and straw walkers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and at the rear of the combine harvester a straw chopper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The clutch and brake assembly of the invention is particularly advantageous because the rotating body (in this case a straw chopper) is brought to a halt by the brake when the clutch is disengaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the principle and mode of operation of this invention have been explained and illustrated in its preferred embodiment. However, it must be understood that this invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or scope. </paragraph>
