<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and to a projection liquid crystal display apparatus which displays an image by using the liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, projection liquid crystal display apparatuses (liquid crystal projectors) which project light modulated by liquid crystal display devices (hereinafter referred to as liquid crystal panels) on a screen and thereby display an image on the screen are known in the art. There are two types of image-projection methods used in projection liquid crystal display apparatuses: a front projection type (front type) in which an image is projected onto the screen from the front side of a screen, and a rear projection type (rear type) in which an image is projected onto a screen from the rear side of the screen. In addition, there are two types of projection liquid crystal display apparatuses for displaying color images: a single-panel type in which a single liquid crystal panel is used and a three-panel type in which three liquid crystal panels for three colors, that is, red (R), green (G), and blue (B), are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing an optical system (mainly an illuminating optical system) of a projection liquid crystal display apparatus of the known art. In this projection liquid crystal display apparatus, a light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, first and second multi-lens array integrators (hereinafter abbreviated as MLAs) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> forming a pair, a PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a condenser lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a field lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and a projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are arranged along an optical axis <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The MLAs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> include a plurality of small lenses (microlenses) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>M, respectively, which are arranged two-dimensionally. The PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of half-wave plates <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A at positions corresponding to the positions between adjacent microlenses on the second MLA <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this projection liquid crystal display apparatus, illuminating light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of light beams when it passes through the MLAs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The light beams emitted from the MLAs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are incident on the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Light L<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is incident on the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a P-polarized light component and a S-polarized light component which intersect each other on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> serves to separate the incident light L<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the two kinds of polarized light components (a P-polarized light component and an S-polarized light component) L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After the polarized light components L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are separated from each other, the light component L<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> leaves the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> without changing its polarization direction (for example, the P-polarization). Conversely, the polarization direction of the light component L<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (for example, the S-polarization) is changed to the other direction (for example, the P-polarization) by the half-wave plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A upon exiting the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, light having a predetermined polarization direction is emitted from the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from the PS composite element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> passes through the condenser lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the field lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and is radiated onto the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The divided light beams formed by the MLAs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are magnified at a magnification ratio determined on the basis of the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the focal length f<highlight><subscript>ML2 </subscript></highlight>of the microlenses <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>M formed on the second MLA <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and are radiated onto the entire incident surface of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a plurality of magnified light beams overlap one another on the incident surface of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, thereby uniformly illuminating the incident surface of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> spatially modulates the light incident thereon in accordance with an image signal, and emits modulated light. The light emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is projected onto a screen (not shown) by the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, so that an image is formed on the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In liquid crystal panels, in order to form driving devices such as thin-film transistors (TFTs) on a substrate, a light-shielding area called a black-matrix is formed to separate adjacent pixels. Accordingly, aperture ratios of liquid crystal panels never reach 100%. Therefore, in liquid crystal panels of the known art, in order to increase the effective aperture ratio, one or more microlenses are arranged along an optical axis for each dot (a single pixel or a single sub-pixel), the microlenses being formed on an opposing substrate disposed at the light-incident side and serving as condenser lenses. The &ldquo;effective aperture ratio&rdquo; is the ratio of light beams emitted from a liquid crystal panel to light beams incident on the liquid crystal panel. In projection liquid crystal display apparatuses, the effective aperture ratio is generally determined by taking into account not only the light loss caused in the liquid crystal panel but also the shading of light caused by the projection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of the construction of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in which microlenses are formed. In order to make the figure clear, the hatching is partly omitted. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> includes a pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B and an opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A which is disposed at the light-incident side of the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B in such a manner that the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A and the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B oppose each other with a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B includes a glass substrate <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, a plurality of pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. The pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> are arranged two-dimensionally on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> at the light-incident side thereof. The pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are conductive, transparent members, and the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> are formed between adjacent pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> are shielded from light by, for example, a metal layer, and switching elements (not shown) used for selectively applying a voltage to the adjacent pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in accordance with an image signal are formed inside the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. TFTs, for example, are used as the switching elements for applying a voltage to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A includes a glass substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a microlens array <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and a cover glass <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in that order from the light-incident side. A resin layer <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is laminated between the glass substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the microlens array <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In addition, although not shown in the figure, opposing electrodes for generating a voltage between the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the opposing electrodes are arranged between the cover glass <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The resin layer <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is formed of an optical plastic whose refractive index is n1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The microlens array <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is formed of an optical plastic whose refractive index is n2 (&gt;n1), and includes a plurality of microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M are convex toward the light-incident side thereof and have positive refractive power. Each microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M serves to condense light incident thereon through the glass substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the resin layer <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> on the corresponding pixel electrode unit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. When the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a sufficient F-number, the light which is condensed by the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M and passes though apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>A is utilized for displaying an image. When the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M are provided, the amount of light that passes through the apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>A of the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> can be increased compared with a case in which the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M are not provided. Accordingly, the effective aperture ratio can be increased and the light-utilizing efficiency can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> having the above-described construction, when a light component <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> whose divergence angle relative to an optical axis <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is &bgr; is incident on one of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M, it is refracted by the power of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M and is emitted in such a state that the divergence angle is increased compared with a case in which the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M are not provided. The divergence angle of the emitted light (emission divergence angle), &thgr;, is the sum of the angle a generated by the power of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M and the initial angle &bgr;. Accordingly, the following equation is given: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&thgr;&equals;&agr;&plus;&bgr;&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When f<highlight><subscript>ML </subscript></highlight>is the focal length of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M and is the external size (diameter) of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M, the angle &agr; generated by the power of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M is defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>tan &agr;&equals;<highlight><italic>a/f</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ML</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When fc and rc are the focal length and the radius, respectively, of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), the divergence angle of the illuminating light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (incident divergence angle), &bgr;, is defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>tan &bgr;&equals;<highlight><italic>rc/fc</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the divergence angle of the light emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is &thgr;, the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> must have an F-number (Fno) defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Fno&equals;</italic></highlight>1/(2 sin &thgr;)&emsp;&emsp;(4) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the above-described liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, when light having a large divergence angle &bgr; is incident thereon, the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M cannot sufficiently focus the light into the apertures <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>A, so that the light is partly blocked by the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. In addition, when the incident divergence angle &bgr; is large, the degree of divergence of the emitted light is increased by the power of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M compared with the case in which the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M are not provided, and the emission divergence angle &thgr; is increased, as is clear from Equation (1). On the other hand, the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> cannot receive light which is incident at an angle exceeding the angle determined by the F-number defined by Equation (4). Accordingly, shading occurs at the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when the emission divergence angle &thgr; is too large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in order to improve the light-utilizing efficiency by using the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M, the incident divergence angle &bgr; must be reduced. However, as is understood from Equation (3), in order to reduce the incident divergence angle &bgr;, the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> must be increased. In addition, the focal length of the microlenses <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>M of the second MLA <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> must also be increased. Accordingly, when the incident divergence angle &bgr; is reduced, the optical path length from the light source <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is increased. When the optical path length is increased, the overall size of the apparatus is also increased and the light-utilizing efficiency in the overall illuminating optical system, that is, the system including the illuminating optical system positioned before the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, is reduced. When a lens having an F-number corresponding to high brightness which is sufficient for the emission divergence angle &thgr; (for example, F-number&equals;1.2 to 1.5) is used as the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, shading at the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. However, there is a problem in that lenses having F-numbers corresponding to high brightness are difficult to design and thus high costs are incurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The problems of the above-described illuminating system and the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M formed in the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> can be summarized as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (i) Light having a large incident divergence angle &bgr; causes shading at the black matrix elements in the liquid crystal panel or at the projection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (ii) Although the effective aperture ratio of the liquid crystal panel can be increased by reducing the incident divergence angle &bgr;, the light-utilizing efficiency of the overall illuminating system is reduced and the size of the apparatus is increased in such a case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (iii) The divergence angle &thgr; of the light emitted from the liquid crystal panel is determined as the sum of the angle a generated by the power of the microlenses and the incident divergence angle &bgr;, and is larger than that in the case in which the microlenses are not provided. Accordingly, a lens having an F-number corresponding to high brightness which is sufficient for the emission divergence angle &thgr; must be used as the projection lens. Such a projection lens is difficult to design and thus high costs are incurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shading at the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> described in (i) can be reduced by reducing the focal length of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M in the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. However, in such a case, the angle a generated by the power of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M is increased, so that the emission divergence angle &thgr; is also increased. Accordingly, the problems described in (iii) occur. When the F-number of the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is reduced in order to increase the brightness, problems occur in that imaging performance is degraded and the size of the projection lens itself and the manufacturing costs are increased. In actual projection liquid crystal display apparatuses, the focal length f<highlight><subscript>ML </subscript></highlight>of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M is increased and the distance between the pixel apertures and the microlenses is optimized in accordance with the F-number of the projection lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the problems described in (i) and (ii) are not solved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a liquid crystal panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> has been suggested in which another microlens array <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is disposed on the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B, and the angle a generated by the power of the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M formed in the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A is canceled when the light is emitted from the microlens array <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the microlens array <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A is formed directly on the glass substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> at the light-emission side thereof. In addition, another microlens array <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> formed of an optical resin is disposed on the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B at the light-emission side thereof. In addition, a glass substrate <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is disposed on the microlens array <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> at the light-emission side thereof. The microlens array <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of microlenses <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M which correspond to the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M formed in the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A. The microlenses <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M are convex at the light-emission side thereof and have positive refractive power. Each microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M is constructed such that it serves as a collimator by being combined with the corresponding microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M. When n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the microlenses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M, respectively, and n3 and n4 are the refractive indexes of the microlenses <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, respectively, the liquid crystal panel is constructed such that n2&gt;n1 and n3&gt;n4 are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a light component <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, for example, is incident on the liquid crystal panel as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, it is refracted by an angle a by the power of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M formed in the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A. Then, the light component is refracted by the angle &minus;&agr; in the opposite direction by the corresponding microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M formed on the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B due to the function thereof as a collimator. Accordingly, the angle a generated by the power of the microlens <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>M formed in the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A is canceled when it is emitted from the microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M. Since the angle &agr; is canceled, the emission divergence angle &thgr; is given by &thgr;&equals;&bgr; from Equation (1), and is reduced by the angle &agr; compared with the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. However, when the microlenses are arranged as described above, if, for example, a light component <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, whose incident divergence angle is &bgr; and which must be incident on a microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is incident on the adjacent microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the microlens <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> cannot serve as a collimator for this incident light component. In such a case, the above-described relationship (&thgr;&equals;&bgr;) cannot be obtained and the emission divergence angle &thgr; becomes larger than the incident divergence angle &bgr;, so that the effective aperture ratio cannot be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 5-341283 discloses a liquid crystal panel in which the incident divergence angle &bgr; is canceled. The liquid crystal panel disclosed in this publication includes a pair of glass substrates and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the glass substrates, and microlenses are arranged on both sides of at least one of the glass substrates in correspondence with pixel apertures. In this liquid crystal panel, the focal length of the microlenses formed at one side of the glass substrate is made the same as the focal length of the microlenses formed at the other side of the glass substrate. In addition, the distance between the microlenses formed at one side of the glass substrate and the microlenses formed at the other side of the glass substrate is made the same as the focal length. When collimated light is incident, the microlenses at either side of the glass substrate serve to converge the light on the surface at the other side. Thus, the incident divergence angle &bgr; is canceled before the light is emitted. According to this publication, the microlenses are formed by the ion-exchange method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the above-described publication, the microlenses at either side of the substrate are convex toward the inside and the surfaces facing outward (surfaces at both sides of the substrate) are flat. In addition, the distance between the microlenses formed at the side closer to the pixel apertures and the pixel apertures is approximately 0. In this case, the thickness of the substrate including the microlenses is about several tens of micrometers. However, in the above-described construction, there is a problem in that the substrate including the microlenses is extremely difficult to manufacture. Especially when the ion-exchange method is applied, it is difficult to control the thickness, and it is also difficult to process a thin substrate whose thickness is several tens of micrometers at a high precision so as to obtain the desired optical characteristics. For example, although the lens surfaces of the microlenses formed at both sides of the substrate must be polished in order to obtain the desired optical characteristics, it is extremely difficult to polish a thin substrate whose thickness is several tens of micrometers. In recent years, high-precision liquid crystal panels with small pixel pitches have been required, so that high processing precision is necessary. Accordingly, the liquid crystal panel according to the above-described publication has a disadvantage in this point. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In consideration of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device and a projection liquid crystal display apparatus in which the effective aperture ratio can be increased and the light-utilizing efficiency can be improved without increasing the size or complicating the manufacturing process. In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device and a projection liquid crystal display apparatus in which the light-collection efficiency is optimized by adjusting the positional relationship between the microlenses and the pixel apertures along the optical axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the above-described objects of the present invention, a liquid-crystal display according to the present invention includes a liquid crystal layer; a plurality of pixel electrodes, having pixel apertures which allow light to pass therethrough; and at least one microlens array disposed at at least one of a light-incident side and a light-emission side of the liquid crystal layer, the microlens array having a plurality of microlenses arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel apertures. Each microlens includes a condenser lens and a field lens, the condenser lens having at least one lens surface along an optical axis and condensing light incident thereon toward the corresponding pixel aperture, and the field lens having at least one lens surface along the optical axis and being constructed such that the focal point of the field lens is at approximately the same position as the principal point of the condenser lens. In addition, the overall focal point of the condenser lens and the field lens is shifted from the corresponding pixel aperture and the amount of shift is set such that an effective aperture ratio is increased compared with the case in which the overall focal point is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture. Preferably, the amount of shift exceeds &plusmn;10% of the overall focal length. In addition, preferably, when light having a divergence angle component is incident, the divergence angle component is eliminated by the optical behavior of the field lens when the light is emitted from the microlens array, so that the emission angle of the incident light is the same as an emission angle of a principal ray which is incident parallel to the optical axis. The liquid crystal display device may be used in a projection liquid crystal display apparatus in which light that has passed through the liquid crystal display device is projected by a projection lens. In such a case, a numerical aperture of each microlens is set such that the numerical aperture approximately corresponds to an F-number of the projection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the present invention, a projection liquid crystal display apparatus includes a light source which emits light; a liquid crystal display device which serves to modulate incident light; and a projection lens which projects light modulated by the liquid crystal display device. The liquid crystal display device includes a liquid crystal layer, a plurality of pixel electrodes, having pixel apertures which allow light to pass therethrough, and at least one microlens array disposed at at least one of a light-incident side and a light-emission side of the liquid crystal layer, the microlens array having a plurality of microlenses arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel apertures. Each microlens includes a condenser lens and a field lens, the condenser lens having at least one lens surface along an optical axis and condensing light incident thereon toward the corresponding pixel aperture, and the field lens having at least one lens surface along the optical axis and being constructed such that the focal point of the field lens is at approximately the same position as the principal point of the condenser lens. In addition, the overall focal point of the condenser lens and the field lens is shifted from the corresponding pixel aperture and the amount of shift is set such that an effective aperture ratio is increased compared with the case in which the overall focal point is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device and the projection liquid crystal display apparatus according to the present invention, each microlens is constructed of a condenser lens and a field lens. The condenser lens serves to condense light emitted from the light source and incident on the condenser lens toward the corresponding pixel aperture, and the field lens is constructed such that the focal point thereof is at approximately the same position as the principal point of the condenser lens. In such a construction, when light having a divergence angle component relative to an optical axis is incident on the microlens, the divergence angle component is eliminated when the light is emitted therefrom. Accordingly, even when the focal length of the microlens is reduced, the divergence angle of the emitted light can be prevented from being increased. When the liquid crystal display device is used in a projection liquid crystal display, shading of light due to projection lens can be reduced. In addition, according to the present invention, the pixel aperture is shifted from the overall focal point of the condenser lens and the field lens, and the amount of shift is set such that the effective aperture ratio is increased compared with the case in which the overall focal point is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture. When all of the angular components of the incident light are analyzed, the effective aperture ratio is not always optimum when the overall focal point is at exactly the same position as the pixel aperture. When all of the angular components are taken into account, the effective aperture ratio is increased when the overall focal point of the microlens is shifted away from the pixel aperture. Accordingly, the positional relationship between the overall focal point and the pixel aperture is preferably optimized so that the effective aperture ratio can be increased. The effective aperture ratio shows the ratio of the light beams passing through the microlens, the pixel aperture, and the projection lens to the light beams emitted from the light source and incident on the pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the liquid crystal display device and the projection liquid crystal display apparatus of the present invention, the effective aperture ratio can be increased and the light-utilizing efficiency can be improved without increasing the size or complicating the manufacturing process. Thus, the light-utilizing efficiency can be improved and the optical output can be increased, and the size of the projection liquid crystal display apparatus and the cost of the projection lens can be reduced. Furthermore, an allowable displacement between the substrate in which the pixel apertures are formed and the substrate in which the microlenses are formed can be increased. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the overall construction of a projection liquid crystal display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. The projection liquid crystal display apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is of the three-panel type in which three transmissive liquid crystal panels are used for displaying a color image. This projection liquid crystal display apparatus includes a light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which emits light, first and second multi-lens array integrators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (hereinafter abbreviated as MLAs) forming a pair, and a reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is disposed between the MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the direction of a light path (an optical axis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is changed by 90 degrees toward the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are provided with a plurality of microlenses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>M and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>M, respectively, which are arranged two-dimensionally. The MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> serve to divide the incident light into a plurality of light beams, and thereby make the luminance distribution uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> emits white light including red, blue, and green light components, which are necessary for displaying a color image. The light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes an illuminant (not shown) which emits white light and a concave mirror which reflects and condenses the light emitted by the illuminant. The illuminant may be, for example, a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon lamp, etc. The concave mirror preferably has a shape such that a high light-collection efficiency is obtained, and a mirror having a rotationally symmetric surface, such as a spheroid mirror or a paraboloid mirror, is used as the concave mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The projection liquid crystal display apparatus also includes a PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in that order from the light-emission side of the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> serves to separate the incident light into, for example, a red light component LR and light components corresponding to the other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of half-wave plates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A at positions corresponding to the positions between adjacent microlenses of the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> serves to separate the incident light L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> into two kinds of polarized light components (a P-polarized light component and a S-polarized light component) L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After the polarized light components L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are separated from each other, the light component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaves the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> without changing its polarization direction (for example, the P-polarization). Conversely, the polarization direction of the light component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (for example, the S-polarization) is changed to the other direction (for example, the P-polarization) by the half-wave plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A upon exiting the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> reflects the red light component LR toward the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R spatially modulates the red light component LR, which is incident thereon through the field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>R, in accordance with an image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The projection liquid crystal display apparatus also includes a dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> disposed in the path of the light components corresponding to colors other than red.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The projection liquid crystal display apparatus also includes a field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>G and a liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G in that order along the light path of the green light component LG, which is split off by the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G spatially modulates the green light component LG, which is incident thereon through the field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>G, in accordance with the image signal. </paragraph>

The reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reflects the blue light component LB, which is incident thereon through the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, toward the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> reflects the blue light component LB, which is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is incident on the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the relay lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, toward the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B spatially modulates the blue light component LB, which is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B through the field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, in accordance with the image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The projection liquid crystal display apparatus also includes a cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is placed at a position where the red light component LR, the green light component LG, and the blue light component LB intersect and which serves to combine the three light components LR, LG, and LB. In addition, the projection liquid crystal display apparatus also includes a projection lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which projects the combined light emitted from the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> onto a screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has three incident surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B, and one emission surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>T. The red light component LR emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>R, the green light component LG emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>G, and the blue light component LB emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B.

Although the liquid crystal panels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B modify light components corresponding to different colors, the function and construction thereof are substantially the same. In the following descriptions, the construction of the liquid crystal panels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B will be described. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in order to make the figure clear, the hatching is partly omitted. The liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B) includes a pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B and an opposing substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A which is disposed at the light-incident side of the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B in such a manner that the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A and the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B oppose each other with a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>

TFTs, for example, are used as the switching elements for applying a voltage to the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> surrounded by the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> have apertures through which the incident light is able to pass, each aperture serving as a pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A corresponding to a single pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The opposing substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A includes a glass substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A, a microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B, and a cover glass <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in that order from the light-incident side. Although not shown in the figure, the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A also includes opposing electrodes and an alignment film disposed between the cover glass <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The opposing electrodes are used for generating a voltage between pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the opposing electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed of an optical plastic and includes a plurality of microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M have positive refractive power, and each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M serves to condense light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the corresponding pixel electrode unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. When the projection lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a sufficient F-number, most of the light which is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, condensed by the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, and passes though apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is utilized for displaying an image. In order to effectively utilize the light emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the F-number of the projection lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is preferably set to a value corresponding to the same or a higher brightness compared with the brightness determined by the numerical aperture of the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M includes two lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are arranged along the optical axis for a single pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, that is, a single dot (a single pixel or a single sub-pixel). Both lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have positive refractive power. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, both lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have a spherical shape, and the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is convex toward the light-incident side (toward the light source) and the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is convex toward the light-emission side. In order for the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to have positive refractive power, when n1, n2, and n3 are the refractive indexes of the first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A, the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B, respectively, n2&gt;n1 and n2&gt;n3 are satisfied. The difference between the refractive indexes n2 and n1 is, for example, about 0.2 to 0.3, and preferably higher. Similarly, the difference between the refractive indexes n2 and n3 is about <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and preferably higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, the focal point of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at approximately the same position as the principal point H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In addition, the overall focal point of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M is shifted from the position of the corresponding pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. The amount of shift is set such that the effective aperture ratio is increased compared with the case in which the overall focal point of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. The first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serves as a condenser lens having a light-condensing function, and the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> serves as a field lens. The overall focal point of the microlens is defined as the point of overall focus of the condenser lens and the field lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In general, it is considered that the effective aperture ratio is improved as the overall focal point of the microlens is made closer to the pixel aperture. However, when all of the angular components of the incident light are taken into account, the effective aperture ratio is not always optimum when the overall focal point is at exactly the same position as the pixel aperture. When all of the angular components are taken into account, the effective aperture ratio is increased when the overall focal point of the microlens is shifted away from the pixel aperture along the optical axis. Accordingly, in the present invention, the positional relationship between the overall focal point of the microlens and the pixel aperture along the optical axis is optimized, so that the collection efficiency of the pixel aperture can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The shapes of the first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A, the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B are not limited to the shapes shown in the figure as long as the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have positive refractive power and exhibit the desired optical characteristics. In addition, as long as the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have sufficient power to function as the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, the resin layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B can be omitted and the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be directly disposed between the glass substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the cover glass <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Next, a method for manufacturing the microlens array in the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will be described below. First, the first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and the second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B are manufactured. The first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A is manufactured by forming, for example, an acrylic resin with a stamper having the pattern of the first lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. The second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B is similarly manufactured by forming, for example, an acrylic resin with a stamper having the pattern of the second lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. The thus formed resin layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B are disposed such that they oppose each other, and an optical resin (for example, urethane resin, acrylic resin, etc.) for forming the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is injected between the resin layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B. The optical resin serves as an adhesive, so that the first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A, the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B are combined together. Then, the outside surfaces of the first resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and the second resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B are polished. The method for manufacturing the microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not limited to the above-described method, and other methods may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, layers such as the cover glass <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the alignment film (not shown), and the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> placed between the second lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A are preferably made as thin as possible (for example, the overall thickness is preferably made 5 to 25 &mgr;m in air). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a comparative example of a liquid crystal panel. The basic construction of the liquid crystal panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is the same as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and similar components are denoted by the same reference numerals in order to facilitate understanding. The liquid crystal panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> differs from the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in that the overall focal point of each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. In this case, a spot image at the pixel aperture and a diaphragm of the illuminating light are conjugate to each other, and the intensity distribution at the diaphragm is directly projected onto the pixel aperture. However, since the light emitted from the lamp is not always uniform, the intensity thereof differs in accordance with the angle at which the light is incident on the panel. Accordingly, the spot image at the focal position does not always correspond to the maximum transmission efficiency at the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the projection liquid crystal display apparatus having the above-described construction will be described. First, the overall operation of the projection liquid crystal display apparatus will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The white light emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of light beams when it passes through the MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The light beams emitted from the MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are incident on the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Light incident on the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a P-polarized light component and a S-polarized light component which intersect each other on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> serves to separate the incident light L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, into the two kinds of polarized light components (a P-polarized light component and a S-polarized light component) L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After the polarized light components L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are separated from each other, the light component L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> leaves the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> without changing its polarization direction (for example, the P-polarization). Conversely, the polarization direction of the light component L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (for example, the S-polarization) is changed to the other direction (for example, the P-polarization) by the half-wave plate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A upon exiting the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, light having a predetermined polarization direction (for example, the P-polarization) is emitted from the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> passes through the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is incident on the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The light incident on the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is divided into, for example, the red light component LR and light components corresponding to other colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The red light component LR split off by the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> toward the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R. The red light component LR reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> passes through the field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>R and is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R. Then, the red light component LR incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R is spatially modulated by the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R in accordance with the image signal, and is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>R of the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The light components corresponding to colors other than red, which are split off by the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, are incident on the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and are divided into, for example, the green light component LG and the blue light component LB. The green light component LG split off by the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> passes through the field lens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>G and is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G. Then, the green light component LG incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G is spatially modulated by the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G in accordance with the image signal, and is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>G of the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The blue light component LB split off by the dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> passes through the relay lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is incident on the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> toward the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The blue light component LB reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> passes through the relay lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is incident on the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> toward the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, and is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B. Then, the blue light component LB incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B is spatially modulated by the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B in accordance with the image signal, and is incident on the incident surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The divided light beams formed by the MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are enlarged and overlap one another on the incident surfaces of the liquid crystal panels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B, thereby uniformly illuminating the liquid crystal panels <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B. The divided light beams formed by the MLAs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are enlarged at a magnification ratio determined on the basis of and the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the focal length f<highlight><subscript>MLA2 </subscript></highlight>of the microlenses <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>M formed on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The three light components LR, LG, and LB incident on the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are combined by the cross prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the combined light is emitted toward the projection lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> through the emission surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>T. The emitted light is projected onto the front surface or the rear surface of the screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that an image is formed on the screen <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, the optical operation and effects of the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, which characterize the present embodiment, will be described below mainly with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In order to make the figure simple, only main components of the microlenses formed in the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As explained above, the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M have positive refractive power. In addition, the focal point of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at approximately the same position as the principal point H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the overall focal point of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M is shifted from the position of the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. In the following descriptions, it is assumed that illuminating light which is emitted from the illuminating optical system positioned before the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and whose divergence angle is &bgr; is incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> over the entire area thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> First, a principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A (shown by the solid line in the figure), which is parallel to an optical axis <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, is considered. The principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A is converged into the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A by the overall power of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. The maximum divergence angle a of light emitted from the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M relative to the optical axis <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is determined on the basis of the relationship between the maximum external size of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M and the overall focal length of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. More specifically, when is the external size (diameter) of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M and the overall focal length is f, the following equation is satisfied: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>tan &agr;&equals;<highlight><italic>a/f</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When f1 is the focal length of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and f2 is the focal length of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the overall focal length is determined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>f&equals;f</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>&times;f</italic></highlight>2/(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>&plus;f</italic></highlight>2&minus;&Dgr;)&emsp;&emsp;(6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> where &Dgr; is the distance between the principal point H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the principal point H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When the focal point of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at the same position as the principal point H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &Dgr;&equals;f2 is satisfied. Accordingly, the overall focal length f is determined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>f&equals;f2&emsp;&emsp;(7) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Equation (7) shows that the overall focal length f is always f2 irrespective of the focal length f1 of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. From Equations (5) and (7), it is understood that the maximum emission divergence angle a of the principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A is determined only by the external size (radius) a of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M and the focal length f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, in this case, the overall focal point of the entire lens system can be controlled without changing the overall focal length f of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M, by adjusting the focal length f1 of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By suitably setting the focal length fl, the distance between the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be made sufficiently large from the viewpoint of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, divergent rays <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B (shown by the dashed lines in the figure), which are incident at an angle relative to the optical axis <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, will be considered. When light whose divergence angle is &plusmn;&bgr; relative to the optical axis <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> illuminates the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, it passes through the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in such a state that the divergence angle relative to the principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A remains &plusmn;&bgr;. Then, since the focal point of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at approximately the same position as the principal point H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the light becomes parallel to the principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A when it passes through the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. More specifically, both the principal ray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A and the divergent rays <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B have the same maximum emission divergence angle a when they are emitted from the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M has the above-described optical function, the maximum emission divergence angle &thgr; of the light emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&thgr;&equals;&agr;&emsp;&emsp;(8) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Equation (8) shows that the emission divergence angle &thgr; of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is also determined only on the basis of the external size (radius) a of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M and the focal length f2 of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the incident divergence angle &bgr; does not effect the emission divergence angle &thgr;. More specifically, according to the present embodiment, the incident divergence angle &bgr; of the illuminating light is eliminated when the light is emitted from the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so that the emission divergence angle &thgr; can be reduced by &bgr; compared with the example of the known art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, even when the overall focal length of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M is reduced, the shading at the black matrix elements <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> can be reduced compared with the example of the known art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the focal length of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M can be greatly reduced without reducing the effective aperture ratio, and the spot size of light condensed on the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A can also be greatly reduced. As a result, the effective aperture ratio of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the spot size of the condensed light relative to the size of the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A can be greatly reduced compared with the known art. Therefore, the incident divergence angle &bgr; can be increased compared with the known art. In addition, as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the incident divergence angle is increased, the spot size of the condensed light can be increased to the limit, that is, the size of the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, so that the amount of emitted light can be increased. When the incident divergence angle &bgr; is increased, the amount of light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the size of a housing for installing the optical system are greatly affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when fc and rc are the focal length and the radius, respectively, of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the divergence angle &bgr; of the illuminating light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, is defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>tan &bgr;&equals;<highlight><italic>rc/fc</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the incident divergence angle &bgr; is determined on the basis of the radius rc and the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, the radius rc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is substantially determined by the size of the lamp forming the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that when the incident divergence angle &bgr; is increased, the focal length fc is reduced. On the other hand, the magnification ratio M of the microlenses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>M formed on the first MLA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (a constant value defined as the ratio of the illuminating area of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the area of the first MLA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is determined as the ratio of the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the focal length f<highlight><subscript>MLA2 </subscript></highlight>of the microlenses <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>M formed on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the focal length fc of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reduced in order to increase the divergence angle &bgr;, the focal length f<highlight><subscript>MLA2 </subscript></highlight>of the microlenses <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>M formed on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> must also be reduced. When the focal length f<highlight><subscript>MLA2 </subscript></highlight>is reduced, the distance between the MLA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is also reduced, so that the overall size of the optical system can be reduced. Accordingly, the size of the housing of the optical system can also be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when D is the effective diameter of a single microlens in the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, only the light beams which are incident on the area whose size is D/2 can be subjected to the polarization-conversion process of the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> due to the construction of the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in order to improve the light-receiving efficiency of the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the size of the light-source images on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the diameter of the light beams incident on the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are preferably reduced. The size of the light-source images on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generally expressed by the arc length of the lamp forming the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the distance between the reflection mirror and the arc of in light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (arc-reflection mirror distance) as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is understood that when the incident divergence angle &bgr; is increased and the focal length f<highlight><subscript>MLA2 </subscript></highlight>is reduced, the size of the light-source images on the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is also reduced. Therefore, the light-receiving efficiencies of the second MLA <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the PS composite element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are improved and the optical output of the overall illumination system positioned before the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is increased. Accordingly, the amount of light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As described above, by increasing the divergence angle &bgr; of light incident on the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the size of the housing of the optical system can be reduced and the optical output of the overall illuminating system can be increased at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, the positional relationship between the overall focal point of the microlens and the pixel aperture will be described below. In the present invention, the above-described positional relationship is adjusted and the focusing of light at the pixel aperture is controlled, so that a high effective aperture ratio can be obtained even when the aperture ratio is reduced as a result of size-reduction and the increase in precision of the liquid crystal panel. An experiment was performed by using a microlens having parameters shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The results will be explained below. The overall focal length of the microlens and the position of the pixel aperture were changed and the effective aperture ratio was determined. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the microlens used for the experiment, the focal length of the first lens was 59.3 &mgr;m, the focal length of the second lens was 41.4 &mgr;m, the distance between the lenses was 41.4 &mgr;m, the overall focal length was 41.4 &mgr;m, the geometrical aperture ratio was 31%, the F-number of the projection lens was 1.7, and the dot pitch (pitch between the pixels) was 18 &mgr;m&times;18 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C show the results of the experiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows the light-intensity distribution at the aperture in a case in which the microlens having the parameters shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> was used and the overall focal point thereof was at the same position as the pixel aperture. In this case, the effective aperture ratio was 80%. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows the light-intensity distribution at the aperture in a case in which the microlens having the parameters shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> was used and the overall focal point thereof was placed at a position shifted 6 &mgr;m from the pixel aperture toward the light source. All of the dimensions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and the dimensions listed below are the dimensions in air. The amount of shift can also be expressed as a percentage: 6 &mgr;m/41 &mgr;m&times;100&equals;15%. In this case, the effective aperture ratio was 85%. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> shows the result of a case in which the amount of shift is increased to 10 &mgr;m toward the light source. In this case, the effective aperture ratio was 75%. The effective aperture ratio shows the ratio of the light beams passing through the microlens and the pixel aperture and incident on the projection lens to the light beams emitted from the light source and incident on the pixel. The light source images on the second array are clearly shown at the focal point, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, but are blurred at the position 6 &mgr;m away from the focal point, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. However, the spot sizes are almost the same. It is to be noted that when the overall focal point is shifted from the pixel aperture by 6 &mgr;m, the effective light beams that passed through the pixel aperture and the projection lens are increased by about 5%. This means that when the pixel aperture is on the focal plane, a considerable number of effective light beams, which are able to pass through the projection lens, are included in the light beams blocked at the aperture. In addition, it means that when the pixel aperture is shifted from the focal plane by 6 &mgr;m, the effective light beams are collected in the central area. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, when the pixel aperture is shifted from the focal plane by 10 &mgr;m, the number of effective light beams which pass through the projection lens is reduced compared with the case in which the pixel aperture is shifted by 6 &mgr;m since the spot size is increased. In this case, the percentage of the amount of shift relative to the overall focal length is 24%. Accordingly, it is discovered that the effective aperture ratio can be increased by shifting the pixel aperture from the focal plane by more than 10% of the overall focal length. However, there is no advantage in shifting the pixel aperture from the focal plane by a large amount if the effective aperture ratio is reduced, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. The direction to shift the pixel aperture may be either the negative direction in which the pixel aperture moves toward the light source or the positive direction in which the pixel aperture moves away from the light source, and the amount of shift is preferably &plusmn;10% or more of the overall focal length. The above-described results mean that the optimal point with regard to the spot diameter, the distribution of the effective light beams, and the effective aperture ratio is shifted from the overall focal point in accordance with the emission intensity distribution of the light source used. When the amount of shift is optimized, the brightness of the projection liquid crystal display apparatus can be increased. In addition, the incident divergence angle &bgr; can be further increased, so that the light-utilizing efficiency of the illuminating system can be improved. Accordingly, the optical output can be increased and the overall size can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graph showing the relationship between the displacement between the microlens array and the substrate in which the pixel apertures are formed and the optical output. In the graph, the curve connecting the circles represents a case in which the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is applied, wherein the overall focal point of each microlens is shifted from the corresponding pixel apertures by 6 &mgr;m. The curve connecting the triangles represents the comparative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, wherein the overall focal point of each microlens is at the same position as the corresponding pixel aperture. The curve connecting the rectangles represents an example in which the microlens has a single-lens construction instead of the above-described double-lens construction in which a condenser lens and a field lens are combined. As is apparent from the graph, the optical output is reduced as the displacement increases. More specifically, as the displacement increases, the amount of illuminating light which is blocked at the pixel apertures is increased. However, when the double-lens construction is applied and the overall focal point is shifted from the pixel aperture, the optical output is reduced only by a small amount even when the displacement is increased. For example, the optical output is almost constant when the displacement is in the range of &plusmn;1 &mgr;m. The present invention is especially effective when the microlenses are used for a panel which is large relative to the spot diameter at the aperture. According to the present invention, reduction in the optical output caused by the displacement between the microlens array and the substrate in which the pixel apertures are formed can be prevented and variations in quality between devices can be reduced. </paragraph>

The shapes of the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are determined by the difference in refractive indexes at the two boundaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a construction in which n1, ng1, and ng2, that is, the refractive indexes of the resin layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the glass layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and the glass layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, respectively, satisfy n1&gt;ng1 and n1&gt;ng2.

First, the patterns of the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed on the surfaces of two glass substrates, and the two glass substrates are disposed such that they oppose each other. Then, an optical resin (for example, urethane resin, acrylic resin, etc.) for forming the resin layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is injected between the glass substrates. The surfaces of the glass substrates can be processed by using, for example, various etching methods (isotropic etching, anisotropic etching, dry etching, etc.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the constructions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, the resin layers <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are omitted from the opposing substrates.

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> are diagrams showing the modifications regarding the shape of the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M. In addition to the spherical surface shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, the lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may also be formed in an aspherical surface such as an ellipsoidal surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>), a Fresnel surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>), etc. Although the spherical lens is advantageous in that the surface thereof can be easily processed, since the radius of curvature corresponding to the minimum focal length is limited by the dot size, it is difficult to reduce the focal length if the difference between the refractive indexes of the lens surfaces is not sufficient. As is understood from the figures, lenses having the aspherical surface and the Fresnel surface are advantageous for reducing the focal length and ensuring the flatness of the principal surface of the lens. Accordingly, the incident divergence angle &bgr; can be reliably canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram showing another modification of the liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the lens surface serving as a condenser lens is formed in an opposing substrate and the lens surface serving as a field lens is formed in a pixel electrode substrate. The liquid crystal panel according to this modification includes a pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B and an opposing substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A which is disposed at the light incident side of the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B in such a manner that the opposing substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and the pixel electrode substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B oppose each other with a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The opposing substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A includes a glass substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a resin layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>A, a first microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A, and a cover glass <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in that order from the light-incident side.

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The first microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A is formed of an optical resin and includes a plurality of first microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power and serves as a condenser lens.

In addition, the first lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are convex toward the light-incident side (toward the light source). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the first microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A, the second microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B is formed of an optical resin and includes a plurality of second microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged two-dimensionally in correspondence with the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Each microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having positive refractive power and serves as a field lens. Accordingly, the focal point of the second lens surface R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at approximately the same position as the principal point of the first lens surface R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (the first microlens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is different from the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in that each pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A is placed between the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (that is, between the two lens surfaces R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). However, similarly to the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the overall focal point of the two microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shifted from the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. The positional relationship between the overall focal point and the pixel aperture <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A can be controlled by, for example, adjusting the distance between the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the pixel apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and the distance the microlenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>M-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel apertures <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A. It is considered that the effective aperture ratio is improved the most in this modification, although the processing is most difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the modification shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, since the efficiency relative to the aperture is determined by the first lens, which is at a position closer to the light source, the focal length of the first lens is reduced in a range such that the it can be received by the second lens. In addition, the aperture is disposed at the beam waist, which is at a position closer to the light source than the focal point of the first lens, so that the effective aperture ratio can be improved. In this case, the aperture may be disposed at a position shifted from the overall focal point of the microlens toward the light-emission side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications are possible. For example, although only two lens surfaces having power are provided for each dot in the above-described embodiment, three or more lens surfaces having power may also be provided for each dot. In addition, the present invention is not limited to tree-panel projection liquid crystal display apparatuses, and may also be applied to single-panel projection liquid crystal display apparatuses. </paragraph>
