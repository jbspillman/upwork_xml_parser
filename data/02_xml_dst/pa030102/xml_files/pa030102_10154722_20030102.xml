<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a control circuit for an Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS). More particularly, the present invention relates to an ESFAS control circuit utilizing energize to actuate relays to selectively energize ESFAS components. The present invention further relates to a method of testing the energize to actuate ESFAS control circuit to ensure proper operability of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Nuclear power plants generate significant amounts of radioactive products due to the fission process. Thus, a major objective in designing nuclear power plants is to prevent any release of these radioactive fission products. In this regard, nuclear plant designers utilize multiple barriers to the prevention of fission product release. To ensure the integrity of the multiple barriers, the so-called &ldquo;defense-in-depth&rdquo; approach is employed. This approach employs at least three defense mechanisms to preventing fission product release. These three mechanisms include prevention, protection, and mitigation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The prevention mechanism relates to the complete avoidance of events that could ultimately result in fission product release. Thus, robust components and systems, and stringent operating practices are utilized to prevent such events. Of course, even though components and systems are robustly designed, and procedures are fastidiously written, component failures and operational errors inevitably occur. Thus, the protection mechanism relates to those highly unlikely events that result in plant shutdown and could lead to fission product release, despite the prevention mechanism. Any conceivable component, system, and operator failure is analyzed to ensure appropriate protective measures are in place to effectively protect against such events. The mitigation mechanism relates to those events that could result in severe core damage and significant fission product release, despite the prevention and protection mechanisms. Highly unlikely events that result in core damage are postulated, and systems are designed to mitigate the effects of such events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One of the systems utilized to mitigate severe core damaging events is the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) system. The ESF system includes components to ensure rapid core shutdown, and continued core cooling to limit fuel damage and fission product release to the reactor vessel and containment. The ESF system further includes components to ensure continued integrity of the containment building should any fission products be released from the fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Many ESF systems utilize an Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) to selectively actuate individual ESF components. Usually, an ESFAS is designed with component relays to actuate one or more components. In this design, the component actuation relays are configured to be normally energized, and de-energize to actuate the particular component(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The so-called de-energize to actuate design discussed above requires the component actuation relays to be continuously energized. This continuous energization has caused numerous ESFAS relay failures, many of which have failed in a non-conservative (e.g., non-actuate) state. Moreover, while it seems fairly intuitive that the de-energize to actuate design provides an inherent &ldquo;fail-safe&rdquo; design feature should power be lost to the ESFAS, the fact is, that if power is lost to the ESFAS, it is likely lost to the particular components, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art to provide an ESFAS that eliminates the failure mechanisms associated with continuous relay energization. There is also a need to provide an ESFAS that eliminates this failure mechanism without jeopardizing the defense-in-depth design of the nuclear power plant. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, a component actuation circuit for an engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS) includes a plurality of coincidence logic contacts, and a plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays. Each of the coincidence logic contacts closes in response to a command signal. The plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays are connected in series between at least two of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. Closure of at least two of the coincidence logic contacts energizes the parallel-connected ESFAS component relays, thereby energizing a plurality of ESFAS components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a component actuation circuit for a nuclear power plant engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS), includes ESFAS component actuation means, and coincidence logic means. The ESFAS component actuation means selectively actuates a plurality of ESFAS components. The coincidence logic means selectively connects/disconnects a power source to/from the ESFAS component actuation means in accordance with a minimally 2-of-4 coincidence logic scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the present invention, a method of continuously monitoring the operability of each of a plurality of parallel-connected relays includes connecting equivalent resistance elements in series on both sides of the plurality of parallel-connected relays. The equivalent resistance elements are connected to a power source, and a voltage drop across each of the equivalent resistance elements is monitored. The equivalent resistances each exhibit an electrical resistance sufficiently high to prevent any of the plurality of parallel-connected relays from energizing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the present invention, method of testing coil continuity of a plurality of parallel-connected, normally de-energized relays includes sequentially series-connecting each of the relays to (1) a resistance element and (2) a power source having a predetermined voltage level. A voltage drop across the resistance element is monitored. The resistance element exhibits an electrical resistance sufficiently high to prevent each of said relays from fully energizing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In yet a further aspect of the present invention, a method of testing the contacts in a circuit including a plurality of parallel-connected relays and a plurality of parallel-connected contacts connected in series with the plurality of parallel-connected relays includes shutting one of the contacts and series-connecting the shut contact to a power source via a first resistance element. A voltage drop across the shut contact is monitored. A contact resistance of the shut contact is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In yet still a further aspect of the present invention, a method of individually testing the operability of each of a plurality of parallel-connected component actuation relays includes series-connecting one of the component actuation relays to a power source via a component test contact and a resistance element. Proper operation of one or more components controlled by the component actuation relay connected to the power source is verified. These steps are then repeated for each of the plurality of parallel-connected component actuation relays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the present invention, a component actuation circuit for an engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS) includes a plurality of coincidence logic contacts and a plurality of ESFAS component relays connected in parallel with one another. The coincidence logic contacts are connected to a power source, and each of the coincidence logic contacts closes in response to a command signal. The parallel-connected ESFAS component relays are connected in series between at least two of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. At least one diode on both sides of each of the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays are connected in series with each of the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays. At least one lockout contact is connected in series with the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays, and in parallel with at least one of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. A lockout relay is connected in parallel with the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays, and closes the at least one lockout contact, thereby maintaining the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays energized. A plurality of manually initiated contacts is connected in series with the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays, and in parallel with at least one of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. A plurality of resistance elements is connected (1) in series with the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays and (2) in parallel with at least one of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. The resistance elements exhibit an electrical resistance sufficiently high to prevent the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays from energizing when the plurality of coincidence logic contacts are open. At least one test relay contact is connected in series with each of the plurality of parallel-connected ESFAS component relays, and in parallel with at least one of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts. At least one limiting resistor and a diode test contact are connected in series with the at least one test relay contact. A test resistor is connected in series with the at least one test relay contact. A monitoring circuit is connected in parallel with the test resistor. At least one load test resistor and a load test contact are connected in series with at least one of the plurality of resistance elements. At least one monitoring circuit is connected in parallel with at least one of the plurality of resistance elements. An alarm circuit is connected to the at least one monitoring circuit. The alarm circuit generates an alarm when the monitoring circuit senses an abnormal condition. Closure of at least two of the plurality of coincidence logic contacts, or at least two of the plurality of manually initiated contacts, energizes the plurality of ESFAS component relays, thereby energizing one or more EFSAS components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides distinct features and advantages over related ESFAS designs. Specifically, the use of energize to actuate component actuation relays provides increased reliability and extended relay lifetime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for continuous passive monitoring and periodic active monitoring of the ESFAS to assure proper continuity of the entire ESFAS when in a non-actuate mode. Thus, a full simultaneous actuation of an entire ESF function is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art when the following detailed description is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the following description, use of the terms above and below refer to the spatial orientation with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is to be understood that these spatial orientation terms are used solely to facilitate the following description and not to describe the actual spatial configuration of any of the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts the basic elements of an ESFAS energize to actuate circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a single ESFAS function, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The number of component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not limiting, and will vary according to the particular ESFAS function being controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected in series with a plurality of coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are normally closed (NC), energize-to-open type of contacts. Thus, the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are open during normal operation, and are closed upon de-energization of associated coincidence logic relays (not shown). The skilled artisan will appreciate that the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could be normally open, energize-to-close contacts which close upon energization of the associated logic relays. However, inherent fail-safe design criteria may dictate the preferred configuration. Additionally, in the preferred embodiment, two coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected in parallel above, and two coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected below, the parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are energized only when at least one coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> above and below the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are closed. The logic of the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is therefore a selective 2-out-of-4 scheme. This logic scheme ensures that no single coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> failure will either cause an inadvertent ESFAS actuation, or prevent a legitimate ESFAS actuation from occurring. It will occur to the skilled artisan that this coincidence scheme and coincidence logic contact arrangement and number is not limiting, but could include other numbers, arrangements and schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A manual initiation contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel with each of the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be operated either remotely, locally, or both. As with the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, closure of a manual initiation contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on both sides of the component actuation relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is required to energize the relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be realized from any one of various components including, but not limited to, one or more rotary switches, pusbutton switches, software switches, relay contacts, or other known devices known to the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A lockout relay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel with the plurality of parallel-connected component actuation relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lockout relay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> controls the operation of one or more lockout contacts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected in parallel with the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> above and below the parallel-connected component actuation relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A lockout reset switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected in series with each lockout contact <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The lockout reset switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is realized using separate switches, or a single multi-contact switch. Operation of the lockout relay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, lockout contacts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and lockout reset switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An upper diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a lower diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are connected in series with each component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The diodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are connected to conduct when a legitimate ESFAS actuation occurs, thus allowing the component relays to energize. The diodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are placed in the circuit to facilitate testing, which is described further below. Preferably, a single upper diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is series-connected above each component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a single lower diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is series-connected below each component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, the skilled artisan will appreciate that more than one upper and lower diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> could be connected above and below the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Redundant power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, including a common return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, are used to supply power to each ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are auctioneered, though this is not a limiting design feature of the invention. The power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> service more than one ESFAS function circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, each circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be designed to include its own set of redundant power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes several components that facilitate continuous and/or automatic testing of the circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its various components. These components include two passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> connected, one each, above and below the parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are also connected in parallel with the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and lockout contacts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected on the same side of the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as the passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The upper passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected between the power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the upper diodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected between the common return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the lower diodes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to each of the passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. While two passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are depicted, it will be appreciated that these elements could be made up of a plurality of elements to achieve the desired resistance value. Additionally, although resistors are schematically represented, the skilled artisan will appreciate that other components could be used to exhibit the desired value of resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The test components further include a plurality of component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which are normally open during normal ESFAS operation. A single test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is associated with each of the parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is electrically connected at one end between each component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its associated lower diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are electrically connected at their other ends to a common connection point between a second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a series-connected lower diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and third resistance element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The series-connected lower diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and third resistance element are connected at its upper end to the power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is connected at its lower end to the power supply return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. A monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected across the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the test components include two sets of a series connected load test contact <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and load test resistance <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The upper load test contact <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and resistance <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> set are series-connected between the power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The lower load test contact <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and resistance <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> set are series-connected between the power supply return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the upper passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During normal operations, the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, manual contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and lockout contacts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are open. Thus, the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are de-energized. If control and monitoring equipment (not depicted) determine that an ESF function is necessary, coincidence logic relays (not depicted) will be de-energized causing the coincidence logic relays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to close. As a result, a low resistance current path is established between the power supplies <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, through the coincidence logic relays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the upper and lower diodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the power supply return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The energized component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> cause ESF components to begin operating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Simultaneous with the above, current also flows through the lockout relay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When lockout relay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> energizes, this causes lockout contacts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to close. Thus, the current path through the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is locked in, even if the coincidence logic relays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> subsequently open. Hence, to reset the ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to its normal configuration, lockout reset switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must be operated to interrupt the current path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Similar operations occur if an operator determines that an ESF function is needed and manually initiates the ESFAS by closing the manual contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Because this ESFAS operates on the energize to actuate principle, it is important that operability of circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is frequently determined. This is because particular open circuit faults in the actuation logic would be more difficult to detect than in a conventional de-energize to actuate circuit. It is further important that the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> be tested under full load conditions, since simple verification of contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> closure does not verify that it can carry the current load necessary to energize the parallel-connected component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The testing and monitoring of the ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes a four pronged approach. The first includes continuous passive monitoring of critical system voltage levels. The second includes automatic (or manually initiated) periodic continuity testing. The third includes automatic (or manually initiated/assisted) simulated load testing. And the fourth includes individual component actuation testing. Each of these tests will be described hereinafter in more detail. It will be understood, of course, that the test methodology outlined herein is not limiting, but is only the preferred test methodology for the preferred circuit. Other testing features and methodology will be apparent to the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Continuous passive monitoring is conducted using the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the corresponding monitoring circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, under the control of a microprocessor (not depicted). It should be noted that the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are of equivalent resistance values, and have a sufficient resistance to ensure current flow through the component actuation relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is insufficient to energize the relays. Of course, the resistance values are also small enough to detect circuit abnormalities. In the preferred embodiment, the resistance values would be approximately 10 K-ohm, but the skilled artisan will appreciate that other values can be chosen. Since the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are of equivalent resistances, under normal circuit operation each will drop approximately half of the power supply 28 voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a simple flowchart of the basic testing sequence (<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) for the continuous passive monitoring test. During the test, the magnitude of the voltage drops across each of the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is sensed via the corresponding monitoring circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and compared to a predetermined limit (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). If the magnitude of the voltage drops is outside the limit, this indicates an abnormality and an alarm is sounded (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). For example, if the resistance of one of the upper coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> decreases to about 100 K-ohm, the voltage drop across the upper passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will decrease approximately 10%. There will also be a concomitant increase in the voltage drop across the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> under this circumstance. Additionally, an abnormal condition that could pose a testing hazard will inhibit further automatic testing. Then, a predetermined time delay is initiated (<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) before the process repeats (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). Thus, with this test sequence (<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), continuous passive monitoring of the continuity of the ESFAS circuit is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The automatic (or manually initiated) periodic continuity test is accomplished by sequentially closing each of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This sequential contact closure can be done automatically under microprocessor control, or manually by an operator, while the ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a non-actuate condition. Preferably, however, it is performed by a microprocessor. The test sequence (<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>), depicted summarily in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, begins by setting a variable (N) equal to one (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). Then, one of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). Closing a component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connects the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in parallel with the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Since the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a resistance value significantly less than the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, it effectively shunts the lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. For example, in the preferred embodiment, the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a resistance value of 20 ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next, the magnitude of the voltage drop across the upper resistance <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is monitored (<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). Since the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is small compared to the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, nearly all of the power supply <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> voltage should drop across the upper passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, a determination is made whether the voltage drop is approximately the full power supply <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> voltage. If it is not, the condition may indicate an open upper diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or component relay coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and it is alarmed (<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that the value of the upper passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, even with the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the circuit, is sufficiently high to prevent the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from fully energizing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If approximately full supply voltage is sensed across the upper resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the lower diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). This places the third resistance element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into the circuit to form a voltage divider with the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which allows testing of the lower blocking diodes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The third resistance element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a resistance value significantly smaller than the upper and lower passive monitoring resistance elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. More specifically, in the preferred embodiment the third resistance element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is selected to have a resistance value slightly less than a component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Next, the voltage drop across lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is monitored (<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>) and if it is not within a specified range limit an alarm is generated (<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>). Specifically, the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected across lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> should sense a voltage drop of approximately one diode drop less than the voltage drop sensed by the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> connected across the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. If the lower blocking diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> under test is open, the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will not detect any voltage change. If the upper blocking diode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is shorted, and the lower blocking diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is open, then the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will detect an intermediate voltage value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, then the individual component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is opened (<highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>), and the variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is incremented by one (<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>). The variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is then compared to a predetermined value &ldquo;NR&rdquo; to determine whether all of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been closed (<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>). If so, then the diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is opened (<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>), and a test interval time delay (<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>) is initiated before repeating the test (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). If not all of the component actuation contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been sequentially closed, the test sequence (<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>) returns to implement the test for the next component actuation contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The previous testing sequences (<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>) verify proper voltage and continuity during ESFAS standby operation. The simulated load testing and individual component actuation testing verify the ability of the ESFAS circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to perform its required function under simulated load conditions. The simulated load testing sequentially closes each coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, applies a simulated load to the contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and calculates its contact resistance. Specifically, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the simulated load testing sequence <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is depicted. Initially, a variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is set to equal one (<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>). Then, one of the coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). Although not depicted in the test sequence, it will be appreciated that closure of a coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will short either the upper or lower passive monitoring resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, depending on which contact is being tested. Thus, the particular monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will sense zero voltage drop across the closed coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> under no-load conditions. Thereafter, a determination is made as to whether the variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is less than three (<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>). If &ldquo;N&rdquo; is less than three then the upper load test contact <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>), if &ldquo;N&rdquo; is not less than three then the lower load test contact <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). It will be appreciated that the number that &ldquo;N&rdquo; is compared to can vary depending on the number of coincidence logic contacts incorporated into the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Closure of the upper or lower load test contact <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> places one of the load test resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> into the circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The load test resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are low value, high wattage resistance elements that are sized to simulate full load conditions across individual coincidence test contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the lower load test contact <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is closed, full load current will flow through the closed coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and through the lower load test contact <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the upper resistance element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects any change in voltage drop across the coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the the resistance of the closed coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is calculated therefrom (<highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The calculated coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> resistance is then compared to a predetermined setpoint (<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>). If the resistance exceeds a setpoint, the condition is alarmed (<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>). If the resistance is less than the setpoint, or after the condition is alarmed, the coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> under test is opened (<highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>), variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is incremented by one (<highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>), and the load test contact <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is opened (<highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>). The variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is then checked to determine whether it exceeds the number of coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which in the preferred embodiment is four (<highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>). If not, the test repeats for the next coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and if so, the entire sequence (<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>) is repeated after a test interval time delay (<highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the above-described simulated load testing can also be performed for each manual initiation contact <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To do so requires operator action to close the manual initiation contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It should be further noted that during the simulated load testing, the ESFAS is fully operational, and capable of responding to a legitimate ESFAS actuation command. Moreover, no failure of a component will either cause or prevent a legitimate ESFAS actuation during the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The final test, the sequence (<highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>) of which is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, individually tests the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to verify operability of the component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts in the equipment controlled by the component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Unlike the preceding tests, this test requires manual intervention by operators in order to verify the component is actuated and to manually shut off the actuated component when the individual test is complete. A time delay is implemented between sequential component relay <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tests to allow components to reposition to the non-actuate state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The particular components used in this test depend upon which coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are being operated. Initially, the test is manually initiated (<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) by closing one of the upper coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). One of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is then closed (<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>), sending current through one of the component relays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Then, similar to the previously described test, the coil resistance of the component relay is calculated (<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A determination is then made as to whether the calculated coil resistance is acceptable (<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>), and if not an alarm is annunciated (<highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>). Then, an operator verifies that the controlled component has actually actuated (<highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>) and that the actuation is acceptable (<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>). If the actuation is not acceptable, the operator takes appropriate action and logs the failure (<highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>). In any event, the operator then takes action to open the closed component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>), reset the actuated component (<highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>), and verify that the component has acceptably reset (<highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>). If the component has not reset properly, the operator takes appropriate action and logs the failure (<highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is then incremented by one (<highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>), and compared to the value &ldquo;NR&rdquo; to determine whether all of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been sequentially closed (<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>). If not, the reset time delay is initiated (<highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>) and the sequence is conducted for the next component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>). If all of the component actuation test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been closed in sequence, then the upper coincidence logic contacts are opened (<highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>) and the next portion of the test is conducted (<highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The next portion of the test, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, tests the lower blocking diodes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> under simulated load conditions. First, one of the lower coincidence logic contacts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>). Then, the lower diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>). The variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is again set to the value of one (<highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>), and a component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is closed (<highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>). Thus, a simulated full load current is supplied through third resistance element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the closed component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a lower blocking diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the closed coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are in parallel with the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The voltage across the second resistance element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, monitored by the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, is checked to determine whether or not it is acceptable (<highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>). An acceptable voltage is a single diode voltage drop, due to conduction of the lower blocking diode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. If the voltage is not acceptable, an alarm is sounded (<highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In any event, the component actuation test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is then opened (<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>), variable &ldquo;N&rdquo; is incremented by one (<highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>), and &ldquo;NR&rdquo; is compared to determine whether all of the test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been sequentially closed (<highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>). If all of the test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have not been sequentially closed, the sequence is repeated for the next test contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>). If all of the test contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been sequentially closed, the lower coincidence logic contact <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>) and the lower diode test contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are opened (<highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight>), and the test is completed (<highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in detail, it is apparent that modifications and adaptations of the preferred embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. However, it will be expressly understood that such modifications and adaptations are within the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
