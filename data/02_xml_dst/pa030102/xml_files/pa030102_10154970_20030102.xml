<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-159449, Filed May 28, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a fixing mechanism which fixes a toner image (image) on a fixation member in an image forming apparatus such as an electro-static process copying machine or a laser printer, and more particularly to a fixing mechanism using an induction heating method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A fixing mechanism incorporated in a copying apparatus using an electrophotographic process heats and fuses toner which is a developer formed on a fixation member and fixes the toner on the fixation member. As a method for heating the toner which can be used in the fixing mechanism, a method using radiant heat from a halogen lamp is widely utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the method using the halogen lamp as a heat source, there is extensively used a structure in which a pair of rollers are provided so as to be capable of providing a predetermined pressure to the fixation member and the toner and a cylindrical halogen lamp is arranged in an inner space of at least one of the rollers as a hollow cylinder. In this structure, the roller having the halogen lamp arranged therein forms an action portion (nip) at a position where it is brought into contact with the other roller and provides the pressure and heat to the fixation member and the toner guided to the nip. That is, the fixation member, namely, paper is passed through a fixation point which is a pressure welding portion (nip) between a heating roller to which the lamp is provided and a pressure roller which rotates in accordance with the heating roller, and the toner on the paper is fused and then fixed onto the paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the fixing mechanism using the halogen lamp, light and heat from the halogen lamp are radiated in the circumferential direction of the heating roller and the entire heating roller is heated. In this case, taking the loss when light is converted into heat and the efficiency or the like when warming the air in the roller and transmitting the heat to the roller into consideration, the heat exchange effectiveness is 60 to 70%. Further, it is known that the heat efficiency is low, the power consumption is large and the warming-up time is prolonged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the above-described problems inherent to the heater fixation, as shown in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 9-258586 or Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-76620, there is proposed a fixing mechanism using a technique of induction heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 9-258586 discloses a fixing mechanism which passes a current to an induction coil obtained by winding a coil around a core provided along a rotational axis of a fixing (metal) roller and generating an induction current to the roller in order to heat the metal roller itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-76620 discloses a fixing mechanism which has a conductive film accommodating therein magnetic field generating means and a pressure roller appressed against the conductive film and fixes the toner on a recording medium carried between the conductive film and the pressure roller onto the recording medium by causing the conductive film to generate heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of reducing the warming-up time, in the fixing mechanism having a thinner heat roller or the fixing mechanism which adopts a belt or the like, a temperature histerisis distribution is apt to appear on the heat roller depending on a size of the paper inserted and only a part through which the paper has passed consumes the heat energy. Therefore, irregularities in temperature are generated, and hence temperature control or a partial heating method which does not depend on the paper size is required in the fixing apparatus to which induction heating is applied in particular. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A pressure roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is in contact with a predetermined position on an outer peripheral surface of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a non-illustrated pressure applying mechanism. As a result, a predetermined contact width, namely, a nip is defined between the pressure roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, since the pressure roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a predetermined pressure, the pressure roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> rotates in accordance with (heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) rotation of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A fixation material P is passed through the nip between the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the pressure roller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, at this moment, an image, i.e., toner is fixed onto the fixation material P by the Joule heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, iron having an outside diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1.0 mm is used for the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When such a heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a small wall thickness and a small heat capacity is used, a surface temperature of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> greatly varies depending on a size of the fixation member, namely, paper passed through the nip between the rollers. Therefore, the heat energy must be replenished in a short time to a part where the temperature is greatly lowered. However, it is known that irregularities in temperature (increase in temperature at a part where no paper is passed) become prominent in the rotational axis direction (longitudinal direction) of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the temperature of the roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled by controlling power supplied to the coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to be capable of replenishing the heat energy over the entire area of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The central coil and the both end coils of the electromagnetic induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> are so-called solenoid type coils each of which is wound around the center of the rotational axis of the heat roller. The two end coils of the electromagnetic induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> are solenoid type coils and the central coil of the same is a so-called spiral planar coil which extends in the longitudinal direction. The central coil and the two end coils of the electromagnetic induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> are planar coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> All the electromagnetic induction coils shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C are air coils, as they do not have a magnetic substance core. The air coil can achieve reduction in weight since it does not have a heavy magnetic substance core, and the heat generation efficiency of the air coil is not lowered because it does not have a problem of a Curie point that the magnetic substance core has. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In order to bring out the necessary coil performance by using the air coil, a large current must be caused to flow. Therefore, an electric wire material used for the induction coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must have a thickness (cross-sectional area) which can withstand the large current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When a frequency of power supplied is higher than a predetermined frequency due to the well-known skin effect even if a thick electric wire is used, however, it is difficult to assure an apparent (effective) cross-sectional area of the electric wire material. Thus, as the electric wire material forming the coil, there is used a Litz wire obtained by individually insulating and coating thin single-line wire materials on which a penetration depth of the skin effect does not have an impact and twisting the wires which can assure a predetermined cross-sectional area. In the fixing mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the wire obtained by twisting <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> heat-resistant enamel wires (polyimide coated) each having a diameter of 0.5 mm is used for each induction coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> except the case which will be additionally described hereunder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The induction coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has an entire length of 320 mm.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> That is, in an electrophotographic type copying machine or a printer apparatus which is extensively used as an image forming apparatus, an image forming condition by which a number of times of printing output becomes maximum is that the paper of A4 size is carried with a short side (width: 210 mm) direction being in a direction orthogonal to a direction along which the paper is carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this case, even if only the central coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is operated, at least 210 mm alone must be capable of increasing the temperature. Incidentally, since heat is passed to the both end portions in the longitudinal direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> due to thermodiffusion of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the length of the central coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in the axial direction is set to a length that a magnetic field generated by the central coil can increase the temperature in the vicinity of the center in the longitudinal direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a width of approximately 230 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, the respective coil electric wires are wound around supports <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>having various kinds of shapes.

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, coil electric wires can be fixed on the surfaces of the supports <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>by applying silicon-based varnish, thereby suppressing vibrations of the coils or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described above, the induction coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of pieces along the longitudinal direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and at least one of the divided coils is determined as an air coil, thereby inexpensively forming the induction coil with a light weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E illustrate examples of an electromagnetic induction coil which can be applied to the fixing mechanism depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in which the coil electric wire of the three air coils divided in the longitudinal direction is set to an angle inclined to the rotational axis direction of the heat roller from the vertical direction by a predetermined angle. It is to be noted that reference numeral add up denotes structures which are identical with or similar to those in the induction coil explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, thereby omitting the detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the three coils divided in the longitudinal direction explained in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, each divided coil can be energized according to needs and temperature control can be performed. However, when all the coils are simultaneously energized or when the central coil and the coils on the both ends are alternately energized considering the upper limit of power which can be inputted, it is confirmed that heat generation is lowered at a joint between the respective divided coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When heat generation is lowered at the joint in this manner, it is known that a difference in fixation ratio is generated at the joint portion or gloss on the surface of the outputted paper is changed. Moreover, wrinkles may be produced when a difference is generated to such an extent that the paper is extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the induction coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is divided into three coils, i.e., the central coil <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the two end coils <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and the electric wire of each coil is inclined to the rotational axis direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the vertical direction by a predetermined angle, which is 30&deg; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, when it is wound. An angle by which the electric wire material should be inclined is such an angle as that the cut line of the coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> cannot be seen when viewing in a direction parallel to the longitudinal direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, it is set to 5&deg; or 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, each turn of the respective coils <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is wound while being inclined by a predetermined angle as described above.

In the induction coil depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, each turn of the central coil <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is staggered in the vertical direction, while each turn of the both end coils <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is inclined by a predetermined angle. In the induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D, a</cross-reference> length of one coil of the central coil <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>including two planar coils is defined to be longer than that of the other coil. Similarly, a length of each coil of the both end coils <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>including two planar coils is defined to be opposite to the length of the central coil. In the induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>E, the central coil <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>staggers positions of the upper coil and the lower coil, and the coil length of the upper coil of the end coil <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is smaller whilst the coil length of the lower coil of the same is smaller. In this structure, the coil length of the upper coil of the end coil <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is large, while the coil length of the lower coil of the same is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> By winding the electric wire material as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E in case of winding the electric wire material, a heat generation length of each coil partially differs in the longitudinal direction of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, although a temperature lowers at the joint portion, positions of the joints do not match with each other in the axial direction when the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is rotated. Thus, in the winding method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, although reduction in temperature up to 30&deg; C. occurs at the joint portion, this reduction can be suppressed within 10&deg; C. As a result, it is possible to suppress generation of a difference in fixation ratio at the joint part or a change in gloss on the surface of the outputted paper, and wrinkles can be prevented from being produced due to occurrence of a difference to such an extent as that the paper is extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E, respective coil electric wires are wound around the supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>having various kinds of shapes.

Further, if not all the coils are air coils and a coil having the magnetic substance core is included, or if all the coils have the magnetic substance cores, a similar effect can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> illustrate examples of an electromagnetic induction coil which can be applied to the fixing mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in which a magnetic substance core of the air coil divided into three in the longitudinal direction is set at an angle inclined to the rotation axis direction of the heat roller from the vertical direction by a predetermined angle. It is to be noted that reference numerals with &ldquo;20&rdquo; added thereto denote structures similar or equal to those of the induction coils described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, thereby omitting a detailed explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the induction coil is divided into to three coils, i.e., a central coil <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and two end coils <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and cores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>constituted by the magnetic substance are inclined at a predetermined angle to the rotational axis direction of the heat roller to the axial direction. Although the inclination angle is not restricted to a specific angle, an angle ranging from 5&deg; to 60&deg; is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The induction coil according to this embodiment is different from the examples described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E, and it is a coil having the magnetic substance core. It is to be noted that coils which have the same shape and are wound in the axial direction of the heat roller are used for the respective coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As bobbins of the magnetic substance cores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, they must have the heat resistance, and polyimide, heat-resistant phenol, liquid crystal polymer or the like may be used. The coil electric wire can be fixed by applying silicon-based varnish on the surface of this bobbin, thereby suppressing vibrations of the coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the coil shape is not restricted to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and a similar advantage can be expected if the end portions of the adjacent magnetic substance cores are inclined at the same angle. For example, providing an angle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> can obtain the similar advantage. Alternatively, a shape obtained by combining the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> with that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> can suffice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, all the coils includes at least one of the type having the magnetic substance core and at least one of the air coil is included, the similar advantage can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the induction coils shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the coil is configured to be divided into a plurality of coils, and the core consisting of the magnetic substance is configured to have an angle inclined from a direction vertical to the rotational axis direction of the heat roller by a predetermined angle. Therefore, even if all the divided coils are energized in order to cope with the paper of a large size, reduction in heat generation at the joints of the coils can be suppressed. As a result, it is possible to suppress generation of wrinkles or the like due to a difference in fixation ratio at the joint parts, a difference in degree of gloss on an image surface and a difference in extension of a paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E illustrate examples of the shape which can be applied to the fixing mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in which at least one of the upper and lower end portions of the magnetic substance core of the air coil divided into three in the longitudinal direction in the vicinity of the joint is caused to protrude.

By providing such a shape of the end portion of each core, the magnetic flux slightly extends from the end portion of the coil toward the heat roller as compared with the case where the end portion is not caused to protrude. As a result, parts with the low magnetic flux density are decreased at the end portions of the respective coils, thereby suppressing reduction in heat generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although the protruding length of the end portion of each core is not particularly restricted, a length ranging from approximately 2 mm to 10 mm is preferable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates the drive device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, the induction coil is divided into a central coil <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and both end coils <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and the both end coils <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>among these coils are driven by the same control mode or same condition (since they are connected in series). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As a coil driving mode, i.e., a method of supplying power to individual coils, there can be considered a method which energizes all the coils during the warming-up and switches a coil to be driven (target to which power is supplied) by the control according to needs in any other case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Presuming that all the coils are simultaneously energized at the time of warming-up, an output which can be allowed to the fixing mechanism is a sum of outputs from the central coil <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the both end coils <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. It is to be noted that the output indicates a power conversion value outputted from each coil in order to provide the magnetic flux to generate an eddy current, which is a heat source of the heat roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, from each coil to the heat roller, and substantially corresponds to power consumption consumed by the coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> For example, it is assumed that power available as a heat source of the fixing mechanism is up to 1400 W during the warming-up when any other machine parts of a copying machine are all not operating and it is 900 W at the time of copying (image formation). In this case, an output from the central coil <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is up to 700 W, and outputs from the both end coils <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are 700 W in total. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> A frequency of each coil is usually variable and these coils are mainly operated with the same timing. However, when a plurality of coils are simultaneously driven, the buzzing is generated due to a small difference in frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The buzzing generated by switching a coil as a drive target (coil to which the power is supplied) can be prevented by using a half bridge mode which is forcible oscillation. However, a number of switching elements is increased for example, which leads to increase in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in regard to each of a plurality of the coils, a maximum value of the output allowed for the heating source of the fixing mechanism is determined as 1400 W with respect to the central coil and the both end coils during the warming-up, and these coils are alternately driven (coil to which the power is supplied is switched). Then, the output of 1400 W does not fluctuate. Further, at the time of copying, by setting each frequency variable and adjusting the output, the allowable maximum output can be used for heating a part which requires the heat roller. In this case, the drive circuit can utilize the semi-E class mode which is inexpensive self-excited oscillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> At this moment, since a range of the frequency which can oscillate is restricted in induction heating, it is necessary to design in such a manner that each coil can obtained the same output at substantially the same frequency in order to extensively use the output range by a plurality of the coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> For the above-described reason, in this embodiment according to the present invention, the coil constant of each coil is set so as to obtain the output of 700 W to 1400 W in the frequency range of 20 kHz to 40 kHz when 100 V is used as a power supply voltage. The upper limit of the output from each coil is substantially the same, and this is a maximum value which can be supplied to the fixing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Concretely, for example, assuming that a sum of outputs from the central coil and the both end coils is 1400 W with a frequency of approximately 21 kHz, the sum becomes 700 W at a frequency of approximately 39 kHz. An error of the inductance of the coils must be restricted to approximately &plusmn;30 &mgr;H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, when the central coil and the both end coils are alternately driven, the respective coils must not be simultaneously energized. Furthermore, when a difference in output of the individual coils is greater than a predetermined level, the voltage may drop in the same commercial power supply circuit. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B, a</cross-reference> plurality of the coils are switched at the time of alternate energization with a difference in output being not more than 200 W, zero cross, and an interval in switching being not more than 0 to 20 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> By performing these controls by using a microcomputer, the timing operation during the alternate operation can be smoothly conducted. Moreover, even if the magnetic characteristic of the heat roller or the coil characteristic varies due to a change in temperature of the heat roller (by controlling using the single microcomputer) and the oscillation condition diverges, the smooth control can be enabled. This can simplify the control system and also decrease the cost as compared with the case of using a plurality of the microcomputers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the respective coils are alternately energized, it is convenient to use a method which gradually lowers the frequency (soft start) without suddenly raising to a predetermined output with a variable frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, it is also possible to use a method which passes a current with a predetermined frequency, calculates the power and then adjusts the output by controlling the frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is also possible to determine a frequency and an output based on the conditions of the previous energization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The above-described soft start is managed within 0.5 second from a point in time when the power is supplied to a coil to which the power should be supplied. Thereafter, a frequency is determined based on the conditions of the previous energization, respectively. The output is detected and corrected. It is to be noted that the output is detected by detecting the inputted voltage and current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in this embodiment according to the present invention, the drive circuit which supplies predetermined power to each coil in the fixing mechanism includes one power supply portion (circuit which smoothes the alternating current to the direct current) and a plurality of oscillation portions for the respective coils. They are controlled by one microcomputer as described above. Incidentally, although the semi-E class circuit is used as the drive circuit, the similar advantage can be obtained when the half bridge or full bridge mode is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> temperature of the heat roller which generates heat when each coil is energized is detected by a thermistor provided at a position corresponding to the coil of the heat roller, and a temperature of the coil itself is detected by temperature detecting means, respectively. It is to be noted that the heat generation status is monitored and a thermostat is also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Since an energization time of each coil in alternate energization can be constantly switched since the consumption status of the thermal energy and the temperature are detected by the above-described temperature detecting means. However, for example, some drive patterns may be defined in advance and any pattern may be selected based on the operation status of the copying machine main body (for example, in the warming-up, in the copying, in the copying of the small-size paper and in the ready mode) and a temperature detected by the temperature detecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As examples of the patterns, there are two-second energization to the central coil&plus;one-second energization to the both end coils, two-second energization to the central coil&plus;0.5-second energization to the both end coils, and others. Furthermore, since a temperature of each coil is detected as a temperature of the heat roller at a corresponding position, it is possible to energize the coil whose detected temperature is low. In this case, it is needless to say that the upper and lower limits of the set temperature must be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the drive circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is substantially equivalent to the drive circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> That is, the drive circuit includes a power supply portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> as a circuit which smoothes the alternating current to the direct current, and a plurality of oscillation portions for the respective coils, i.e., first and second switching circuits <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. They are controlled by one microcomputer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as described above. Incidentally, although the semi-E class circuit is used for the drive circuit, the similar advantage can be obtained when the half bridge or full bridge mode is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, although already described, when the central coil (a) and the both end coils (b, c) are alternately driven, namely, when the power is alternately supplied to the coil (a) and the coils (b, c), the individual coils must not be simultaneously energized. Furthermore, when a difference in output from the individual coils is greater than a predetermined level, the voltage may drop in the same commercial power supply circuit every time the coil as a target to which the power is supplied is switched. Therefore, as already described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B, a</cross-reference> difference in output of the individual coils at the time of alternate energization is set to 200 W, namely, not more than 20% of 1400 W. Incidentally, as the timing for switching the coil to be energized, i.e., the timing at which the coil to which the power is supplied is switched, there is used zero cross with which the polarity of the alternating output before rectifying the input power supply (commercial power supply) is counterchanged. In this case, an interval of energization at the time of switching is not more than 0 to 20 msec with respect to the zero cross. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> By controlling these members by the single microcomputer which is independently provided for temperature control of the fixing mechanism, the timing operation at the time of alternate operation can be smoothly conducted. Moreover, even if the magnetic characteristic of the heat roller or the coil characteristic varies due to a change in temperature of the heat roller and the oscillation condition, i.e., an output of each coil varies by the control of the single microcomputer, the smooth control can be enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In addition, as apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> temperature of the heat roller which generates heat when each coil is energized is detected by the thermistors <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> provided at positions corresponding to the coils of the heat roller, and a temperature of the coil itself is detected by an inner thermistor <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, respectively. It is to be noted that the heat generation status is monitored and there is also provided a thermostat <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> which detects abnormal heat generation to interrupt the power to be supplied to each coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Additionally, when alternately energizing the respective coils, it is beneficial to employ a method which gradually lowers the frequency without suddenly raising to a predetermined output with a variable frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The above-described method which does not suddenly apply a maximum value of the power which can be inputted to the coils is known as the soft start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned soft start is preferably managed within 0.5 second as already described. Thereafter, the frequency is determined based on the conditions of the immediately preceding or previous energization. The output is detected and corrected with a predetermined timing. It is to be noted that the coil output, i.e., the power consumed by the coil is detected by detecting the inputted voltage and current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Since the time of energization to each coil can be constantly switched when the power is alternately supplied to each coil since the consumption status of the thermal energy and the temperature are detected by the above-described temperature detecting means, i.e., thermistors in this manner. Incidentally, as already described, any pattern may be selected based on the operation status of the copying machine main body (for example, in the warming-up, in the copying, in the copying of the small-size paper, and in the ready mode or the like) and a temperature detected by the temperature detecting means. </paragraph>

It is to be noted that reference numerals with &ldquo;140&rdquo; added thereto denote structures equal or similar to those in the induction coils described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, thereby omitting the detail explanation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference> illustrate modifications of the electromagnetic induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>.

It is to be noted that reference numerals with &ldquo;170&rdquo; added thereto denote structures equal or similar to those in the induction coils described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, thereby omitting the detailed explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16, 17A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> illustrate examples in which the induction coil having a double structure consisting of an outer coil from which the main maximum performance must be essentially brought out and which corresponds to a maximum length of the paper to be heated and an inner coil which is arranged on the inner side of the outer coil and corresponds to the small-size paper, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The induction coil shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> has an inner coil <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which is a solenoidal coil wound along the rotational axis of the heat roller and an outer coil <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> which is wound along the axial direction (planar type) in order to reduce the loss caused by the respective coils, and magnetic field generation directions forms a right angle. A magnetic substance core <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is arranged inside the core material of this induction coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In the induction coils shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, both the outer coil <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>) and the inner coil <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>) are wound along the axial direction. Incidentally, as apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, when seeing the cross section of the central part of the induction coil, the arrangement of the wire material is well designed so as not to overlap the outer coil <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and the inner coil <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as to the outer coil of the induction coil in particular, heat generation at the both end portions of the coil must be reinforced as compared with the central part because of a problem of heat radiation to the both end portions from the open part of the heat roller and heat taken by the bearing or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the both end portions of the coil are hollow, reducing the offset of the magnetic flux by increasing a distance between electric wires at each end portion of the coil <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> can suffice (for example, the minimum portion is increased from 10 mm to 15 mm), or an interval between the electric wire and the heat roller at each end portion may be narrowed (from 2 mm to 3 mm), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the both end portions of the coil have the core, the width of the core may be widened at each end portion (from 5 mm to 8 mm), or the distance between the end portion of the core and the heat roller may be reduced (from 8 mm to 4 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, by reducing the distance between the core and the heat roller, a drop in temperature immediately after the warming-up time can be uniformly suppressed (within 10&deg; C.) in the rotational axis direction of the heat roller. In addition, as to drive of the coil, the outer first coil is energized at the time of warming-up or regular copying, but only the inner coil is driven when the small-size paper is printed or the both end portions generate heat to a set value or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> At that moment, since the range of a frequency which can be oscillated is restricted in induction heating, it is necessary to design in such a manner that the respective coils can obtain the same output at the same frequency in order extensively use the output range by a plurality of the coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as already described above, the above-described fixing mechanism is set so as to obtain an output of 700 W to 1400 W at a frequency of 20 kHz to 40 kHz when the power supply voltage is 100 V. Additionally, the upper limits of the outputs are substantially the same and become a maximum value which is allowed to the fixing mechanism. In order to realize this, a plurality of the coils must be substantially the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In this case, in order to alternately drive the outer coil and the inner coil, they must not be simultaneously energized. Incidentally, if a difference in output from these coils is large, the voltage of the same power supply line may be lowered when alternately driving the coils, and hence an output difference is suppressed to 200 W or lower at the time of alternate energization. Further, although already described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, the timing for switching the coil as an energization target is an interval not more than 20 msec from zero cross. </paragraph>
