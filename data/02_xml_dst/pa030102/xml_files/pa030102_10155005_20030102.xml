<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to imaging devices and more particular to devices suitable for identification of an individual from an examination of their fingerprint characteristics and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fingerprint analysis is amongst the most widely used and studied biometric techniques. During the last two decades, many new and exciting developments have taken place in the field of fingerprint science, summarized for example in the monograph <highlight><italic>Advances in Fingerprint Technology, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ed., edited by H. C. Lee and R. E. Gaensslen (CRC Press, 2001). Fingerprint identification not only plays a major role in forensic or police science, but also in controlling the building-access or information-access of individuals to buildings, rooms, and devices such as computer terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically in electronic fingerprint matching, a live fingerprint is scanned and electronically digitized. The digitized data generally contains information pertaining to characteristic features of the fingerprint, such as ridge endings, points of ridge bifurcation, and the core of a whorl, i.e. fingerprint minutiae. The digitized data is then compared with stored data relating to fingerprints that have been obtained previously from corresponding authorized persons, i.e. fingerprint templates. When a match is detected, within a predetermined level of security in the form of a predetermined false acceptance rate, the individual is identified and a corresponding action is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, there are two types of errors associated with fingerprint identification. The first is false reject or Type I error, and the second is false accept or Type II error. A Type II error occurs when there are enough similarities between fingerprints of two individuals, that one is mistaken for the other. A Type I error occurs for a variety of reasons, and refers to when an individual is not identified even though the individual is an authorized user registered with the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has been suggested that the underlying cause of errors in fingerprint analysis is that the amount of data from a fingerprint is too limited for it to be used in a biometric identification system involving a large number of users. Typically, there are only 30 to 40 minutia points available in a fingerprint. Alternatively, poor performance of fingerprint verification systems is attributed to the fact that the final verification decisions are based upon comparisons of small isolated regions of the fingerprint, when in fact a small sampling of the ridges does not provide enough detail to accurately verify or identify an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One way to increase the accuracy of fingerprint identification is to include the analysis of pores within the ridges of the fingers, such as sweat pores. Pores are naturally occurring physical characteristics of the skin, which have conventionally been ignored in biometric identification. However, a typical finger contains about 50 to 300 pores, each of which varies in size and shape, and that is used in combination with other pores and pore locations for uniquely identifying an individual. Furthermore, the analysis of pore prints generally obviates the fraudulent problems encountered with fingerprint identification, since latent fingerprints do not generally contain a lot of detail about pore size, shape and/or distribution. Consequently, the use of latent fingerprints, which often fools most fingerprint identification systems, does not deceive pore print identification systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a paper entitled Automated <highlight><italic>System for Fingerprint Authentication </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Proc. SPIE </italic></highlight>1994, 2277, 210-223), Stosz et al. describe a novel technique for automated fingerprint authentication, which utilizes pore information extracted from live scanned images. The position of the pores on the fingerprint ridges is known to provide information that is unique to an individual and is sufficient for use in identification. By combining the use of ridge and pore features, a unique multilevel verification/identification technique has been developed that possesses advantages over systems employing ridge information only. An optical/electronic sensor capable of providing a high resolution fingerprint image is required for extraction of pertinent pore information, which makes it unlikely that electronically scanned inked fingerprints would contain adequate pore data that is sufficient, or consistent enough, for use in authentication. The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated by a working system that was designed to provide secure access to a computer. Low Type I error rates, and no Type II errors have been observed based on initial testing of the prototype verification system. It has been suggested by Stosz et al. that a high-resolution scanner of at least 800 DPI or greater is required to accurately resolve pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,982,914 to Lee et al. issued Nov. 9, 1999, discloses a method of identifying an individual using an analysis of both pore locations and minutia data. The method comprises obtaining from an individual during a registration process, a fingerprint image having at least one registration pore and at least one registration macrofeature, that is a ridge or minutia. In a bid step, a fingerprint image having at least one bid pore and at least one bid macrofeature is obtained. Bid associated data is compared to the registration associated data to produce a correlation score, wherein a successful or failed identification is obtained based on comparison of the correlation score to a predetermined threshold value. In the teachings of Lee et al. the analyses were accomplished using a commercially available 500 DPI resolution scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although the prior art clearly benefits from pore print technology, it does not truly exploit the advantages of pore print identification. Specifically, in the system disclosed by Lee et al. the commercially available 500 DPI resolution scanner is not able to extract pore detail relating to the size and shape of the pores. In fact, the teachings ignore the detailed pore morphology and concentrate on pore distribution with respect to fingerprint minutiae. As a result, this system incurs many of the same limitations as conventional fingerprint identification systems. Specifically, the individual must have an undamaged fingerprint, the imaging device must be able to acquire a full fingerprint image (i.e., a surface area of approximately 3&times;2 cm size), and the individual must precisely align the predetermined finger or thumb in a manner that allows a proper matching. In the system disclosed by Stosz et al. the high-resolution scanner, which is large, bulky, expensive, and difficult to manufacture, is the greatest disadvantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that it is only necessary to scan a small sampling area of a live pore print for comparison to a portion of the stored pore print template, since pores, unlike fingerprint minutiae, are distinguishable from much smaller cross-sections. For example, if there are typically only 30 to 40 minutia points available from a fingerprint covering an area of approximately 2&times;1 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, then an imaging device with a scanning area one quarter of that size statistically captures a quarter of the minutia points. Clearly, it would be highly inaccurate to base a biometric identification system on such a small amount of information. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that the characteristic minutiae, for example the core of the whirl, would be captured with a small sensor due to inconsistent sampling methods. In pore print analysis, the size, shape and location of the pores all contribute detailed information, thus increasing the accuracy of the biometric identification system and allowing a smaller scanning area to be used. In addition, the large number of pores typically available in a small cross-section of skin further contributes to the accuracy when sampling a smaller cross section. The difficulties in fingerprint analysis associated with inconsistent sampling methods are not a problem in pore print analysis, since any portion of the pore print is used to characterize the individual i.e., there is no need to capture localized minutiae as required in fingerprint analysis. Often, pore print registration provides a suitable cross-section of pores for characterization on a first attempt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, when only small regions of a fingerprint are sensed, difficulties of a different nature arise. Although the partial pore print provides sufficient information for identifying an individual by establishing that the scanned fingerprint is identical to one of the template fingerprints, this identification process is costly in processing time and processing resources, due to the high number of permutations needed when comparing the sensed profile with partial master profiles. The high number of permutations also adds a degree of uncertainty to the identification process. As a consequence, the type II error rate increases, requiring a less stringent predetermined false acceptance rate. It would be advantageous to have supporting information available, assisting in the step of selecting partial pore print patterns from the template database, which are likely candidates to provide a positive match with the scanned pore print profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, when scanning a series of partial areas of the fingerprint, a method that is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,989 to Borza issued Dec. 25, 2001, it is important that the finger moves in a defined motion across a sensing pad. When the sensing pad is constructed such that it requires a fingertip to move in one particular direction, deviations from the optimal scan direction reduce the amount of information gathered during the scanning process, and complicate the identification process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It would be advantageous to have a device at one&apos;s disposal, which, although utilizing the technique of partial area scanning, does not posses an inherent directional dependence on the direction of movement of the fingerprint to be imaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It would be of further advantage when the partial images recorded during a fingerprint scan cover the area of a fingerprint as complete as possible, so as to provide a maximum of information, as to establish the use of low false acceptance rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It would also be advantageous to provide a device that is small, robust, and cost efficient, and at the same time allowing to record high resolution images. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An exemplary capacitive contact imager driver circuit is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,089 to Borza issued Jul. 7, 1998 and incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary swipe fingerprint scanner is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/984,354, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the prior art, a contact imager comprises a group of sensor elements comprising r rows (1 to r) with c sensing elements or columns (1 to c) in each row. Optionally, the sensing elements are individually spaced. In practice there are about 300 rows and 200 columns of regularly spaced elements occupying an area of approximately 2&times;3 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. This area is for accepting a fingertip for scanning. The sense elements comprise a charge sensing electrode and an amplifier circuit wherein the amplifier circuit amplifies voltage induced in the sensing electrode by a biological source, for example a fingertip. Unfortunately, larger sensing areas for contact imagers have many drawbacks. They are more fragile and therefore more subject to failure; they are more costly; and they require more space and more energy to operate effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Turning to problems of pore print analysis, different limitations are associated with systems that are intended for performing such an analysis. Of course, high-resolution images are essential for comparison in order to perform a pore print analysis successfully. A user provides a predetermined biological surface, for example a right thumb, to a high-resolution scanner in order to record a high-resolution reference pore print or template. The high-resolution scanner that is used to obtain the reference pore print must be large enough to capture an image of the entire biological surface. Unfortunately, large high-resolution scanners are very expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another form of contact imager is a swipe imager. In the swipe imager, a biometric information source is passed over an imager and data is recorded during the motion of passing over. Such an imager requires a far smaller array of imaging elements. As an example, a swipe imager comprises 30 rows by 200 columns resulting in a contact imager of approximately {fraction (1/10)}<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>of the area of the prior art device. Problematically, swipe fingerprint imagers are subject to reproducibility difficulties and are more prone to errors due to dryness or wetness of, for example, fingertips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the sense elements are arranged as to form individual linear capacitive sensing arrays within a same sensing pad. Within each linear capacitive sensing array the rows are equally spaced by a given row spacing, and the columns are equally spaced by a given column spacing. Each linear sensing array has a capacitive detective area and a resolution, depending on an area and a number of rows and columns forming the linear capacitive sensing array. In practice there are about 10 rows and 200 columns of regularly spaced elements, occupying an area of approximately 0.1&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, in a representative linear capacitive sensing array. The sensing element density of the linear capacitive sensing array, which is inversely proportional to the row spacing and the column spacing of the linear capacitive sensing array, determines the resolution of the linear capacitive sensing array. Sensing elements are sized and disposed in such a fashion that they are capable of distinguishing the smallest desired feature of a fingerprint. The placement and spacing of the sensor elements allow an image of a fingerprint, once scanned, to contain sufficient features for analysis. Preferably, in order to generate an image for analysis, a sensing element is smaller than half the smallest feature size to be sensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As a biological surface such as a fingertip is passed across the individual linear capacitive sensing arrays, successive rows across the fingertip are imaged. A processor is used to correlate data received from different linear capacitive sensing arrays, with each other and with previously stored sample data. The charge induced in the charge sensing electrodes roughly depends on the separation of the biological surface from the charge sensing electrodes, and is therefore different for ridges and troughs of a fingerprint structure, as well as for fingerprint pores. Thus, the scanning techniques as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,089 to Borza, issued Jul. 7, 1998, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,056 to Tsikos, issued Oct. 5, 1982, not only allow for sensing of the fingerprint minutiae, but also, when individual sensing element size is appropriate, allow for sensing of the pore profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an exemplary imaging device according to prior art is shown. A sensing pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The sensing pad has an area of approximately 3&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for accepting a fingertip drawn across the sensing pad. In this example, the linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises 10 rows and 300 columns. The linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected through an analog switch matrix to facilitate reading of the image of a biological surface. Timing and sequencing logic selects each element in the array, in turn, to produce a complete image of a fingerprint presented to the device. The output signal is directly sent as an analog signal or, alternatively, is converted to a digital signal prior to output from the device. A processor, which receives the data from the linear capacitive sensing device, constructs a series of partial snapshots of the fingerprint. The individual images have a sensing time difference &tgr;, which is determined by the timing and sequencing logic. A reconstruction of an image representative of the biological surface scanned is based on finding overlapping areas between captured images; the reconstruction is achieved for example in a puzzle-like fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The resolution of the imaging device is determined by the sensing element density. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, by modifying the space between consecutive rows, the resolution of the imaging device is inversely modified. Therefore, the resolution is doubled, when the row spacing is reduced to half of its original value. With this small size, it is possible that a fast moving fingertip will provide image data for non-overlapping portions thereof, which is generally considered undesirable. Alternatively, the imager is provided with a very high bandwidth to support rapid image sensing, thereby increasing its cost, signal to noise and/or power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises two linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Both arrays comprise the same number of sensing elements, arranged in the same number of rows and the same number of columns. As an example, both linear capacitive sensing arrays comprise 10 rows and 200 columns. The row spacing of the first linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is given as &dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The second linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is spaced away from the first array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a spacing of (N&plus;1/2)&middot;&dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, N being an integer. Both linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> By providing a space other than an integral multiple of the row spacing &dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the regular pattern of sensing a biological surface is also modified such that in image reconstruction accurate alignment is now possible on the row and on the half row. Thus, an image of the biological surface is capable of being reconstructed with twice the resolution: one times the resolution on the row boundary and one times the resolution on the half row boundary when interleaved provides twice the resolution. However, the disadvantages described above relating to a decrease in surface area are obviated when the two linear capacitive sensing arrays are irregularly spaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according to a second embodiment of the present invention is shown. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises two linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which now have a different number of sensing elements. In this example, the linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises 10 rows and 200 columns, whereas the linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises 20 rows and 20 columns. Preferably, the linear sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first resolution, and the linear sensing array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a same resolution. Alternatively, the linear sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first resolution, and the linear sensing array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a second, other resolution. The same interleaving functionality as described for the imaging device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is also performed by the device described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Here the larger images are interleaved with the help of the small images offset therefrom by other than an integer multiple of a line spacing, which allows for more accurate alignment of images. Therefore, increasing the number of sensing elements by 20% increases the resolution of the imaging device by 100%. The small images then serve as guide images in interleaving the large images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according to a third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and three small capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this example, the linear capacitive sensing array comprises 10 rows and 200 columns, whereas each of the small linear capacitive sensing arrays comprises 20 rows and 20 columns. The first small linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the linear capacitive sensing array by a distance &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;(N&plus;1/2)&middot;&dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Again, &dgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>stands for the row spacing of the linear capacitive sensing device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and N is an integer. The second small linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is spaced apart form the capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a distance &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;(N&plus;1/4)&middot;&dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, whereas the third small linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is spaced apart by a distance &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;(N&plus;3/4)&middot;&dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. This way, through interleaving of the series of partial images retrieved by the imaging device, a four-fold increase in resolution is obtained, whereas the number of sensing elements is approximately doubled. Optionally, other arrangements of the sensing array and two or more small sensing arrays are envisaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a lower-resolution linear capacitive array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a higher-resolution linear capacitive array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Here, the lower-resolution linear capacitive array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises 10 rows and 200 columns of capacitive sensing elements, whereas the higher-resolution linear capacitive array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises 40 rows and 40 columns of capacitive sensing elements. Additionally, each of the linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is in communication with the processor for processing the image data provided from each of the linear capacitive arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The size of the lower-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.1&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, whereas the size of the higher-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.2&times;0.2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a resolution of 10,000 S.E./cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, whereas array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a resolution of 40,000 S.E/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. (S.E.&equals;sensing elements). The fact that the higher-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a resolution four times as high as the lower-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enables one not only to perform interleaving of different images as described above, but also enables one to perform additional functionalities, which rely on high-resolution images. For example, pore print identification requires a resolution approximately four times as high as that used for conventional fingerprint analysis. Therefore, the device described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is suitable for pore print analysis as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In use, an individual wishing to be authenticated swipes a predetermined biological surface, for instance a right thumb, over the sensing pad <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a direction normal to the linear capacitive arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This direction is referred to as longitudinal swipe direction. Typically, the longitudinal swipe direction is approximately equal to a longitudinal dimension of a digit to be scanned. The lower-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> captures a plurality of images across the fingertip. Approximately simultaneously the higher-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> captures a plurality of images across the fingertip. The processor merges each plurality of images to reconstruct a high-resolution image. Advantageously, the spatial relationship between a high-resolution image and a low-resolution image is known, since the placement of sensing elements in each array is precisely known. Optionally, the spacing &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>between the arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a non-integer multiple of the row spacing &dgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the first, lower-resolution array, &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&equals;(N&plus;1/n)&middot;&dgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, where N and n are integers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, optionally the lower-resolution array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used to capture a first image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>*, for example the ridge-trough pattern of the fingertip, and the high-resolution array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used to capture a second image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>*, for example pore print data. Advantageously, the spatial relationship between the high-resolution image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>* and the low-resolution image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>* is known. Thus, the lower-resolution image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>* can be used to simplify the comparison of the higher-resolution image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>* and a high-resolution template image by establishing the approximate location of the high-resolution image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>* across the fingertip and therefore within the template. Of course, the amount of processing required for matching the high-resolution image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>* with the higher-resolution template is greatly reduced. Optionally, the higher-resolution image <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>* is compared to the high-resolution template image first, and the lower-resolution image <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>* is used subsequently to verify correct user authentication. Further optionally, the lower resolution image is used to identify the user and a comparison of the higher resolution image with a template associated with the identified user is then used to substantiate the identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrates a simplified block diagram of an imaging device, according to a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention. A sensing pad <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a higher-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an intermediate-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a lower-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has an area of approximately 3&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for accepting a fingertip drawn across the sensing elements. For instance, the lower-resolution linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises 5-10 rows and 200 columns of capacitive sensing elements, and the high-resolution sensing pad <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises 20-40 rows and 50 columns of capacitive sensing elements. The intermediate-resolution sensing pad <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises preferably 10-20 rows and 100 columns of capacitive sensing elements. The areas covered by the three linear capacitive sensing arrays are approximately 0.1&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 0.1&times;0.5 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 0.1&times;1 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively, which results in maximum resolutions of 10,000 S.E./cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, 40,000 S.E./cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and 20,000 S.E./cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively. Additionally, each linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in communication with the processor for processing the image data provided thereto from the arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The imaging device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is well suited for capturing a complete image, corresponding to fingertips of arbitrary size. For example, if the user swipes a right thumb across the linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the system selects the image produced by the widest array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, because array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is capable of imaging the entire biological surface with a single swipe, albeit at a lower resolution. Alternatively, if the user swipes a right little finger, the system may select the image captured by the narrowest array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, because array <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is capable of imaging the entire biological surface with a single swipe and advantageously provides a higher-resolution image than either of the arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the imaging device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>overcomes the problem of different fingers being of different size. As such, it is other than necessary to clip and scale the images prior to using a comparison algorithm. Further advantageously, the imaging device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is well suited for imaging biological surfaces provided by adult users, adolescent users and even child users, the latter group of users typically excluded from identification with present day biometric identification systems due to their very small biological surfaces requiring high-resolution devices to image satisfactorily. Still further advantageously, if a finger is swiped off center of the sensing pad <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, typically a full image of the biological surface is capturable with the lower-resolution using array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and at least a partial image of the biological surface is captured approximately simultaneously with a higher resolution using one of the arrays <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Of course, the spatial relationship across the finger between the lower-resolution image and the higher-resolution image is precisely known, allowing pore print analysis to be performed in addition to fingerprint analysis. This improves reliability when, for example, a core of the fingerprint fails to pass over the high resolution imager or where only a small part of a fingertip is accurately imaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The concepts developed in the previous paragraphs are illustrated for arrays, which are spaced apart by a non-integer multiple of the row spacing. Alternatively, the same concepts are applied to the column spacing, thus arranging different arrays with an offset of a non-integer multiple of the column spacing. This way, an increase in resolution not only in a direction essential parallel to a swipe direction of the biological surface, but also in a direction essential orthogonal to a swipe direction of the biological surface, is obtainable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The swipe imagers described above require a finger to be moved in a known direction along the sensing pad. Unfortunately, it is not always convenient to do so. For example, when carrying a briefcase or speaking on the phone, it may be easier to move the finger one way, rather than another. Thus, a fingerprint imager that accepts fingerprints swiped in any direction is highly advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according to a sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown, in which a sensing pad <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises two linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The first linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises 10 rows and 200 columns, and forms a latitudinal linear capacitive sensing array. The second linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises 200 rows and 10 columns, and forms a longitudinal linear capacitive sensing array. The array <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is arranged in a way that its rows are parallel to the rows of array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the array <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is centered with respect to the array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the arrays <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are arranged in a T-shape. The first longitudinal linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> images a fingertip moving back and forth in a longitudinal direction, while a fingertip moving side to side in a latitudinal direction is imaged by the second latitudinal linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Of course, a fingertip moving in other directions is imaged by both the first and the second linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this way, the imaging device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not depend on a specific swiping direction of the biological surface to be scanned, in order to capture a sufficient amount of data for image reconstruction. This imaging device is therefore referred to as multi-directional sensing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a simplified block-diagram of a seventh preferred embodiment of the present invention illustrated. In the example as shown, the multidirectional sensing device is cross-shaped. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises a longitudinal linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which comprises 200 rows and 10 columns of sensing elements. Adding two latitudinal linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>compensates the difference in resolution between a longitudinal and a latitudinal sweep across the linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, such an assembly of arrays allows scanning a biological surface with a high resolution regardless of the direction the biological surface is swiped. Preferably, the arrays have similar resolution in each of the two orthogonal directions&mdash;longitudinal and latitudinal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Another possibility to construct a multi-directional sensing device is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which shows a simplified block diagram of an imaging device according to an eighth preferred embodiment of the present invention. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises four linear capacitive sensing arrays. Two longitudinal arrays <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are aligned along a common latitudinal direction, and two latitudinal sensing pads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are aligned along a common longitudinal direction. The four sensing pads have one straight end, and the other opposing end is arrow-shaped. All four arrow-shaped ends are adjacent. In the seventh embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the resolution in the area of the sensing pad where the sensing arrays meet, is typically different for a latitudinal and for a longitudinal sweep. In the eighth embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the arrow-shaped ends of the sensing arrays ensure an equal contribution of longitudinally as well as latitudinally oriented sensing arrays in the crossing area. Further, it allows for use of four identical imaging devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in a ninth preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the four linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>have two straight ends, and a fifth linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed in the area enclosed by the four linear capacitive sensing arrays <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Preferably, the fifth linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides a higher resolution area of the sensing device thereby supporting all of the advantages of the invention including interleaving, pore print imaging, multi-directional swipe imaging, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Further alternatively, three or more than four linear capacitive sensing arrays are disposed in different directions to provide the advantages of the present invention. For example, the arrays could be arranged in the shape of a z,<highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> , or in the shape of three angularly displaced sensors (not shown). In this latter case it is possible to provide each linear capacitive sensing array with a pointed end for interfacing with the other sensors or to provide a fourth different shaped linear capacitive sensing array disposed at the meeting point of the other three arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Of course, the many individual linear capacitive sensing arrays not only allow for multi-directional sensing of a biological surface, but they optionally have individual resolutions, such as higher-resolution, intermediate-resolution, and lower-resolution. The different linear capacitive sensing arrays of different resolutions are then used for sensing different characteristics of the biological surface, as for example pore prints and fingerprint minutiae, which is done not in a one-directional, but in a multidirectional scan mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiments of the present invention make use of linear capacitive sensing arrays possibly insufficient in breadth to span a surface to be imaged and insufficient along an orthogonal dimension to image the entire surface for capturing an image of a fingerprint. This requires that the sensing pad sense and provide data at a rate to ensure that the data is correctly captured. It is often preferable to install a sensor that provides a separate data stream that informs the system of the relative motion of the fingertip along each axis of the linear capacitive sensing arrays. It is preferable to employ image analysis in conjunction with the motion sensor data to construct a composite image of the fingerprint as this allows for compensation for slip in the motion sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A tenth embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The sensing pad <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> comprises a first longitudinal linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having 10 rows and 200 columns, and a second latitudinal linear capacitive sensing array <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> comprises 200 rows and 10 columns. The array <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is arranged in a way that its rows are parallel to the rows of array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the array <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is aligned at one of the edges of the array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, the two sensing arrays are arranged to substantially form a right angle. In this modification, a motion sensor in form of a track ball <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is added to the overall system. The trackball <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to a processor for processing the motion data provided from the motion sensor. The motion sensor reduces an amount of redundant information that the sensing pad <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> captures, provides additional information for image construction, and allows for sensing of a moving surface regardless of direction or type of motion. Thus, for example, the linear capacitive sensing arrays do not begin capturing data until the motion sensor registers the motion of the fingertip. Once the finger motion is acknowledged, additional information from the motion sensor allows for determination of the speed at which the finger is moving across the imaging array and adjusting the imaging array data capture frequency accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The use of a motion sensor is not limited to the tenth embodiment of the present invention as described above, but is applicable to all of the previously described embodiments. In cases where two linear capacitive sensing arrays form an angle, the motion sensor in form of the trackball is preferably positioned close to where the two linear capacitive sensing arrays meet to form the angle. This way, movement of a biological surface to be scanned across any of the linear capacitive sensing arrays is monitored by the trackball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a plurality of trackballs is used for monitoring the motion of a biological surface moving across the sensing pad. Advantageously, when the sensing pad comprises more than one linear capacitive sensing array, the linear capacitive sensing arrays forming at least one substantially right angle, the trackballs are positioned in close vicinity to the at least one substantially right angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> schematic drawing of a biometric sensing device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. The biometric sensing device comprises a sensing pad <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in contact with the sensing pad <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>.
