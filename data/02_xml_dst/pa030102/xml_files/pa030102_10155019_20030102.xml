<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based on and incorporates herein by reference Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-199999 filed on Jun. 29, 2001. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a dynamo-electric machine, such as a blower motor of a vehicle air conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A motor, such as a blower motor of a vehicle air conditioning system, includes a yoke. A pair of curved magnets, which are curved to conform with an inner circumferential surface of the yoke, are secured to the inner circumferential surface of the yoke in diametrically opposed relationship to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A rotor is rotatably received within the yoke. A drive shaft extends along a rotational axis of the rotor and is secured to the rotor to rotate integrally with the rotor. A predetermined number of cores are circumferentially arranged in the rotor at equal angular intervals. Each core has a rectangular plate tooth, which radially outwardly protrudes toward the yoke. A winding is wound around each tooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The blower motor of the vehicle air conditioning system is normally placed in a passenger cabin of a vehicle, so that the blower motor is required to achieve a relatively high degree of silence during rotation of the blower motor. Thus, rather than using ball bearings, which can relatively easily transmit vibrations from the rotor (armature), slide bearings made of a sintered metal material, which does not easily transmit vibrations from the rotor (armature), are commonly used to rotatably support the drive shaft of the blower motor of the vehicle air-conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the slide bearing requires oil in a contacting portion, which makes sliding contact with the drive shaft of the motor. Thus, maintenance of the oil is required, and spill of the oil from the slide bearing could occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the slide bearing, a washer or the like is required, causing an increase in the number of the components. This results in an increased complexity of the bearing structure of the motor and an increased complexity of the manufacturing steps of the bearing structure of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, unlike the slide bearing, if the ball bearing is used in the bearing structure of the motor, the oil in the contacting portion, which makes sliding contact with the drive shaft of the motor, is not required. Thus, with use of the ball bearing, the disadvantages, which result from the maintenance of the oil or the spill of the oil, can be avoided, and the washers or the like are not required. This substantially simplifies the bearing structure of the motor and the manufacturing steps of the bearing structure of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The ball bearing can relatively easily transmit vibrations induced, particularly, by cogging torque of the rotor (i.e., torque generated in the rotor due to changes in attractive force and repulsive force between the magnets and the rotor). Thus, it is effective to reduce the cogging torque to reduce the vibrations of the rotor and to achieve a higher degree of silence during the rotation of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One way of reducing the cogging torque is to gradually reduce a wall thickness (radial dimension) of each magnet toward its circumferential ends. However, this measurement alone cannot reduce the cogging torque to an acceptable level, which allows use of the ball bearing in the blower motor of the vehicle air conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another way of reducing the cogging torque is to use a rotor having skewed cores. Although this measurement can reduce the cogging torque, it generally results in some disadvantages, such as a reduction in a winding surface area of each core, around which the winding is wound. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the above disadvantages. Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a dynamo-electric machine, which effectively reduces cogging torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To achieve the objective of the present invention, there is provided a dynamo-electric machine, which includes a yoke, a rotor and a plurality of curved magnets. The rotor is rotatably received in the yoke and includes a predetermined number of cores circumferentially arranged at substantially equal angular intervals, and each core includes a tooth, which radially outwardly extends toward the yoke. The magnets are secured to an inner circumferential surface of the yoke. Each magnet has first and second tapered portions, which are tapered in opposite circumferential directions. Each of the first and second tapered portions has axially opposed first and second tapered surfaces. An axial distance between the first tapered surface and the second tapered surface of each of the first and second tapered portions decreases toward an outer circumferential end of each of the first and second tapered portions. The first tapered surface of each of the first and second tapered portions has a first opposing point, which is radially opposed to a first imaginary end circle defined by outer peripheral surfaces of the cores at one axial ends of the cores. The second tapered surface of each of the first and second tapered portions has a second opposing point, which is radially opposed to a second imaginary end circle defined by the outer peripheral surfaces of the cores at the other axial ends of the cores. The rotor and each magnet are configured to satisfy one of the following conditions: (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T, wherein Z is a number of the cores of the rotor, D is an outer diameter of the rotor, T is a circumferential dimension of each tooth, X is a circumferential dimension between a circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the first tapered portion and a circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the second tapered portion when each magnet is viewed from a radial direction, and n is the number of the teeth that are entirely placed within a range defined by X when a circumferential center of one of the teeth is radially opposed to a circumferential center of the range defined by X.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A motor (acting as a dynamo-electric machine) according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment is constructed as a blower motor of a vehicle air-conditioning system and has a cylindrical yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported by a motor holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is secured to the motor holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A pair of curved magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are curved to conform with an inner circumferential surface of the yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are secured to the inner circumferential surface of the yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are diametrically opposed to each other and have substantially the same shape. A wall thickness (radial dimension) of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is gradually reduced toward circumferential ends of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has first and second tapered portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which are tapered in opposite circumferential directions. The first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has axially opposed first and second tapered planar surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Similarly, the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has axially opposed first and second tapered planar surfaces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In each of the first and second tapered portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, an axial distance between the first tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>gradually decreases toward an outer circumferential end of the tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed to be symmetrical with respect to a circumferential center line and also with respect to a vertical center line of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotatably received in the yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends along a rotational axis of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is secured to the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to rotate integrally with the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by ball bearings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. A fan <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is secured to a distal end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create air flow when electric current is supplied from an external power source, such as a vehicle battery, to the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through brushes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a commutator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to rotate the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A predetermined number of cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are arranged in the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at equal angular intervals in a circumferential direction of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> vertical length (axial dimension) of each core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is greater than a vertical length (axial dimension) of each circumferential end surface of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a vertical center (axial center) of each core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is at the same height (the same axial position) as a vertical center of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Each core <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a rectangular plate tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which radially protrudes toward the yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A winding <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is wound around each tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the windings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are eliminated in the drawings except <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for the sake of clarity. Furthermore, an extended portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed in a distal end of each tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each extended portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends in the circumferential direction on both circumferential sides of the tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to prevent detachment of the winding from the tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the number of cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (the number of slots) of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is represented by Z (in this embodiment, Z is twelve). Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an outer diameter of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is represented by D (in this embodiment, D is 44.7 mm), and a width (circumferential dimension) of each tooth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the circumferential direction is represented by T (in this embodiment, T is 2.4 mm). With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a first opposing point, which is radially opposed to a first imaginary end circle defined by outer peripheral surfaces of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at one axial ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first imaginary end circle is defined to extend along the upper ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a second opposing point, which is radially opposed to a second imaginary end circle defined by the outer peripheral surfaces of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the other axial ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the second imaginary end circle is defined to extend along the lower ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the first tapered surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a first opposing point, which is radially opposed to the first imaginary end circle defined by the outer peripheral surfaces of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the one axial ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second tapered surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a second opposing point, which is radially opposed to the second imaginary end circle defined by the outer peripheral surfaces of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the other axial ends of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is viewed from a radial direction, a circumferential dimension between a circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is represented by X. The circumferential dimension X can be measured along an inner peripheral surface of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the circumferential dimension X can be measured along the outer peripheral surfaces of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a circumferential dimension between one point, which radially opposes the circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and another point, which radially opposes the circumferentially innermost one of the first and second opposing points of the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The number of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are entirely placed within a range defined by X when a circumferential center of one of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is radially opposed to a circumferential center of the range defined by X, is represented by n (n is an integer, which is equal to or greater than 1 but is equal to or less than Z, and n in this embodiment is three). The rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are configured to satisfy one of the following conditions: (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Operation of the present embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In each of the first and second tapered portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the axial distance between the first tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>gradually decreases toward the outer circumferential end of the tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Thus, magnetic attractive force or repulsive force between the magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> does not abruptly change during the rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and thus the cogging torque generated in the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is advantageously reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment, the magnetic flux generated from the magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forms a magnetic circuit Y, which flows in the yoke <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are symmetrically arranged with respect to the center of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cores <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the magnetic flux, which flows in the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that face the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is stabilized. Furthermore, when the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated from this stable state of the magnetic flux where the magnetic flux is stabilized, the magnetic flux changes (i.e., decreases and increases) until the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to the next stable state, causing generation of the cogging torque due to the variation of the magnetic flux. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The stable state of the magnetic flux normally occurs once per 2&pgr;/Z (i.e., one slot) rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the magnetic flux varies or changes during an interval between the two successive stable states to cause generation of the cogging torque (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the stable state of the magnetic flux occurs twice per 2&pgr;/Z (i.e., one slot) rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the variation of the magnetic flux between the two successive stable states is divided and is thus advantageously reduced to further reduce the cogging torque (in this case, the cogging torque is reduced to one half of the cogging torque generated in the above case where the stable state of the magnetic flux occurs once per 2&pgr;/Z rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, when one of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is centered on the circumferential center of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the number of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are entirely placed within the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is n, and none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by satisfying the following condition (condition for stabilizing the magnetic flux) of equation 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;(<highlight><italic>n&minus;</italic></highlight>1)&plus;<highlight><italic>T&lt;X&lt;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;(<highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>1)&minus;<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;equation (1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Then, in the one case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to make &pgr;/Z (i.e., one half slot) rotation from the above state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> where the one of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is centered on the circumferential center of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the number of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are entirely placed within the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is n&plus;1, and none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by satisfying the following condition (condition for stabilizing the magnetic flux) of equation 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;<highlight><italic>n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;(<highlight><italic>n&plus;</italic></highlight>2)&minus;<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;equation (2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in the other case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to make &pgr;/Z (i.e., one half slot) rotation from the above state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> where the one of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is centered on the circumferential center of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the number of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are entirely placed in the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is n&minus;1, and none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by satisfying the following condition (condition for stabilizing the magnetic flux) of equation 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;(<highlight><italic>n&minus;</italic></highlight>2)&plus;<highlight><italic>T&lt;X&lt;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)<highlight><italic>&times;n&minus;T</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;equation (3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Thus, the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment should satisfy one of the two conditions, i.e., (<highlight><italic>D&pgr;/Z</italic></highlight>)&times;n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, which correspond to the equations 1 and 2, respectively, and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, which correspond to the equations 1 and 3, respectively. Here, (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T in the condition of (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T represents the largest lower limit of X selected from the equations 1 and 2 (i.e., selected from (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T). Furthermore, (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T in the same condition of (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T represents the smallest upper limit of X selected from the equations 1 and 2 (i.e., selected from (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;2)&minus;T). Also, (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T in the condition of (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T represents the largest lower limit of X selected from the equations 1 and 3 (i.e., selected from (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;2)&plus;T. Furthermore, (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T in the same condition of (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T represents the smallest upper limit of X selected from the equations 1 and 3 (i.e., selected from (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&plus;1)&minus;T and (D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T). With the above arrangements, the stable states of the magnetic flux can be achieved twice per 2&pgr;/z rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (i.e., per one slot). Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the cogging torque can be advantageously reduced without causing an undesirable result, such as a reduction in a winding area of the winding in each core, which occurs in the case where the skewed cores are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As a result, vibrations of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are advantageously reduced to achieve a relatively high degree of silence during the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the ball bearing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be used in each bearing structure of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> even in the environment where a relatively high degree of silence is required during the rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, unlike the case where the slide bearing is used in each baring structure of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the ball bearing is used in the bearing structure of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the oil is not required in the contacting portion of the bearing structure, which contacts the drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, disadvantages, which result from the maintenance of the oil and the spill of the oil, can be avoided. Furthermore, the washers or the like are not required. Thus, the bearing structure of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the manufacturing steps of the bearing structure of the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are substantially simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also, in the motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, the wall thickness of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is gradually reduced toward the circumferential ends of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the attractive force or the repulsive force between the magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> does not abruptly change, so that the cogging torque generated in the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is advantageously reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> achieves a high performance (i.e., generating relatively high magnetic force), and thus a size of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be reduced, it is advantageous to satisfies the condition of (D&pgr;/Z)&times;(n&minus;1)&plus;T&lt;X&lt;(D&pgr;/Z)&times;n&minus;T, as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> where the size of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is smaller than that of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the present embodiment, each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is symmetrical with respect to its circumferential center line and also with respect to its vertical center line. However, each magnet can be modified to a magnet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (dynamo-electric machine) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The magnet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is non-symmetrical with respect to its circumferential center line nor with respect to a vertical center line but is symmetrical with respect to its center point. Alternatively, each magnet can be modified to a magnet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of a motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (dynamo-electric machine) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The magnet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is non-symmetrical with respect to its circumferential center line. In the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, X</cross-reference> is the circumferential dimension between the first opposing point of the first tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first tapered portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second opposing point of the second tapered surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second tapered portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the pair of diametrically opposed magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided. The present invention is not limited to this arrangement, and the number of the magnets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be changed to any even number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Also, in the present embodiment, each tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is planar. However, each tapered surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be curved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the wall thickness (radial dimension) of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is gradually reduced toward the circumferential ends of the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the wall thickness of each magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be substantially uniform throughout the magnet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, the ball bearings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are used to rotatably support the drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, at least one of the ball bearings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can be replaced with a slide bearing(s) to rotatably support the drive shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Two comparative examples will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to illustrate the advantages of the above embodiment. In these comparative examples, components similar to those discussed in the above embodiment will be indicated with similar numerals and will not be discussed further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (dynamo-electric machine) of the first comparative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, when one of teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is centered on a circumferential center of a range X of a magnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, two teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> face circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively, resulting in an unstable state of magnetic flux (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). At this state, when the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to make &pgr;/Z (i.e., one half slot) rotation, none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, resulting in a stable state of the magnetic flux (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a motor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (dynamo-electric machine) of the second comparative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, when one of teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is centered on a circumferential center of a range X of a magnet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, none of the teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> faces the circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, resulting in a stable state of magnetic flux (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). At this state, when the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotated to make &pgr;/Z (i.e., one half slot) rotation, two teeth <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> face circumferential ends of the range X of the magnet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, resulting in an unstable state of magnetic flux (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, in these motors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the stable state of the magnetic flux occurs only once per 2&pgr;/z (i.e., one slot) rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, the magnetic flux largely changes between the two successive stable states of the magnetic flux, resulting in generation of a relatively large cogging torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The invention in its broader terms is therefore, not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus, and illustrative examples shown and described. </paragraph>
