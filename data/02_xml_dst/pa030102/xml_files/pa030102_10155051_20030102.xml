<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to curling irons and, in particular, to curling irons for placing helical curls in the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Conventional curling irons have a pair of heating elements arranged in a scissor-like manner whereby a portion of hair is secured between the elements. Typically, the heating element is smooth and cylindrical and the second element is arcuate in conformance with the first element. The second element is attached at one end to a handle by a spring mechanism for releasably gripping hair. To produce a curl, hair is wrapped around the heating element while held in place with the second element. The amount of curl is controlled in two-dimensions by sizing the circumference of the heating element. Conventional curling irons cannot control or consistently produce curls in a third dimension, such as helical curls. Accordingly, there exists a need for such a device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the foregoing, it is a primary object of the invention to provide a spiral curling iron that overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore known devices and methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the instant invention to provide a curling iron that consistently places a helical shaped curl in hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an additional object of the instant invention to provide a curling iron having grooves in the heating element for providing curls of various designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing objects and other objects the instant invention teaches a curling iron including an elongated heating element having a helical groove formed therein. The curling iron can also include a handle projecting from the heating element. An elongated clamp complements the heating element and the helical groove. A pliers-like handle connects to the clamp. A hinge pivotally connects the clamp to the heating element. The hinge is located between the handle and the clamp. A thermally-insulated tip can be connected to the heating element at the end opposing the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a spiral curling iron, various modifications and structural changes to the groove may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these and other objects, which will become apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> depict the preferred and alternative embodiments of the helical curling iron of the instant invention which is generally characterized as a curling iron and, or by reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the drawings, there is seen a spiral curling iron, generally marked by reference number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The spiral curling iron <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> works like conventional curling irons, insofar, as how the heating element can be heated. The heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is helical shaped. The helical shaped groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> allows a helical curl to be placed in the hair. The shape of the curl is three-dimensional. The circumference of the curl made in the hair is determined by the circumference of the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;length&rdquo; of the curl is governed by the length of the helical groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. By using the spiral curling iron <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, spiral curls having a consistent shape can be formed in the hair repeatedly. A handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> extends coaxially with the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is thermally insulated and allows the spiral curling iron <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be held and rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An elongated clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> overlies and applies force against the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The elongated clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> complements the helical groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A pliers-like handle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> overlies the handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and is connected to the elongated clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The hinge <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is spring loaded to urge the clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> against the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when released. When the handle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pressed, the clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> moves away from the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be added to the end of the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is distal to the handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is thermally insulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To use the spiral curling iron <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is opened by pressing the handle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A lock of hair is placed on the heating element and the handle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is released so that the lock of hair is held between the clamp <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the heating element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The spiral curling iron <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then rotated by holding the handle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and tip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lock of hair is held in the groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is thereby given the helical shape of the groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the curl is set in the hair, the handle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pressed and the curled hair is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The instant invention has been shown and described herein in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention and that obvious structural and/or functional modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
