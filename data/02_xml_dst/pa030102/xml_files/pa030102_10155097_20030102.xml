The term &ldquo;thermal vapor&rdquo; refers to a vapor phase, aerosol, or mixture of aerosol-vapor phases, formed preferably by heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Formation of NSAID Containing Aerosols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Any suitable method is used to form the aerosols of the present invention. A preferred method, however, involves heating a composition comprising an NSAID to form a vapor, followed by cooling of the vapor such that it condenses to provide an NSAID comprising aerosol (condensation aerosol). The composition is heated in one of four forms: as pure active compound (e.g., pure indomethacin, ketoprofen, celcoxib, rofecoxib, meclofenamic acid, fenoprofen, diflunisal, tolfenamic acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, or nabumetone); as a mixture of active compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient; as a salt form of the pure active compound; and, as a mixture of active compound salt form and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Salt forms of NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin, ketoprofen, celcoxib, rofecoxib, meclofenamic acid, fenoprofen, diflunisal, tolfenamic acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, or nabumetone) are either commercially available or are obtained from the corresponding free base using well known methods in the art. A variety of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are suitable for aerosolization. Such salts include, without limitation, the following: hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, formic acid, and fumaric acid salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be volatile or nonvolatile. Volatile excipients, when heated, are concurrently volatilized, aerosolized and inhaled with the NSAID. Classes of such excipients are known in the art and include, without limitation, gaseous, supercritical fluid, liquid and solid solvents. The following is a list of exemplary carriers within the classes: water; terpenes, such as menthol; alcohols, such as ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerol and other similar alcohols; dimethylformamide; dimethylacetamide; wax; supercritical carbon dioxide; dry ice; and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Solid supports on which the composition is heated are of a variety of shapes. Examples of such shapes include, without limitation, cylinders of less than 1.0 mm in diameter, boxes of less than 1.0 mm thickness and virtually any shape permeated by small (e.g., less than 1.0 mm-sized) pores. Preferably, solid supports provide a large surface to volume ratio (e.g., greater than 100 per meter) and a large surface to mass ratio (e.g., greater than 1 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per gram). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A solid support of one shape can also be transformed into another shape with different properties. For example, a flat sheet of 0.25 mm thickness has a surface to volume ratio of approximately 8,000 per meter. Rolling the sheet into a hollow cylinder of 1 cm diameter produces a support that retains the high surface to mass ratio of the original sheet but has a lower surface to volume ratio (about 400 per meter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A number of different materials are used to construct the solid supports. Classes of such materials include, without limitation, metals, inorganic materials, carbonaceous materials and polymers. The following are examples of the material classes: aluminum, silver, gold, stainless steel, copper and tungsten; silica, glass, silicon and alumina; graphite, porous carbons, carbon yarns and carbon felts; polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene glycol. Combinations of materials and coated variants of materials are used as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Where aluminum is used as a solid support, aluminum foil is a suitable material. Examples of silica, alumina and silicon based materials include amphorous silica S-5631 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), BCR171 (an alumina of defined surface area greater than 2 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g from Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and a silicon wafer as used in the semiconductor industry. Carbon yarns and felts are available from American Kynol, Inc., New York, N.Y. Chromatography resins such as octadecycl silane chemically bonded to porous silica are exemplary coated variants of silica. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The heating of the NSAID compositions is performed using any suitable method. Examples of methods by which heat can be generated include the following: passage of current through an electrical resistance element; absorption of electromagnetic radiation, such as microwave or laser light; and, exothermic chemical reactions, such as exothermic solvation, hydration of pyrophoric materials and oxidation of combustible materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Delivery of NSAID Containing Aerosols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> NSAID containing aerosols of the present invention are delivered to a mammal using an inhalation device. Where the aerosol is a condensation aerosol, the device has at least three elements: an element for heating an NSAID containing composition to form a vapor; an element allowing the vapor to cool, thereby providing a condensation aerosol; and, an element permitting the mammal to inhale the aerosol. Various suitable heating methods are described above. The element that allows cooling is, in it simplest form, an inert passageway linking the heating means to the inhalation means. The element permitting inhalation is an aerosol exit portal that forms a connection between the cooling element and the mammal&apos;s respiratory system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> One device used to deliver the NSAID containing aerosol is described in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Delivery device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a proximal end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a heating module <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a power source <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a mouthpiece <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. An NSAID composition is deposited on a surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of heating module <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Upon activation of a user activated switch <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, power source <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> initiates heating of heating module <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (e.g, through ignition of combustible fuel or passage of current through a resistive heating element). The NSAID composition volatilizes due to the heating of heating module <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and condenses to form a condensation aerosol prior to reaching the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the proximal end of the device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Air flow traveling from the device distal end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> carries the condensation aerosol to the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, where it is inhaled by the mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Devices, if desired, contain a variety of components to facilitate the delivery of NSAID containing aerosols. For instance, the device may include any component known in the art to control the timing of drug aerosolization relative to inhalation (e.g., breath-actuation), to provide feedback to patients on the rate and/or volume of inhalation, to prevent excessive use (i.e., &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo; feature), to prevent use by unauthorized individuals, and/or to record dosing histories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Dosage of NSAID Containing Aerosols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The dosage amount of an NSAID in aerosol form is generally no greater than twice the standard dose of the drug given orally; oftentimes, the dose is less than the standard oral dose. (Indomethacin, ketoprofen, celcoxib, rofecoxib, meclofenamic acid, fenoprofen, diflunisal, tolfenamic acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, or nabumetone are typically provided at the following strengths for oral administration: 25 mg, 25 to 50 mg, 100 mg, 50 mg, 200 mg, 50 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 200 mg, 50 mg, and 500 mg respectively.) A typical dosage of an NSAID aerosol is either administered as a single inhalation or as a series of inhalations taken within an hour or less (dosage equals sum of inhaled amounts). Where the drug is administered as a series of inhalations, a different amount may be delivered in each inhalation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> One can determine the appropriate dose of NSAID containing aerosols to treat a particular condition using methods such as animal experiments and a dose-finding (Phase I/II) clinical trial. One animal experiment involves measuring plasma concentrations of drug in an animal after its exposure to the aerosol. Mammals such as dogs or primates are typically used in such studies, since their respiratory systems are similar to that of a human. Initial dose levels for testing in humans is generally less than or equal to the dose in the mammal model that resulted in plasma drug levels associated with a therapeutic effect in humans. Dose escalation in humans is then performed, until either an optimal therapeutic response is obtained or a dose-limiting toxicity is encountered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Analysis of NSAID Containing Aerosols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Purity of an NSAID containing aerosol is determined using a number of methods, examples of which are described in Sekine et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Forensic Science </italic></highlight>32:1271-1280 (1987) and Martin et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Analytic Toxicology </italic></highlight>13:158-162 (1989). One method involves forming the aerosol in a device through which a gas flow (e.g., air flow) is maintained, generally at a rate between 0.4 and 60 L/min. The gas flow carries the aerosol into one or more traps. After isolation from the trap, the aerosol is subjected to an analytical technique, such as gas or liquid chromatography, that permits a determination of composition purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A variety of different traps are used for aerosol collection. The following list contains examples of such traps: filters; glass wool; impingers; solvent traps, such as dry ice-cooled ethanol, methanol, acetone and dichloromethane traps at various pH values; syringes that sample the aerosol; empty, low-pressure (e.g., vacuum) containers into which the aerosol is drawn; and, empty containers that fully surround and enclose the aerosol generating device. Where a solid such as glass wool is used, it is typically extracted with a solvent such as ethanol. The solvent extract is subjected to analysis rather than the solid (i.e., glass wool) itself. Where a syringe or container is used, the container is similarly extracted with a solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The gas or liquid chromatograph discussed above contains a detection system (i.e., detector). Such detection systems are well known in the art and include, for example, flame ionization, photon absorption and mass spectrometry detectors. An advantage of a mass spectrometry detector is that it can be used to determine the structure of NSAID degradation products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Particle size distribution of an NSAID containing aerosol is determined using any suitable method in the art (e.g., cascade impaction). An Andersen Eight Stage Non-viable Cascade Impactor (Andersen Instruments, Smyrna, Ga.) linked to a furnace tube by a mock throat (USP throat, Andersen Instruments, Smyrna, Ga.) is one system used for cascade impaction studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Inhalable aerosol mass density is determined, for example, by delivering a drug-containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the mass collected in the chamber. Typically, the aerosol is drawn into the chamber by having a pressure gradient between the device and the chamber, wherein the chamber is at lower pressure than the device. The volume of the chamber should approximate the tidal volume of an inhaling patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Inhalable aerosol drug mass density is determined, for example, by delivering a drug-containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the amount of active drug compound collected in the chamber. Typically, the aerosol is drawn into the chamber by having a pressure gradient between the device and the chamber, wherein the chamber is at lower pressure than the device. The volume of the chamber should approximate the tidal volume of an inhaling patient. The amount of active drug compound collected in the chamber is determined by extracting the chamber, conducting chromatographic analysis of the extract and comparing the results of the chromatographic analysis to those of a standard containing known amounts of drug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Inhalable aerosol particle density is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the number of particles of given size collected in the chamber. The number of particles of a given size may be directly measured based on the light-scattering properties of the particles. Alternatively, the number of particles of a given size is determined by measuring the mass of particles within the given size range and calculating the number of particles based on the mass as follows: Total number of particles&equals;Sum (from size range 1 to size range N) of number of particles in each size range. Number of particles in a given size range&equals;Mass in the size range/Mass of a typical particle in the size range. Mass of a typical particle in a given size range&equals;&pgr;*D<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>*&phgr;/6, where D is a typical particle diameter in the size range (generally, the mean boundary MMADs defining the size range) in microns, &phgr; is the particle density (in g/mL) and mass is given in units of picograms (g<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device. The delivery is for a set period of time (e.g., 3 s), and the number of particles of a given size collected in the chamber is determined as outlined above. The rate of particle formation is equal to the number of 100 nm to 5 micron particles collected divided by the duration of the collection time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Rate of aerosol formation is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device. The delivery is for a set period of time (e.g., 3 s), and the mass of particulate matter collected is determined by weighing the confined chamber before and after the delivery of the particulate matter. The rate of aerosol formation is equal to the increase in mass in the chamber divided by the duration of the collection time. Alternatively, where a change in mass of the delivery device or component thereof can only occur through release of the aerosol phase particulate matter, the mass of particulate matter may be equated with the mass lost from the device or component during the delivery of the aerosol. In this case, the rate of aerosol formation is equal to the decrease in mass of the device or component during the delivery event divided by the duration of the delivery event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Rate of drug aerosol formation is determined, for example, by delivering an NSAID containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device over a set period of time (e.g., 3 s). Where the aerosol is pure NSAID, the amount of drug collected in the chamber is measured as described above. The rate of drug aerosol formation is equal to the amount of NSAID collected in the chamber divided by the duration of the collection time. Where the NSAID containing aerosol comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, multiplying the rate of aerosol formation by the percentage of NSAID in the aerosol provides the rate of drug aerosol formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Utility of NSAID Containing Aerosols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The NSAID containing aerosols of the present invention are typically used for the treatment of inflammation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The following examples are meant to illustrate, rather than limit, the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Indomethacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamic acid sodium salt, fenoprofen calcium salt, diflunisal, tolfenamic acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and nabumetone are commercially available from SIGMA (www.sigma-aldrich.com). Celecoxib and rofecoxib can be isolated using standard methods from CELEBREX&reg; and VIOXX&reg; respectively. Other NSAIDs can be similarly obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> A solution of drug in a minimal amount of an appropriate solvent (e.g., dichloromethane or methanol) is coated on a 4.0 cm&times;7.5 cm piece of aluminum foil (precleaned with acetone). The solvent is allowed to evaporate. The coated foil is wrapped around a 300 watt halogen tube (Feit Electric Company, Pico Rivera, Calif.), which is inserted into a glass tube sealed at one end with a rubber stopper. Running 60 V of alternating current (driven by line power controlled by a variac) through the bulb for 3-18 s affords thermal vapor (including aerosol), which is collected on the glass tube walls. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis with detection by absorption of 225 nm light is used to determine the purity of the aerosol. (When desired, the system is flushed through with argon prior to volatilization.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> NSAID aerosols were obtained in the following purities and amounts using this procedure: indomethacin (99% purity, 0.61 mg); ketoprofen (100% purity, 2.72 mg); celecoxib (100% purity, 10 mg); rofecoxib (97.5% purity, 4.1 mg); meclofenamic acid (100% purity); fenoprofen (100%, 1.61 mg); diflunisal (100%, 5.47 mg); tolfenamic acid (94.2% purity, 6.49 mg); naproxen (100% purity, 4 mg); ibuprofen (100% purity, 1.81 mg); flurbiprofen (100% purity, 4.1 mg); and, nabumetone (100% purity, 4.8 mg). </paragraph>
