<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In known active matrix display devices, the column address conductors are charged using DC power. When each column is discharged, the energy held by the column is dissipated. According to the present invention, an active matrix display device is provided wherein its column driving circuitry comprises an input (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) for receiving AC power, and switching circuitry (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) for selectively connecting each of the column address conductors (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) of the display to the input (<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) to charge and discharge the column address conductors using AC power. This enables charge to be recovered by the AC power source (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) from the column address conductors (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>), thereby reducing the overall power consumption of the device. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an active matrix display device, and more particularly such a display device which is configured to consume less power than known devices of a similar size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to minimise the power consumption of portable electronic devices in order to maximise the life of their batteries. EP-A-0834763 describes an active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) which seeks to save power by recovering and reusing energy stored in the common electrode of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to reduce the power consumed by an active matrix display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an active matrix display device comprising an array of picture elements addressed by a set of row address conductors and a set of column address conductors, and column driving circuitry, wherein the column driving circuitry comprises an input for receiving AC power, and switching circuitry for selectively connecting each of the column address conductors to the input to charge and discharge the column address conductors using AC power. In known devices, the charge is lost when columns are discharged. The present arrangement enables the use of an AC power source which recovers charge from the column address conductors, thereby reducing the amount of power required by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the display device includes an LC oscillator circuit comprising inductive means and capacitive means to provide the AC power, the LC oscillator circuit having an input for selective connection to a DC supply and an output connected to the column driving circuitry input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The device may also comprise a first switching means for selectively connecting the LC oscillator circuit input to a DC supply to replace power lost from the LC oscillator circuit. Preferably, the device includes a second switching means which is operable to break the LC oscillator circuit. This serves to interrupt the oscillation of the circuit to enable the charge in the circuit to be replenished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the display device includes means for comparing the voltage of each column address conductor with the voltage at the input of the column driving circuitry, and causing the switching circuitry to connect each column address conductor to the column driving circuitry input when the compared voltages are substantially equal. Switching at this point serves to minimise any power loss due to charge redistribution between the column address conductor and the AC power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the device may include means for comparing the voltage of each column address conductor with the voltage to be applied to the next picture element to be charged by the conductor, and causing the switching circuitry to disconnect each conductor from the column driving circuitry input when the respective compared voltages are substantially equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Means may be included for correcting the voltage on each column address conductor to the voltage to be applied to the next picture element to be charged by the conductor, to substantially correct voltage variation caused by charge redistribution between a column address conductor and the next picture element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a method of driving an active matrix device of the invention as described above, the method comprising the steps of supplying AC power to the input of the column driving circuitry, and selectively connecting each of the column address conductors to the input to charge the column address conductors using the AC power.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates how a column electrode is charged in a known portable display device. Only the final output stage of the column driver circuit and the capacitance of a single electrode are shown for clarity. The column capacitance <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the electrode is connected to a DC power source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are switched on and off by control circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The column capacitance is charged to a positive voltage via transistor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and is discharged and then charged to a negative voltage via transistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The flow of charge to and from the column capacitance is indicated by arrows A and B, respectively. The charge in this system flows from the DC power source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in one direction only, and therefore energy is dissipated by the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A circuit for charging a column electrode in accordance with the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The column capacitance <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the column electrode is charged and discharged by intermittent connection thereof to an AC power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The connection is controlled so that each column electrode is switched to follow the power source voltage until the voltage desired for the electrode is reached, whereupon the electrode is disconnected from the power source. This process is governed by switching control means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which controls a switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and monitors the instantaneous power source and column capacitance voltages on lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. The flow of charge to and from the column capacitance is indicated by arrows C and D, respectively. Switch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connects or disconnects the AC power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to or from the column capacitance <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The switching control means operates the switch in such a way that switching occurs when the voltage across the column capacitance <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that across the power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to minimise power loss. This type of operation is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;zero volt switching&rdquo;. Charge flowing from the column capacitance is 90&deg; out of phase with the voltage, and so substantially all the charge on the capacitance is returned to the power source. Essentially no power is therefore dissipated, apart from resistive losses. The charging and discharging process is discussed further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a mobile device, the power source is a DC supply provided by a battery. An embodiment of a circuit which converts such a supply into an AC power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> capable of recovering energy for use in the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It comprises a DC power source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and an LC oscillator circuit formed by an inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected in parallel across the DC power source. A switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected between the positive terminal of the DC power source and a junction between the capacitor and the inductor for selectively connecting the input <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the LC oscillator circuit to the DC power source. A switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected between the inductor and the capacitor. The LC oscillator output <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to the junction between the capacitor and the inductor and provides the AC power source output for connection to the column driving circuitry. Switches <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are operated by control means within driving circuitry of the display which are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To energise the LC oscillator circuit initially, switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is closed and switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> opened. Capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is then charged by the DC power supply <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Oscillation of the circuit can be commenced by opening switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and closing switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The oscillator will oscillate with a resonant frequency f<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>,

If the capacitor is fully charged by the DC power supply, the peak to peak voltage of the oscillation will be twice the voltage across the DC power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically shows part of an active matrix liquid crystal display and associated column drive circuitry, having an input <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for connection to the output <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the LC oscillator circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The structure and operation of the active matrix display is conventional and so is not discussed in detail here. Each crossing point of the row and column electrodes of the display, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively, has an associated picture element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Each picture element comprises a switching element, such as a thin film transistor (TFT) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with its gate connected to a respective row electrode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, its source connected to a respective column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and its remaining drain terminal connected to a respective pixel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In an AMLCD, the pixel is in the form of a liquid crystal element. A combination of the stray or parasitic capacitance of each TFT <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the crossover capacitance of the row and column electrodes at each pixel is represented by a capacitor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in each picture element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, connected between the respective row and column electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Data defining an image to be displayed is fed to the display drive circuitry along line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from signal processing circuitry (not shown), one column at a time. The data for the columns is transferred onto a set of storage devices, one for each column electrode, in the form of sample and hold devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, by respective shift register elements <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The operation of the shift register elements is controlled by a shift input signal fed from the signal processing circuitry along line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A comparing means, in the form of a comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, is associated with each column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It has three inputs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> connected to the drive circuitry input <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to monitor the LC oscillator output voltage, the corresponding column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the output of the corresponding sample and hold device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, respectively. The comparator&apos;s output <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> controls a switch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the switch being operable to connect selectively the associated column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the drive circuitry input <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A correction signal is fed along line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is connected to control a set of correction switches, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, one for each column electrode. Each correction switch is connected between the output of the respective sample and hold device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the corresponding column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The operation of the circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> will now be described having regard to the exemplary waveforms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represents the voltage on the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the current flowing in inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the correction signal applied to line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> the voltage on a particular column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. W<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are the voltages on the Nth and (N&plus;1)th row electrodes of the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As with a conventional row addressing scheme, the row are addressed one at a time. The waveforms of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are shown over two row addressing periods, that is, for two consecutive rows. A half cycle oscillation of the LC oscillator is used for each row in turn. Initially, the image information for a single row is shifted onto the sample and hold devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, using the shift registers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. During this period, the switches <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are open to isolate the respective column electrodes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from the AC power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The power source is in a holding state at this point, with switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> closed and switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> open, so that capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is charged by the DC power source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The charging process will now be discussed in relation to the particular column electrode for which the corresponding waveform, W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The process is considered for consecutive rows, N and N&plus;1. It will be appreciated that a similar procedure will occur for each column of the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The LC oscillator is switched into an oscillation mode by opening switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and closing switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. At this time, an addressing pulse is applied to the row electrode for row N of the display, turning on the associated row of TFTs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This causes the voltages on each of the column electrodes to be applied to the respective LC elements <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in row N. The capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> begins to discharge through the inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> monitors the voltage on the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the column capacitance via lines <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, respectively. When the two voltages are substantially identical, the comparator closes switch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to connect the column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the AC power source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (point a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Switching should occur at this point, otherwise charge redistribution between the column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> would result in a significant loss of power. In other words, switching takes place when the power supply reaches the voltage at which the column was disconnected during the addressing of row N&minus;1. The column capacitance then discharges in parallel with the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> until all the energy they stored is transferred to the inductor&apos;s magnetic field. The period during which the capacitor is discharging up to this point is identified as N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> At this stage, the inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> continues to drive a current. The capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the column electrode therefore charge to the opposite voltage during period N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to that of N<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> continues to monitor the column voltage and compares it to the image data stored on the sample and hold device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. When these values are substantially the same, the column electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is isolated by the comparator causing switch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to open. This occurs at point b in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Energy transfer from the inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> continues until all the energy is stored on the capacitor at the end of period N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. At this point, the oscillation of the LC circuit is stopped by opening the switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Some energy will be lost due to charge redistribution as the LC element capacitance is switched into parallel with the column capacitance. The switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is closed at this stage (point c in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) by the application of a correction pulse <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (see waveform W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) on line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. This causes the sample and hold device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to drive the column electrode in order to correct for any drop in the voltage thereon caused by this charge redistribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As noted above, some charge may be lost from the LC oscillator circuit, due to resistive losses for example. The oscillator circuit may therefore be restarted periodically. Its oscillation can be stopped by opening switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the capacitor can then be charged and replenished from the DC power source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by closing switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably opened when all the system energy is stored by the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, that is, when the current through the inductor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is zero, to avoid harmful voltage spikes caused by the rapid collapse in the magnetic field associated with the current carrying inductor when it is uncoupled from the capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The charging process is repeated for each picture element in the next row of the display, row N&plus;1, charging it to the opposite polarity, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. It can be seen that a row inversion scheme can be implemented, with a swing in the polarity of the voltage across the capacitor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> charging one row one way, and then the subsequent reverse swing of the capacitor voltage charging the following row the other way. Thus, the majority of the energy lost from the LC oscillator is replaced during a two row cycle. Alternatively, a pixel inversion scheme could be adopted by charging alternate LC elements on the same row with one swing and the other elements on the reverse swing, or by using two LC oscillators to charge alternate LC elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Whilst the invention is described above in relation to an AMLCD, it will be appreciated that the invention may be employed in other types of active matrix display device, such as plasma display devices and organic light emitting diode display devices. </paragraph>
