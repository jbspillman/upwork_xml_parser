<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention is a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF) capable of monitoring fast processes. More particularly, it is a TOF for monitoring the elution from an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) operated at pressures between a few Torr and atmospheric pressure. This apparatus is an instrument for qualitative and/or quantitative chemical and biological analysis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is an increasing need for mass analysis of fast processes, which in part, arises from the popularity of fast multi-dimensional separations techniques like GC-TOF, Mobility-TOF, or EM-TOF, (electron monochromator) etc. In those methods, the TOF serves as a mass monitor scanning the elution of the analyte of the prior separation methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are numerous other fields of application involving the investigation of fast kinetic processes. Two examples are the chemical processes during gas discharges, and photon or radiofrequency induced chemical and plasma ion etching. In the case of gas discharges one may monitor the time evolution of products before, during and after the abrupt interruption of a continuous gas discharge or during and after the pulsed initiation of the discharge. An analogous monitoring of the chemical processes in a plasma etching chamber can be performed. The time profile of chemical products released from a surface into a plasma can be determined either during and after the irradiation with laser pulses or before, during and after the application of a voltage which induces etching (e.g., RF plasma processing). A third such example is the time evolution of ions either directly desorbed from a surface by energetic beams of X-ray, laser photons, electrons, or ions. In addition, when the ions are desorbed from a surface there is usually a more predominant codesorption of non-ionized neutral elements and molecules whose time evolution can be monitored by first post ionizing neutral species which have been desorbed and then measuring mass separated time evolution of the ions by mass spectrometry. Yet a fourth area of use is the monitoring of the time evolution of neutral elements or molecules reflected after a molecular beam is impinged on a surface. The importance of such studies range from fundamental studies of molecular dynamics at surfaces to the practical application of molecular beam epitaxy to grow single crystalline semiconductor devices. A further application for fast analysis is presented by Fockenberg et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In all such studies the time evolution of ion signals which have been mass resolved in a mass spectrometer is crucial. TOF instruments have become the instrument of choice for broad range mass analysis of fast processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> TOF instruments typically operate in a semi-continuous repetitive mode. In each cycle of a typical instrument, ions are first generated and extracted from an ion source (which can be either continuous or pulsed) and then focused into a parallel beam of ions. This parallel beam is then injected into an extractor section comprising a parallel plate and grid. The ions are allowed to drift into this extractor section for some length of time, typically 5 &mgr;s. The ions in the extractor section are then extracted by a high voltage pulse into a drift section followed by reflection by an ion mirror, after which the ions spend additional time in the drift region on their flight to a detector. The time-of-flight of the ions from extraction to detection is recorded and used to identify their mass. Typical times-of-flight of the largest ions of interest are in the range of 20 &mgr;s to 200 &mgr;s. Hence, the extraction frequencies are usually in the range of 5 kHz to 50 kHz. If an extraction frequency of 50 kHz is used, the TOF is acquiring a full mass spectrum every 20 &mgr;s. After each extraction, it takes some finite time for the ions of the primary beam to fill up the extraction chamber. This so-called fill up time is typically relatively shorter for lighter ions as compared to heavier ions because they travel faster in the primary beam. For light ions, the fill up time may be as short as 1 &mgr;s whereas for very large ions, the fill up time may exceed the 20 &mgr;s between each extraction, and hence those large ions never completely fill up the extraction region. The fill up time depends on the ion energy in the primary beam, the length of the extraction region and the mass of the ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some fast processes, however, require monitoring with a time resolution in the microsecond range. For example, a species eluting from an ion mobility spectrometer may elute through the orifice within a time interval of 15 &mgr;s. If this species also has a small fill up time it is possible that this elution occurs between two TOF extractions in such a way that the TOF completely misses the eluting species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Known techniques to solve this problem are based on increasing the extraction frequency. In general, the ion flight time in the TOF section will determine the maximum extraction frequency, shorter flight times yielding higher extraction rates. The ion flight time is shortened by either increasing the ion energy in the drift section, or by reducing the length of the drift section. Increasing the ion energy is the preferred method, because decreasing the drift length results in a loss of resolving power. However, because the relationship between ion energy E and the time-of-flight T is a square-root dependence, an increase in energy only leads to a minimal decrease in flight time:

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention consists of an apparatus comprising an ion source for repetitively generating ions, an ion extractor fluidly coupled to the ion source and extracting ions from it for time-of-flight measurement in a time-of-flight mass section. A position sensitive ion detector is fluidly coupled to the time-of-flight mass section to detect the ions. The apparatus also has a timing controller in electronic communication with the ion source and the ion extractor. The timing controller tracks and controls the time of activation of the ion source and activates the ion extractor according to a predetermined sequence. A data processing unit for analyzing and presenting data said data processing unit is in electronic communication with the ion source, the ion extractor, and the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, the predetermined sequence includes a time offset between the activation of the ion source and the activation of the ion extractor. This time offset may be variable. Typical time offset ranges from 0 to 1000 &mgr;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another specific embodiment includes an adjustment means for adjusting the kinetic energies of said ions upon entering said extractor according to their mass. In yet another embodiment, the apparatus has a position sensitive ion detector having a meander delay line. In specific embodiments, the detector may have multiple meander delay lines. The position sensitive ion detector may have multiple anodes. In a specific embodiment, the multiple anode detector may have anodes of different size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the instant invention is a method of determining the temporal profile of fast ion processes. This is accomplished by generating ions in an ion source, controlling and tracking the time of the step of generating by a timing controller, and activating extraction of said ions in a single or repetitive manner according to a predetermined sequence. The extracted ions are then separated in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and detected with a position sensitive ion detector capable of resolving the location of impact of the ion onto the detector. The ions are then analyzed to determine the time characteristics of the fast ion processes from the ion impact location information, the time from the step of tracking, and the time of activation of the extractor. The temporal profile of the fast ion processes is thus determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In specific method embodiments, the steps of generating and activating extraction include a time offset between them. The time offset may be varied. Typical time offset ranges are from 0 to 1000 &mgr;s. In a specific embodiment the kinetic energy of the ions is adjusted before the step of extracting. The position sensitive ion detector may be a meander delay line detector. In a specific embodiment, the position sensitive ion detector may have multiple meander delay lines. The position sensitive ion detector may comprise multiple anodes. In a specific multiple anode embodiment, the detector may have one or more anodes of different size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus comprises an ion source capable of repetitively generating ions and an ion extractor fluidly coupled to the ion source which extracts the ions for time-of-flight measurement in a time-of-flight mass section. An ion detector is fluidly coupled to said time-of-flight mass section to detect the ions and a timing controller is in electronic communication with the ion source and the ion extractor. The timing controller tracks and controls the time of activation of the ion source and activates the ion extractor according to a predetermined sequence, the sequence having a time offset between the activation of said ion source and the activation of said ion extractor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method of determining the temporal profile of fast ion processes comprises generating ions from an ion source and extracting the ions in a single or repetitive manner. A timing controller activates the generation and extraction of the ions. The timing controller operates according to a predetermined sequence and also effects a time offset between the step of activating and the step of extracting. The ions are then separated according to their time-of-flight in a time-of-flight mass section and detected. The time characteristics of the fast ion processes are analyzed from the time of the various steps of activating, extracting, and detecting. In this way, the temporal profile of the fast ion processes is determined.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The following discussion contains illustration and examples of preferred embodiments for practicing the present invention. However, they are not limiting examples. Other examples and methods are possible in practicing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As used herein the specification, &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;an&rdquo; may mean one or more. As used herein in the claim(s), when used in conjunction with the word &ldquo;comprising&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;an&rdquo; may mean one or more than one. As used herein &ldquo;another&rdquo; may mean at least a second or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;fluidly coupled&rdquo;, refers to the relationship wherein two components are linked, i.e., as where the output of one of the components is input for the other component. One skilled in the art recognizes that although this linkage may be a physical connection, this is not essential. For example, assuming two components (A and B), if the output of component A becomes (either immediately or at some later point) input for component B, or alternatively, if the output of component B becomes (either immediately or at some later point) input for component A, then components A and B are &ldquo;fluidly coupled&rdquo;. One example of such output may be the mobility-separated ions exiting an ion mobility cell, while an example of such input may be the mobility-separated ions entering a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As defined herein, &ldquo;interleaved timing sequence&rdquo; is defined as a timing sequence that controls an interleaved data acquisition. Interleaved data acquisition refers to a method where the data points of a time series are reconstructed from measurements of several passes through the series. For example, the odd data points of a time series may be acquired in the first pass (i.e. data points <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, . . . ) and the even data points are acquired in the second pass (data points <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, . . . ). The essence of the interleaved method is the time offset between ion generation and ion extraction. The different data time points are collected through the use of such a time offset. Interleaved timing is therefore synonymous with a time offset between ion generation and extraction. In this way, the temporal profile is thus reconstructed. The time offset <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an interleaved timing sequence where the time series is composed from acquisitions from 8 passes. The actual times in any analysis may vary from the illustrated values in the figure. The range of times can be large and generally vary from 0 to 1000 &mgr;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;IMS&rdquo; is defined as an ion mobility spectrometer. An ion mobility spectrometer is consists of a drift tube in which ions traveling in a gaseous medium in the presence of an electric field are separated according to their ion mobilities. The ion mobilities of specific ion species are result from the conditions of drift tube pressure and potential of the ion mobility experiment. The repetitive accelerations in the electric field and collisions at the molecular level result in unique ion mobilities for different ion species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;IMS/MS&rdquo; is. a combination of an ion mobility spectrometer and a mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometer separates and analyzes ions under the influence of a potential according to their mass to charge ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;IMS/IFP/MS&rdquo; is a combination of an ion mobility spectrometer and a mass spectrometer with an ion fragmentation process between them. The ion fragmentation process can be any of those commonly known in the mass spectrometric art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;position sensitive ion detector&rdquo;, or PSD, is defined as an ion detector having the ability to detect the location of the analyte species within the detector at the time of detection. This is contrasted to detectors in which only the presence but not the location of the analyte within the detector is detected. The term &ldquo;position sensitive ion detector&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;position sensitive detection means&rdquo; and &ldquo;position sensitive detector&rdquo; and may include, but is not limited to, meander delay line detectors, multiple meander delay line detectors, and multi-anode detectors in which the individual anodes may be of the same or different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;time resolving power&rdquo; is defined as the time of ion release by a process and the accuracy with which this release time can be determined. This is expressed mathematically as T/AT where T is the time of ion release in the process and AT is the accuracy of the measurement of T. It is used synonymously with &ldquo;temporal resolving power&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;TOF&rdquo; is defined as a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A TOF is a type of mass spectrometer in which ions are all accelerated to the same kinetic energy into a field-free region wherein the ions acquire a velocity characteristic of their mass-to-charge ratios. Ions of differing velocities separate and are detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Instruments employing either the interleaved method, the position sensitive detector method, or a combination of both, require a source of ions. In some cases, the temporal development of the ion generation itself is analyzed. For example, the kinetics of the formation of a chemical ion species during a discharge may be investigated. In other cases, a chemical or physical process that does not generate ions but only neutral particles may be under investigation. In this case these neutral particles will have to be ionized for the analysis. The analysis of neutral species in a chemical reaction is an example for such an application. In still another case, the temporal release of existing ions may be of interest. This is, for example, the case in an ion mobility spectrometer wherein the temporal elution of ions at the end of the mobility spectrometer is monitored in order to get information about the mobility of these ions. Any and all instruments and methods for creating or releasing ions are collectively referred to as &ldquo;ion sources&rdquo; herein. The interleaved timing sequence is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> may be used with the basic instrumental platform of the present invention as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The only variable is the pulsing scheme that is generated by the timing controller (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). The interleaved timing scheme is applicable in situations where a repetitive process must be mass analyzed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is the specific case wherein a mobility spectrometer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is used as the source of such an ion process. Some ion mobility spectrometers separate ions on a very short time scale; i.e., just a few microseconds. Hence, to identify the ions eluting from the ion mobility spectrometer, the TOF has to detect those ions and resolve their mobility drift time. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ions eluting from the IMS are accelerated immediately into a primary beam (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of an energy of 20 to 200 eV in order to minimize the time to travel from the IMS exit orifice (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) to the TOF extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). The ions then pass through the extraction chamber. When the timing controller (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) issues an ion extraction, the ion will be mass analyzed and its mobility drift time is identified with the time at which the extraction occurs. The interleaved timing scheme allows the scanning of the ions in the primary beam (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). An ion species that passed through the extractor without being extracted and detected in one mobility spectrum will be detected in a following mobility spectrum. This is accomplished by varying the time offset between the start of the mobility process at (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the TOF extraction sequence at (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>), as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There are variations available in the operation of the ion extractor (i.e., the extraction chamber) (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an orthogonal extractor is illustrated. An orthogonal extractor extracts the ions in orthogonal direction to their initial flight direction in the primary ion beam (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Other types of TOF function with a coaxial extraction. For example, the interleaved method works with both orthogonal and coaxial extractors. The ion extractor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> uses a double pulsed extractor. In this embodiment, the back plate of the extraction chamber as well as the second grid are pulsed by a high voltage pulser (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). In other extraction chambers, only one electrode is pulsed, e.g. only the back plate or only the first grid. Alternatively, the ions are not extracted by a pulsed electric field, but by a fast creation of the ions within the extractor (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). In this case, the electric field is always present, and the particles enter the extraction region (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) as neutrals. A pulsed ionizing beam, e.g. an electron beam or a laser beam, is then used to simultaneously create and extract the ions. In other embodiments, the extracting field is slightly delayed with respect to the ion generation step in order to improve the time focussing properties of the TOF instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The ion detector is used to create the stop signal of the time-of-flight measurement. The most common detectors used in TOF are electron multiplier detectors, where the ion to be detected generates one or several electrons by collision with an active surface. An acceleration and secondary electron production process then multiplies each electron. This electron multiplication cycle is repeated several times until the resulting electron current is large enough to be detected by conventional electronics. Some more exotic detectors detect the ion energy deposited in a surface when the ion impinges on the detector. Some other detectors make use of the signal electrically induced by the ion in an electrode. Any and all of these apparatuses and corresponding methods of ion detection, which are discussed in detail in the literature and known to those of ordinary skill in the art, are collectively referred to as &ldquo;ion detector&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Two different and independent methods (as well as their combination) for obtaining high time resolving power for ion analysis by TOF are disclosed. The first method includes an interleaved timing scheme and the second method uses a position sensitive detector. Both of these methods allow one to obtain temporal information of the fast ion processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 1) Interleaved Method: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The interleaved timing scheme is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> and may be used with the instrumental platform shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The critical variable is the pulsing scheme that is generated by the timing controller (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). The interleaved timing scheme is applicable to mass analysis of any repetitive process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the ion output of a mobility spectrometer (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is such a process. The pressures in the ion mobility region (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are typically a few Torr to approximately atmospheric pressures. Some ion mobility spectrometers separate ions on a very short time scale i.e., less than 100 &mgr;s. Hence, to identify the ions eluting from the ion mobility spectrometer, the TOF has to detect those ions and resolve their mobility drift time. The ions eluting from the IMS through an orifice (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) are accelerated immediately into a primary beam (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) to a energy of 20 to 200 eV in order to minimize the time to travel from the IMS exit orifice (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) to the TOF extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). The pressure in region (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is typically on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The ions then enter the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). When the timing controller (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) issues an ion extraction, the ions will be mass analyzed in flight tube (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) and their mobility drift time is identified with the time at which the extraction occurred. The pressures in the flight tube region are typically on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The interleaved timing scheme allows scanning the primary beam ion arrival times in the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) relative to the time they were generated in the ion source (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Ion species that pass through the extractor without being extracted and detected in one mobility spectrum will be detected in a following mobility spectrum. This is accomplished by variation of the time offset between the start of the mobility process (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the TOF extraction sequence, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates how the offset between the ion production (by laser) and the ion extraction sequence is increased by 5 &mgr;s (the interleaved time) for each ion production cycle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the same sequence in greater detail. Here, the time delay until the first ion exits the mobility chamber is also indicated, as well as a laser recovery time, e.g., the time between the end of the mobility spectrum and the time at which a new laser pulse can be issued. The laser recovery time is largely time lost during the delay for the laser to recover for a new ion production cycle. The laser recovery time is variable. One skilled in the art recognizes that the laser recovery time is dependent upon the specific laser used. In general, times shown in the figures are illustrative and a number of lasers exhibiting a wide range of recovery times may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In general, the range of offset times extends from zero to the time between two extractions. This is illustrated schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Ideally, the extraction frequency is maximized in order to maximize data collection. However, this is limited by the mass and energy of the ions of interest and the instrumental flight path length. Once an extraction frequency is chosen, the offset range is automatically determined, ranging from 0 to the time corresponding to one extraction cycle. Data collection is then modified by choosing a different step size of the offset (interleaved time) within the offset range. In order to insure that no part of the time profile of the process under study goes unmonitored, this step size cannot larger than the maximum offset range. The smaller the step size, the greater the temporal resolution of the data, however, this comes at the expense of longer data collection times. For example, if the extraction frequency is 10 kHz, the time between two extractions is 100 &mgr;s. If, for example, a 5 step interleaved sequence is chosen within that range, the step size will be 20 &mgr;s. In this example, the offset pattern will be 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 &mgr;s. An offset range of 0 to 1000 &mgr;s is expected to cover most ion processes, corresponding to extraction frequencies down to 1 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The smallest mobility drift time differences that can be detected with this method corresponds to the &ldquo;filling time&rdquo; of the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). This filling time is the time it takes an ion species to pass through the open extraction area. The differential filling time effect on ions entering the ion extractor at different times is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. An ion with a short mobility drift time will enter the extraction chamber early and at the time of extraction it will have moved in the extraction chamber to an extraction position (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Another ion with a slightly longer mobility time will enter the extraction chamber later and at the moment of extraction it may be at a different position (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The mobility drift time of those two ions cannot be distinguished easily with instruments of the prior art; applying an interleaved timing mode helps to alleviate this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> 2) The PSD Method (Position Sensitive Ion Detection) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The instruments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> include position sensitive ion detectors (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), respectively, which allow one to distinguish between the ion extracted at a first position (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and the ion extracted at a second position (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The ability to distinguish these ions is based upon the different locations at which these ions impinge upon the detector. These different locations are schematically shown as (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), respectively. The use of the position sensitive ion detector (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, respectively, improves the time resolution to less than the extraction fill time. The detector (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a multi-anode detector with limited position resolving capabilities but high count rate capabilities. Detector (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a meander delay line based position sensitive ion detector (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,644,128 of Wollnik; expressly incorporated by reference herein) with high position resolving power in at least one dimension, but with limited count rate capability. The preferred embodiment of the present invention would utilize a combination of these two detectors by using several delay line anodes (multiple meander delay lines) in order to obtain good position resolving power and high count rate capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The primary disadvantage of using this method with position sensitive ion detectors is their mass dependent resolution. Heavier ions are slower; hence their fill time is longer compared to the fill time of lighter ions. Heavier ions may not be able to travel far into the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) before the next extraction occurs. For those ions it would be an advantage to have better position resolving power at the beginning of the detector. The following example illustrates the problem. Assuming that all primary beam ions (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) enter the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) at more or less equal kinetic energies per charge (E/z), an ion of m/z&equals;100 Daltons may have a fill time of 10 &mgr;s. In this case, a heavier ion with m/z&equals;10,000 will have a fill time of 100 &mgr;s. Hence, at a 50 kHz extraction frequency which corresponds to one extraction every 20 &mgr;s, the 100 Dalton ions will overfill the extraction chamber, whereas the 10,000 Dalton ions will only fill the first {fraction (1/5)}th of the extraction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to exploit the PSD fast acquisition method, the PSD requires a good position resolving capability in this first {fraction (1/5)}th of the detector (at position <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). At the other end of the PSD (around position <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), poorer position resolving capability may not be as detrimental to overall performance. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and the following mathematical treatment illustrates how the present invention allows one to reconstruct the mobility drift time t<highlight><subscript>mob </subscript></highlight>from the time of extraction t<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. The mobility process is initiated by a pulsed laser (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) at time t&equals;0. After the drift time t<highlight><subscript>mob </subscript></highlight>the ion appears at the exit orifice (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) of the mobility cell. From there it takes the ion a certain time, t<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>to travel to the beginning (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) of the open area in the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). There, the ion passes through the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) for a certain time t<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>until at time t<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>an extraction occurs. At that time, the ion is at position (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), which is the length s further inside the beginning (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) of the open area in the extraction chamber (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). This position is monitored with the position sensitive ion detector (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>). Hence the mobility drift time is: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The parameters a, b, c and d are instrumental parameters that depend on the TOF geometry and the potentials applied. Once those parameters are known, the mobility time t<highlight><subscript>mob </subscript></highlight>can be calculated with the m/z information from the time-of-flight measurement and the distance s information from position sensitive ion detector with the process indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> This treatment is applicable not only for IMS-TOF combinations, but for the monitoring of any fast processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the transit time, t<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>, is reduced by reducing the distance between the mobility cell exit (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and the beginning of the open extractor area (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), and by accelerating the ions within this region. As a result, the differences in the transit time t<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>may become insignificant and the parameter b may remain unknown. In other words, instead of determining the mobility time, t<highlight><subscript>mob </subscript></highlight>it is often sufficient to determine the time t<highlight><subscript>mob</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Equation (3) also indicates that for ions with large m/z, the penetration into the extraction chamber is slow. Many of the larger ions will experience extraction early upon entry into the extraction chamber. A multi-anode detector configuration is helpful in improving position resolving power. Further, when using a multi-anode position sensitive detector (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), it is desirable to have smaller anodes in the area (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in order to increase the position resolving power for large m/z ions impinging in this area. This will maintain a process time resolving power for those large m/z ions. One skilled in the art recognizes that larger m/z ions will travel slowly from position (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to position (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) than would smaller m/z ions. Potentially, these slower traveling ions may never reach position (5) because a new extraction event will occur before this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the special case of monitoring the elution from a mobility cell, light ions will always appear in the extraction chamber early and heavier ions will appear later. This is because there is a strong correlation between ion mobility elution time and ion mass. Hence it is possible to increase the ion energy in the primary beam (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) during the elution of the mobility spectrum in this case so that the ion velocity in the primary beam stays approximately constant. Ramping up an accelerating potential somewhere in the primary beam optics (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) accomplishes this. In this way, the full area of the position sensitive ion detector is used at any time. This velocity correction method, however, cannot be used with IMS/IFP/MS. IMS/IFP/MS is the tandem method where ions are fragmented after the mobility separation, e.g. in region (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), prior to the TOF extraction. This fragmentation may be induced by gas collisions, by collisions with surfaces, or by bombardment with fragmenting beams i.e., an electron or photon beam. In this case, the correlation between mobility and mass is lost due to the fragmentation process creating light ions from ions with low mobility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> One example of a TOF instrument with PSD detection is as follows. An ion source repetitively generates ions. Ions from the ion source enter an ion extractor which extracts ions for time-of-flight measurement in a time-of-flight mass section. The ion extractor is fluidly coupled to the ion source. A position sensitive ion detector is fluidly coupled to the time-of-flight mass section to detect the ions issuing from it. A timing controller is in electronic communication with the ion source and the ion extractor and tracks and controls the time of activation of the ion source and activates the ion extractor according to a predetermined sequence. A data processing unit for analyzing and presenting data said data processing unit is in electronic communication with the ion source, the ion extractor, and the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The TOF/PSD instrument can be modified to incorporate an interleaved timing scheme to produce a interleaved TOF/PSD instrument. This is accomplished by including a time offset between the activation of the ion source and the activation of the ion extractor. The time offset may be variable. Typical time offset ranges are from 0 to 1000 &mgr;s. The interleaved/PSD combination would yield instruments and methods having the advantages of both technologies. The position sensitive ion detection method can be used in any TOF design with spatial imaging properties, e.g. a linear TOF design or in a TOF design with multiple reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the instrument of the previous paragraph could be modified to replace the PSD with an ion detector lacking position sensitivity. The result would be an interleaved-TOF instrument. While lacking the benefits of the PSD, such an instrument may be acceptable for analyses involving ions having a narrow spread of generation times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The TOF/PSD instrument can possess a number of different features and variations. An adjustment means for adjusting the kinetic energies of the ions upon entering said extractor according to their mass. The PSD may be based upon the meander delay line technique. Such a meander delay line detector may have multiple meander delay lines. The position sensitive ion detector may have also multiple anodes. If a multiple anode detector is used, it may have anodes of the same or differing sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Analytical methods can be based on the TOF/PSD instrument to determine the temporal profile of fast ion processes. This is accomplished by generating ions in an ion source, tracking the time of ion generation by a timing controller, and activating the extraction of the ions in a single or repetitive manner according to a predetermined sequence. The extracted ions are then separated in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and detected with a position sensitive ion detector capable of resolving the location of impact of the ions onto the detector. The ions are then analyzed to determine the time characteristics of the fast ion processes from the ion impact location information, the time from the step of tracking, and the time of activation of the extractor. The temporal profile of the fast ion processes is thus determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In methods employing interleaved timing in addition to the TOF/PSD measurement, the steps of generating and activating extraction include a time offset between them. The time offset may be varied. Typical time offset ranges are from 0 to 1000 &mgr;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the method of the previous paragraph could be modified to replace the PSD with an ion detector lacking position sensitivity. The result would be an interleaved-TOF method. While lacking the benefits of analogous methodology employing a PSD, these methods may be acceptable for analyses involving ions having a narrow spread of generation times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Variations and additional features to this general method are possible. In a specific embodiment, the kinetic energy of the ions is adjusted before the ion extraction. The position sensitive ion detector may be a meander delay line detector. It may have multiple meander delay lines. The position sensitive ion detector may comprise multiple anodes, wherein the multiple anodes may be of the same or different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Importantly, each instrument and method can be applied to any fast separation process, not being limited to IMS and can be used with ADC (analog-to-digital converter) or TDC (time-to-digital converter) detection schemes. </paragraph>
