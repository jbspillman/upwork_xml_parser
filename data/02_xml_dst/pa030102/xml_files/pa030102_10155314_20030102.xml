</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a formulation having desirable properties built upon synergistic ingredients; maintaining low simple sugar levels; and slowing down the normally rapid absorption of simple sugars from the gut. This objective best optimizes energy levels by thwarting the potential destabilizing effects on blood sugar and insulin response, by preferably utilizing a polysaccharide matrix of complex carbohydrates and soluble gum fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention provides numerous advantages not found in other agents including, but not limited to, limiting the excessive use of ingredients, such as sugar, that may promote greater oxidative stress and actually reduce energy. Ingredients are preferably chosen from among those that neutralize and inhibit free radical production and oxidative stress and, therefore, help to protect the cellular energy generating mechanisms. Moreover, presently preferred ingredients are those that assist in the cellular utilization and burning of fuels for energy. The composition of the invention also provides multiple tiered use of various timed caloric energy fuels plus the sweetness system disclosed herein for longer, sustained energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a composition of active and, optionally, inactive ingredients. The composition can be prepared in any form including, but not limited to, dry formulations, aqueous formulations, and the like. The composition of the invention can be included in substantially any manufactured foodstuff or beverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A presently preferred embodiment of the composition includes one or more polyphenolic compounds. While not being bound to any particular theory of operation, the inventors presently prefer polyphenolic compounds that inhibit the digestive enzymes amylase (starch digestion) and sucrase (sugar digestion), thereby slowing sugar absorption, and reducing overstimulation of the insulin response, and the subsequent modification of sugar metabolism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, preferred polyphenolic compounds inhibit the activity of the bacterial enzyme, glucan transferase, which metabolizes simple sugars as found in beverages, into sticky dental plaque. Without the sticky plaque present, the bacteria cannot adhere to the tooth surfaces, ferment the sugars into acids, and create dental caries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Polyphenolic compounds of use in the present invention are isolated from any convenient source. Preferred polyphenolic compounds include catechins, tannin extracts, extracts of <highlight><italic>Camellia Sinensis </italic></highlight>(e.g., green and black teas), and those found in cranberry, aronia berry, bilberry, and grape seed. Other useful sources of polyphenolic compounds will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferred green tea and black teas actives are the catechins and the aflavins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The polyphenols can be present in the formulation in any useful amount, but they are preferably present in an amount of from about 0.2 mg to about 500 mg in 8 oz of water or other diluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The formulation of the invention also preferably includes one or more amino acid or source of amino acid is preferably selected from is soy, soy sprouts or other legume derived proteins such as mung bean, or dairy based protein, amino chelated minerals, and whey or other dairy-based proteins. Other useful sources of amino acid are known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The amino acids of use in the present invention are preferably free glycine and arginine, which lower blood sugar levels by virtue of mild inducement of insulin release from the pancreas. Arginine, independent of insulin release, also stimulates release of GH (growth hormone) from the pituitary gland. GH is a natural counterbalance to the excessive hypoglycemic effects of insulin. Moreover, glycine, independent of energy dynamics, is an amino acid neurotransmitter substrate, that is described in the scientific literature as being inhibitory to neurological hyperactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thus, a presently preferred source of amino acid is soy protein, which is a rich source of glycine and arginine, improves glucose tolerance and peripheral insulin sensitivity which is crucial for blood sugar stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The one or more amino acid can be present in the composition in any useful amount, but is preferably present in an amount of from about 5 mg to about 7 grams per 8 ounces of water or other diluent. When the amino acid is provided by a source of amino acid, other than the free amino acid, the source is preferably present in an amount that provides the preferred amount of the free amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Also present in preferred formulations of the invention is soluble fiber, preferably active soluble fiber. As used herein, &ldquo;active soluble fiber&rdquo; refers to soluble fiber that is biologically responsive to bacteria in the mammalian GI tract and/or participate in one or more blood sugar modifying mechanism in vivo. The soluble fiber is from any source, however, preferred fibers are those that participate in one or more blood sugar modifying mechanism, such as: conversion of the soluble fiber into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by the intestinal bacteria (SCFA, particularly propionic acids, increase glycolysis and reduces gluconeogenesis thus normalizing blood sugar); and (2) slowing of the absorption of sugar from the intestinal tract by the soluble fiber, which ultimately influences the rate of sugar metabolism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Additionally, antioxidants, including phenolic-based botanical extracts are optionally included as a component of the present formulation. The presence of the antioxidant can aid in overcoming or blunting the pro-oxidant and destabilizing hypoglycemic effects of quickly absorbed simple sugars found in most commercial beverages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Presently preferred soluble fibers having the above-described characteristics include, inulin, FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides e.g., Beflora&trade;), and gums. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The soluble fiber is present in any useful amount, but is preferably present in an amount of from about 100 mg to about 8 grams per 8 ounces of water or other diluent. In those embodiment in which 5 grams or more soluble fiber is present, the composition of the invention is preferably able to reduce the post prandial rise in blood sugar levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the formulation includes one or more zinc salt or other source of the zinc ion. Metabolically, zinc is a critical nutrient in the synthesis of insulin and the metabolism of carbohydrates. From a dental perspective, cariogenic bacteria enzymatically produce an insoluble glucan deposit from simple sugars present in the mouth that firmly adheres to the enamel tooth surface. Original study at UCSF School of Preventive Dentistry by the present inventors, demonstrated that two tested zinc salts, 0.5% zinc solution (zinc chloride) and same concentration of zinc ascorbate, both inhibited the growth and adherence of mutans streptococci and sobrinus streptococci in vitro. This demonstrates that the zinc cation, not the counter ion, is the most significant portion of the salt molecule for this function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferred sources of the zinc ion include zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc ascorbate, zinc picolinate, zinc amino acid chelates, and zinc-EDTA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The zinc salt(s)or source(s) is present in any useful quantity, but is preferably present in an amount of from about 1 mg to about 40 mg per 8 ounces of water or other diluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the invention provides an acidic finished drink composition. The drink is preferably water-based. The water used to formulate the drink can be, for example, still, carbonated, or dairy-based. The pH of the finished drink is preferably from about 1 to about 7, more preferably from about 1 to about 5, and more preferably from about 1 to about 3. The solubility and assimilation of mineral salts, especially divalent minerals such as calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, are enhanced in an acidic medium. These elements have many important roles relating to cellular metabolism and tissue structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The acid or source of acid includes both organic and inorganic acids. Exemplary organic acids include, citric, lactic, tartaric, malic, and ascorbic. Exemplary inorganic acids include phosphoric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The source of the sugars relevant to the operation of the composition of the invention can be contained in the inventive formulation itself, or they may be derived from other foodstuffs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also provided by the present invention is a method for modulating sugar metabolism in a mammalian subject. The method includes administering to the subject a composition of the invention, thereby modulating sugar metabolism of the subject. In a preferred embodiment, the moderating results in a decrease of the rate of sugar metabolism relative to the rate in the absence of a composition of the invention. In another preferred embodiment, the moderating includes a linearization of the rate of metabolism, eliminating spikes and/or valleys in the sugar metabolism profile, and/or decreasing the peak height and/or valley depth in the sugar metabolism profile. In another preferred embodiment, the sugar metabolism is modulating by the composition effecting a decrease in the absorption rate of the sugar by the mammalian gut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The following examples is provided by way of illustration only and not by way of limitation. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters that could be changed or modified to yield essentially similar results.</paragraph>
