<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A rotary engine utilizes an expansion chamber and crescent piston to capture the energy of expanding combustion gases through out substantially all of each revolution of the piston. The rotary engine uses a crescent piston, the movement of which is guided by the combined action of a hub having a saddle supporting the piston and a can track. The invention burns fuel in a separate combustion chamber charged from a coaxially mounted compressor and controlled by a pass gate sentry valve. The rotary engine of the invention is cooled by an internal coolant injection system. The coolant solution may contain a alkaline reagent to react with and neutralize acidic components of the combustion gases which would otherwise remain in the exhaust and contribute to air pollution. The rotary engine of the present invention is adaptable to compression ignition fuels and spark ignition fuels. The invention may be constructed of conventional metallic materials as well as composites and ceramics. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The generally invention relates to internal combustion engines and, more particularly, to a piston driven rotary-type internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Engine designers are constantly endeavoring to design engines that maximize fuel efficiency while minimizing polluting byproducts of the combustion process. Fuel consumption has both a direct effect on the output of pollutants and the expense for the fuel used. Moreover, increasing the fuel efficiency of machinery using non-renewable resources, such as gasoline derived from oil, is an important social value. Minimizing pollutants minimizes the injurious effects on the environment and benefits the health of society on a global scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have been many attempts to attain efficiency increases while minimizing pollutants. The rotary engine is one example of such attempts. The principal characteristics of conventional rotary internal combustion engines are well known in the field of art. Generally, a rotary engine uses the pressure of combustion to move a triangular rotor within an epitrochoidal-shaped rotor housing. The four cycles of conventional combustion&mdash;intake, compression, combustion and exhaust&mdash;each take place in its own portion of the housing. These cycles cause the rotor to rotate an eccentric output shaft geared to the rotor. The rotary engine seemingly would have increased efficiency due to the decrease of moving parts, a combustion event of 270&deg; of the output shaft rotation on every rotation, and better balance, since the rotor and shaft move in the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Despite these advantages, the conventional rotary engine has found little commercial success because the long and shallow shape of the combustion chamber hurts both emissions and fuel economy performance with respect to conventional piston engines. The relatively brief time period of the power stroke of the piston on the power portion of the rotary motion does not allow for complete combustion of the fuel. This leads to the exhaust of unburned hydrocarbons that must be cleaned up by a catalytic converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Known rotary engines, though capable of producing relatively high power output for their weight and size, have generally been too complex and, in operation, have exhibited excessively high wear, short useful life and relatively high fuel consumption. In operation, they generally produce undesirably high nitric oxide and unburned or partially burned hydrocarbon outputs. All of these add to problems of air pollution. Thus, the efficiency and emissions goals are not satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another attempt to meet the efficiency and emissions goals is through the use of diesel cycle engines. The diesel cycle uses compression of a fuel and air mixture to ignite a combustion event, rather than a spark. This allows the diesel engine to utilize direct injection of the fuel and a higher compression ratio than ordinary gasoline. The higher compression ratio results in better efficiency than for ordinary gasoline engines. Moreover, diesel fuel has a higher energy density than gasoline. The combination of greater energy density and higher compression results in much-improved fuel efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, diesel cycle engines perform poorly in emissions performance. The combustion in a diesel engine produces significant amounts of polluting nitrogen oxides (NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>). This is especially true in large-scale uses, such as ship engines, or as power sources for electric generation plants. These NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>have been addressed primarily through the use of selective catalytic reduction of the nitrogen oxides. Catalytic converter use at large-scale diesel engines, such as ships and power plants, is not always feasible due to costs and space concerns. Therefore, elimination of the formation of NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>in the combustion chamber has been a focus of technological development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One measure to reduce NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>in diesel engines is through the injection of water into the combustion chamber to reduce the combustion temperature. The goal is to reduce the peak temperature arising at the flame, which results in a reduction in NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>formation. Forming fewer NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>equals fewer NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>emissions from the engine. Typically, the water is injected into the combustion chamber shortly before combustion, during combustion, or is mixed with the fuel before injection. A conventional four-stroke diesel engine usually injects the water towards the end of the compression stroke. The use of water injection on a piston-driven diesel engine addresses the emissions concerns to a certain degree. However, the use of a four-cycle reciprocating engine design still has the inherent efficiency drawbacks of producing only one 180&deg; power stroke for every other cycle of the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to design a diesel-fueled rotary engine. U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,021, to Loyd, discloses a rotary diesel engine. Said patent discusses the prior unsatisfactory attempts to utilize diesel fuel in rotary engines. The prior attempts produced unsatisfactory results due to the inability to create sufficient compression in the combustion chamber portion of the rotary housing. The Loyd patent addresses the compression problem by providing a precombustion chamber adjacent to the rotor housing and in communication with the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A fuel injector is disposed in the chamber for injecting fuel into the supplied combustion air. The combustion air is provided, in part, by a compressor, which ensures a sufficient pressure is maintained to combust the diesel fuel. The introduction of fuel into the precombustion chamber in the presence of high pressure and temperature causes the combustion of the fuel to flash into the working chamber of the housing via an outlet port. The burning continues in the working chamber to cause the rotor to rotate the output shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,813, to Louthan et al., discloses an alternate method of providing a precombustion chamber to a diesel fueled rotary engine without the need for a separate compressor. However, Louthan and Loyd do not address the emissions issues associated with triangular rotors or with the use of diesel fuel, as discussed previously. Therefore, there is a continuing need to provide an internal combustion engine with improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The positive displacement turbine solves many of the above-indicated problems of rotary engines by providing a rotary engine, which produces an exhaust low in air pollutants while operating efficiently and requiring minimal cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The positive displacement turbine generally comprises a separate compressor, combustion chamber and expansion chamber. The expansion chamber utilizes a crescent-shaped piston, a hub and a cam track in order to extract maximum energy from expanding combustion gases. The positive displacement turbine may also utilize an internal coolant injector system. The coolant injector system assists in cooling the positive displacement turbine, improves efficiency by water injection, and injects a chemical exhaust precipitator into the combustion chamber to react with and precipitate pollutants from the exhaust stream, leaving only carbon dioxide and a few inert gases to escape into the atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The positive displacement turbine is adaptable for use with many different fuels, including diesel fuel, gasoline and gaseous fuels including hydrogen. It is adaptable and scaleable for various-sized applications. The invention is also well-adapted to be manufactured from non-traditional engine materials such as composites and ceramics.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the positive displacement turbine (PDT) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, compressor section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and expansion section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed from a variety of materials, including conventional steel, cast iron or aluminum, as well as ceramics and composites. Constructing the PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of aluminum, steel, cast iron or a combination of these materials offers the opportunity for the PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be readily manufactured using presently available production facilities without the need for extensive retooling. However, non-metallic low thermal conductivity ceramics and carbon fiber composites may be preferable for construction of the PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Ceramics and carbon composites offer the advantages of being strong, lightweight and recyclable, as well as facilitating simple and inexpensive manufacturing of the PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A further advantage of the use of ceramics and carbon composites is that they will allow the manufacturing of a hermetically sealed engine unit. A hermetically sealed engine unit will prevent the end user from tampering with the tuning of the engine, thereby maintaining highly efficient operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Ceramics are commercially available for many providers, such as Dow-Corning and Champion Spark Plug, Ceramic Division. Carbon fiber composites and other composites are commercially available from DuPont. </paragraph>

Leading edge <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is adapted to follow closely and scour the inner surface of stator body <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, as piston hub <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> rotate about shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> within expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> defines a path of travel as illustrated in sequential sub <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>D. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the interaction of cam follower <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> with cam tracks <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, in combination with the interaction between piston body <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and saddle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, define the motion of crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. This relationship maximizes surface area for gases with an expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to push against. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Coolant injector <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is used to inject an injection fluid coolant into combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during the combustion process. Water injection is well known in the art and has been employed in reciprocating engines since the 1930s. The term &ldquo;injection fluid coolant&rdquo; is intended here to mean any non-fuel fluid introduced into the positive displacement turbine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> internal combustion engine. The injection fluid coolant is made, preferably, of water and a small amount of a chemical alkali; for example, calcium hydroxide or calcium phosphate. The concentration of the alkali component preferably corresponds to the amount of acidic combustion by products produced by the engine during the combustion process. Thus, sufficient base, such as calcium hydroxide, is mixed with the injector fluid to react with and neutralize the resulting acids formed in the combustion process. As is well known, the acid-base reaction yields water and a salt. The case of calcium hydroxide with sulfuric acid is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Ca(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><custom-character file="US20030000496A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/>CaSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.2H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In operation, compressed air is taken in and compressed by compressor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Compressed air is forced through compressor check valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the pressure has equalized between the outside of compressor check valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the inside of combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, compressor check valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> closes. After the closing of compressor check valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, fuel injector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> injects a metered quantity of fuel to mix with the compressed air already in combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Compression ignition then occurs to ignite the fuel-air mixture. Alternatively, a spark plug <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be provided to the combustion chamber to ignite the fuel-air, depending on the type of fuel used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously with combustion, coolant injector <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> injects a charge of coolant into combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Coolant may be injected at another point in time during the combustion cycle, such as prior to the introduction of the compressed air. Coolant is converted to steam with a consequent increase in combustion chamber pressure and reduction in temperature. The gas pressure created by the combustion process forces gas into and through combustion gas passages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and acts on valve piston <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. This opens PGSV <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Hot expanding combustion gases then cause PGSV <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to open, allowing the hot combustion gases, along with the gaseous coolant, to leave combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and expand into expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At this point in time, crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is located at the top dead-center position, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. The hot combustion gases pass over expansion chamber redirecting surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and then apply force to piston face contour <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The force applied causes piston hub <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to rotate in a clockwise direction, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B, 8C</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> absorbs energy from the hot combustion gases throughout substantially its entire rotation. The location of exhaust port <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> allows the piston to receive force from the hot combustion gases throughout an effective approximate 370&deg; of rotation. The 370&deg; includes a 330&deg; primary exhausting plus a secondary 40&deg; exhausting. Exhaust gas begins to leave expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at about 330&deg; of rotation and continues for about another 40&deg;. The expanding combustion gases are still applying force to arcuate face <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, while the next charge of combustion gas is beginning to apply force to piston face contour <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during the following cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> employs the back pressures of the previous combustion cycle to create a sealing force between events. The action of crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and leading edge <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, in addition to the aerodynamic shape of the piston, accomplishes this. The leading edge <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> of the crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> pushes against the previous cycle of gases to exhaust them from the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Sustained high operating temperatures within the positive displacement turbine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> promote a complete combustion reaction leaving few particulates. Hydrocarbon fuels reacting with oxygen in the air produce large quantities of water vapor or live steam as a product of the reaction. Additional steam is generated from the coolant injected in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a perimeter shape to accommodate the movements of the crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The perimeter of the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is a circle, flattened in one aspect. This shape may be referred to as a semi-oblate circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Expansion chamber redirecting surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is shaped to direct combustion gases at piston face contour <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and to create a turbulent, circular, centrifugal flow of combustion gases within expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Crescent piston <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes piston face contour <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which tends to redirect hot exhaust gases upward and outward, creating a cyclonic gas movement along outer diameter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of piston hub <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and then in a reverse direction along the interior of expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This cyclonic movement of rotating hot gases creates an extremely turbulent gas circulation. This encourages complete oxidation of all components of the fuel. A fundamental principal of the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is that the more turbulent the gases in the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the lower the exhaust gas temperature. The cyclonic movement of hot combustion gases also facilitates the chemical reactions between acidic components of the combustion process and the calcium hydroxide or other alkali in the injection cooling fluid, thus facilitating the pH neutralization of acid combustion products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Further, the expansion of injection fluid coolant into expansion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> tends to recover thermal energy that would otherwise be wasted through a cooling or exhaust system. Regulating of engine operating temperature may be achieved by monitoring the exhaust gas temperature and by using this data to meter the amount of injection fluid coolant injected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engine is configured to take advantage of the high temperatures developed in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to salvage excess thermal energy. Coolant introduced into combustion chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is converted into live steam, thereby transferring additional force to the drive shaft as useful work. This salvaging of excess thermal energy tends to reduce the need for external air-cooling fins or water jackets. The PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> regulates its operating temperature through the use of injector fluid coolant. It is expected that, for every gallon of petroleum utilized in the PDT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, one to six gallons of injector fuel coolant will be used to absorb excess thermal energy. Actual usage will depend upon engine load and conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of any of the essential attributes thereof. Therefore, the illustrated embodiments should be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing description to indicate the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
