<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for controlling the operation of a kimchi storage device, and more particularly, to a method for controlling an operation of a kimchi storage device that maintains a predetermined temperature range of a storage chamber by operating a compressor and a heater alternately in a preservation mode of the kimchi storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a general refrigerator, the inner temperature changes significantly when a door is opened and closed frequently. Thus, it is hard to keep the kimchi to the proper degree of ripeness. In order to solve such problems, a kimchi storage device has been developed, which can mature the kimchi properly so as to be agreeable to the taste or a change of seasons, and preserve the flavor of the kimchi for a long period of time at a proper temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the kimchi storage device ferments and stores the kimchi according to the personal taste by warming the kimchi to ferment and mature the kimchi properly, or by cooling the kimchi to keep the kimchi unripe for a long period of time. Accordingly, the kimchi storage device has a cooling apparatus and a heating apparatus, and in order to preserve the flavor and freshness of kimchi for a long period of time. The kimchi storage device ripens the kimchi accommodated in the inner casing thereof for a short time according to its taste by using the heating apparatus, and then keeps the temperature of the inner casing properly cooled by using the cooling apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the basic construction of a conventional kimchi storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in the figure, a cooling unit of the kimchi storage device is comprised of a compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for compressing refrigerant at a high temperature and a high pressure, a condenser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for liquefying the refrigerant by irradiating the heat in the refrigerant compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a dryer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for filtering foreign substances contained in the refrigerant from the condenser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a decompression device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for reducing the pressure of the refrigerant from the dryer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as to be vaporized easily, and an evaporator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> installed in a storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to cool the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by vaporizing the refrigerant decompressed at the low pressure by the decompression device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to absorb heat and cool the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the kimchi storage device has a selection key input unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for selecting the kind of kimchi, ripening period, ripening temperature, etc., a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> for sensing the temperature in the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, a control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for controlling the operation of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the input of the selection key input unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and a display unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for displaying the status of the control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The kimchi storage device also has a heating unit. The heating unit is comprised of a heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> mounted on the outside surface of the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which heats the kimchi and the like under the control of the control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The kimchi storage device having the above construction operates in such a manner that the control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> heats the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by supplying an electrical coil <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with electrical power to ripen the kimchi according to the kind of kimchi or the ripening temperature of the kimchi, and then turns the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on and off repeatedly to maintain a constant temperature in the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If the operation mode of the kimchi storage device is changed to a preservation mode after the kimchi has been ripened, the control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> operates the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> alternately to be in the temperature range to preserve the flavor and freshness of kimchi by maintaining the temperature in the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to a constant temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In other words, in order to maintain the temperature within the temperature range of &minus;1. to 1., the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is controlled to operate when the temperature of the evaporator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> drops below &minus;1., and the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is controlled to operate when the temperature of the evaporator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> becomes above 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, in such a conventional method for controlling an operation of a kimchi storage device, when conditions to operate the heater are met only in a certain circumstances, for example, when the overall system stops operating and then resumes the operation by a sudden power failure during the normal operation in the preservation mode, when the system becomes normal again after a breakdown in the system, or when the temperature of the storage chamber suddenly becomes low as the operation mode is changed to the preservation mode by selection, the heater begins to operate immediately to raise the temperature in the storage chamber, which may cause the deterioration of the flavor and freshness of kimchi. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been proposed to solve the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a method for controlling operation of a kimchi storage device, in which a compressor operates immediately if the condition to operate the compressor is met and a heater operates after a predetermined time delay if the condition to operate the heater is met, whereby the variation in the temperature of the storage chamber caused by the abrupt sensing of low temperature and the operation of the heater thereby can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a method for controlling an operation of a kimchi storage device that maintains a constant temperature range of a storage chamber by operating a compressor and a heater alternately in a preservation mode of the kimchi storage device, the method comprising the steps of: measuring a temperature in the storage chamber; determining whether the temperature in the storage chamber is within a temperature range to operate the compressor or within a temperature range to operate the heater; if the temperature in the storage chamber is within the temperature range to operate the compressor, then operating the compressor; delaying an operation of the heater for a predetermined time when the temperature in the storage chamber is within the temperature range to operate the heater; determining whether the temperature in the storage chamber comes within the temperature range to operate the compressor or within the temperature range to operate the heater; if the temperature in the storage chamber comes within the temperature range to operate the compressor, then clearing a delay time for operating the heater, and operating the compressor immediately; if the temperature in the storage chamber is within a range of temperature to operate the heater, then operating the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as the temperature of the storage chamber measured in the preservation mode is determined to meet the conditions to operate the compressor, the compressor begins to operate immediately. And, as the temperature is determined to meet the conditions to operate the heater, operation of the heater is delayed for a certain amount of time, while the temperature of the storage chamber is measured. Then, the heater begins to operate only when the condition to operate the heater is still maintained after the time delay, and the compressor begins to operate if the temperature is changed to the condition to operate the compressor.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention will hereinafter be described in more detail by the preferred embodiments of the invention. The present embodiment does not limit the scope of the present invention, but it is only the example of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating the method for controlling the operation of the kimchi storage device according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The control method of the present invention is illustrated with reference to the general kimchi storage device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is has been illustrated as the conventional art of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the control method of the compressor and the heater according to the present invention is illustrated only in the case that the kimchi storage device operates in the preservation mode among various operation modes of the kimchi storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> At first, the temperature of the inner chamber of the storage chamber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the preservation mode is measured (S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). Then, the measured temperature of the storage chamber is determined (S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). At this time, if the measured temperature meets the condition to operate the compressor (S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>), the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> immediately lowers the temperature of the inner chamber (S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, if the measured temperature meets the condition to operate the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>(S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), operation of the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is delayed for a certain amount of time, in order to determine whether the temperature of the storage chamber has become low for a certain reason that, for example, the overall system stops operating and then resumes the operation by a sudden power failure during the normal operation in the preservation mode, the system becomes normal again after a breakdown in the system, or the temperature of the storage chamber suddenly drops as the operation mode is changed to the preservation mode by the change of the selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the beginning of the operation of the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is delayed, the measured temperature of the storage chamber is compared with the condition needed to operate the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>). If the measured temperature meets the condition to operate the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the delayed time is cleared (S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), and then the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operated immediately (S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> However, if the predetermined time to be delayed has passed while the measured temperature is maintained to the temperature meeting the condition to operate the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then operated to raise the temperature of the storage chamber (S<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In such a situation, the delay time is preferably set to one hundred minutes so that the heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> begins to operate if the temperature of the storage chamber is maintained low without any operation of loads after one hundred minutes. Then, the variation in temperature, which may be caused by the malfunction of the sensor or the operation of loads, can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the compressor operates immediately if the condition to operate the compressor is met and the heater operates after a predetermined time delay if the condition for operating the heater is met, whereby the variation in temperature of a storage chamber caused by the sudden change in temperature and the operation of the heater thereby can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the deterioration of flavor and freshness of kimchi, which may be caused by the variation of the temperature in the storage chamber when the heater is operated by the malfunction of the kimchi storage device, can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention should not be limited to within the spirit and the scope of the present invention.
