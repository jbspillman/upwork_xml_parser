<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a plug connector for an optical waveguide, which has a sheathed, light-conducting core and an outer cladding which surrounds the core sheathing, having a plug part, which can be plugged together with a mating plug part, the plug part forming a tube for insertion of the core, which can be severed flush with the tube end, and the mating plug part forming a shaft for insertion of the tube, which shaft at the foot side is directed toward a transmitting/receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A plug connector of this type forms part of the prior art. However, the known plug connector is not waterproof. To make a plug connector of this type watertight, DE 100 09 845, which is not a prior publication, proposes fitting an O-ring seal inside the plug part, which is to fit in a sealing manner around the core sheathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the object of making the plug connector which is known from the prior art watertight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The object is achieved by the invention described in the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> claim 1 provides first of all and in particular that the plug part is of two-part configuration, having a retaining part, which includes the tube and holding means for the core sheathing and also the outer cladding, and a cap part, which can be connected in a watertight manner to the retaining part and has a passage opening for the optical waveguide. This configuration results in a plug part which is easy to produce and simple to connect to the optical waveguide. In a preferred refinement of the invention, it is provided that the holding means are threaded sections for the core sheathing and the outer cladding to be screwed into. To secure the optical waveguide to the plug part, it is necessary to uncover the optical waveguide or the core sheathing in certain regions. Then, after the cap part has been pushed over the optical waveguide, that section of the optical waveguide from which the insulation has been removed in this manner is plugged into the rear opening in the plug part until the end edge of the core sheathing or the end edge of the outer cladding comes into contact with the threaded section. Relative rotation of the plug part with respect to the optical waveguide then causes those sections of core sheathing and of the outer cladding from which the insulation has been removed to be screwed into the associated internal screw thread of the plug part. In a preferred configuration, although the threaded sections inside the cavity of the plug part have different diameters, they have the same thread pitch. The result of this is that the core sheathing and the outer cladding can be screwed simultaneously into the associated screw threads. The threaded section which holds the core sheathing can be seated directly to the rear of the tube. In a preferred refinement, it is provided that the at least one section of the threaded section which holds the core sheathing is associated with a flange having a funnel-shaped opening. This flange projects above the base of the cavity which is associated with the threaded section holding the outer cladding. This cavity has a rear end, into which the optical waveguide can be slugged and which is in the form of an inner-cone section. The cap part which closes off this opening can be clipped to the retaining part. The tube into which the optical waveguide is plugged is surrounded by a tube projection which has an outwardly facing annular bead. This tube projection is plugged into an annular slot in the mating plug part. The annular slot surrounds a core which is formed by a pedestal which forms the shaft into which the tube is plugged. The radially outer boundary of this annular slot is formed by a snap-action rim which engages over the bead in a watertight manner. The snap-action rim itself is formed by a soft plastic sleeve which is integrated in a watertight manner in the mating plug part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to the plug part of the plug connector.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is made from a material which conducts light waves. The core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may consist of plastics. The core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is surrounded by tension-relieving fibers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> surrounds the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The plug part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is of two-part form. It comprises only a retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cap part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which closes off the rear opening of the retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cap part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed as injection moldings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the plug-in side, the retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in which the core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> lies, so that its end projects beyond the tube end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. It can then be cut off flush with the tube end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which comes out of the front end face of the retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is coaxially surrounded by a tube projection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This tube projection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is joined integrally in terms of materials to the tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, has an outwardly projecting bead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> At its end, the tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> widens toward the plug interior to form an internal screw thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, into which the core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be screwed. The internal screw thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in certain regions associated with a flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which originates from the base of the inner cavity of the retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. To facilitate introduction of the core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the screw thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the threaded section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opens out in the shape of a funnel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The cavity has a second screw thread <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of larger diameter. This threaded section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is used for the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, around which the tension-relief fibers have been laid toward the rear, to be screwed into it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To make it easier to introduce the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the opening of the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a conical rim section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In the region of the conical rim section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the retaining part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> forms an annular bead which projects radially outward and over which a snap-action rim of the cap part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be clipped. The cap part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has inner sealing lips <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which bear in a sealing manner against the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The cap part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> closes off the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a watertight manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is plugged into the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a pedestal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the mating plug part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The tube end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the process comes to bear in contact or almost in contact with a transmitting/receiving element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is associated with the base of the shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the plug part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is plugged into the mating plug part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the tube projection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes into the annular slot between pedestal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and snap-action rim <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, so that the snap-action rim <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can engage over the radially outwardly projecting bead <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the tube projection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a watertight manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The plug part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is assembled as a result of, first of all, the cap part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> being pushed over the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are uncovered in steps. The tension relief fibers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are placed over the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> toward the rear. Then, that end of the optical waveguide from which the insulation has been removed is plugged into the cavity <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the process, the core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> slides into the tube <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Relative rotation of the plug part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with respect to the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> causes the core sheathing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be screwed into the internal screw thread <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, causes the outer cladding <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be screwed into the internally threaded section <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> until the end of the core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> projects beyond the tube end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Then, the cap part is pushed over the bead of the retaining part <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the projecting end of the core <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut off flush with the tube end <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
