<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A paint injector for digital printing in which paint is deposited in metered amounts on a print medium comprises a wheel rotatable by a shaft of a motor, an idler disposed in a paint reservoir, and an endless cable disposed around the wheel and the idler. The motor is preferably computer controlled such that the rotation of the wheel and thus movement of the cable is selectively controlled. As the wheel is rotated, paint contained within the paint reservoir coats the cable and is thus drawn by the cable in front of an air stream. The air stream pulls the paint from the cable and carries it toward the print medium. By employing a plurality of such paint injectors into a single print head, each containing a different color of paint, and secured to a computer controlled, movable carriage positioned over the print medium, a digital image can be painted by the print head on the print medium. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to an apparatus used for digital painting and, more specifically, to an apparatus that employs a metering device for metering a quantity of paint to be deposited on a surface to be painted and that deposits the metered quantity of paint on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As computer technology has advanced, the ability to view high resolution graphics has improved and the resolution and speed capabilities of color printers have increased to enable reproduction of photorealistic images. One of the more significant and lucrative printer technologies to be developed in recent years is the ink jet printer that mixes several colors, typically cyan, magenta, yellow and black, on the paper to form a color image. Conventional ink jet printing heads include a plurality of nozzles and thermal elements. Ink is expelled from the nozzles in a jet by bubble pressure created by heating the ink by the thermal elements while the nozzles and thermal elements are in close proximity. One such ink jet printing head, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,143 to Hayamizu, includes a thermal head member having at least one thermal element consisting of a plurality of thermal dot elements and a plurality of electrodes of different widths connected to each thermal element whereby different widths of heated portions of the thermal element are obtainable to vary the amount of ink jetted in one dot. Another such ink jet printing head is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,621 to Hayamizu et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another type of print head is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,780 to Yamamori et al. in which an ink ejection recording apparatus includes a plurality of ink ejection heads connected to an ink tank, each of the ink ejection heads having an ink nozzle through which minute ink droplets are discharged in accordance with an electric signal and an air nozzle opposing the ink nozzle and adapted for forming an air stream which accelerates the ink droplets toward a recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typical desk top ink jet printers for home or office use are relatively inexpensive but are usually limited to printing on standard office size sheets of paper, such as 8&frac12;&times;11 or similar standard sizes. Printers that can accommodate larger formats such as poster-sized sheets, however, are currently thousands of dollars to purchase and machines that can print billboard-sized sheets are typically tens of thousands of dollars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some wide format printers are able to accommodate 16 feet or wider substrates such as films, paper, vinyl, and the like and can print 300 ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per hour, depending on the resolution of the print. Such machines sometimes employ piezo printhead technology that employs several printheads per color with numerous nozzles per printhead to deposit ink onto the print medium. Another approach is to employ air brush technology in which inks are metered by valves and/or pumps and deposited onto the substrate. The quantity of ink pumped for each color and the position at which it is deposited on the print medium is typically computer controlled. The print medium is typically provided on a roll in which unmarked medium is fed under the print head and printed medium is re-rolled once the ink has had sufficient time to dry. Large format printers using air brush technology typically have a resolution of up to approximately 70 dpi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to the cost of the machine itself, which employs relatively small orifices, valves and nozzles for depositing the desired quantity and color of ink on the print medium (e.g., paper), very fine grade inks are used in which particle sizes within the inks are kept to a minimum to help keep the orifices, valves, and nozzles of the ink system from becoming clogged. Such inks are expensive and are not very cost effective for painting billboard sized prints. Despite the high quality and expense of ink products, clogging of the printhead is still a problem in current printer technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Many large format printers also use water-based inks that may not be suitable for outdoor use. Accordingly, special waterproofing systems and techniques must be employed such as treating the printing medium with a substance that binds with the ink once deposited to form a waterproof mark or laminating the print with a weatherproof film. These weatherproofing techniques and processes add expense to the cost of each print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a paint injector or print head that does not include orifices and/or nozzles through which the ink or paint must flow and, thus, is not limited by paint particle size or large particle contamination and is relatively insensitive to the physical properties of the paint. It would also be advantageous to provide a device that can use paints and inks already designed for the sign and art industries and that can be employed to digitally print on large format media. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a paint injector that can print with many forms of liquid printing materials such as paints and inks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a paint injector that is relatively simple in construction and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a paint injector in which the liquid printing material is metered through computer control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a plurality of paint injectors in a print head, each paint injector containing a different color, and employing the print head to create a digital image on a print medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a paint injector is provided comprising an air nozzle that directs a jet of air across a moving member, the member having ink, paint, or other similarly pigmented liquid material disposed thereon. The air jet pulls the paint off of the member and onto a print medium, such as paper, vinyl, film, or other print media known in the art. Preferably, the segment is a continuous loop of material that is sequentially moved in front of the air jet by at least one wheel around which the loop is disposed. Thus, as the loop is advanced in front of the air jet, paint thereon is blown off of the loop and onto the print medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a miniature wire cable is employed to bring ink or paint contained within a reservoir in proximity with an air stream where it is carried to a print medium. A microprocessor or other controlling device controls the cable so that the speed of the cable&apos;s advance through the air stream meters the quantity of paint injected into the air stream. As the cable is advanced through the reservoir, a coating of paint clings to the cable, the thickness of the coating being controlled to a degree by the viscosity of the paint. In addition, a mechanical metering device, such as a scraper riding proximate to or in contact with the cable as it is advanced, may be employed to control the thickness of paint on the cable before it enters the air stream. The cable, having a coating of paint thereon, is then drawn into close proximity to one or more jets of air. As the paint on the cable reaches the jet of air it is pulled or blown off the cable into the air stream until it impacts the print medium. In order to keep the cable positioned in front of the air stream, a cable guide may be employed proximate to the air nozzle to prevent the cable from being forced away from the air stream and to reduce vibration of the cable in the air stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The cable is preferably drawn through the paint reservoir and thus coated with paint by being disposed around a pulley or wheel driven by a motor and around an idler or guide that is at least partially immersed in paint. A controller, such as microprocessor or other computing device, controls the advance of the motor and thus movement of the cable. In addition, the controller can control movement of the paint injector as it is swept across a print medium. By utilizing a plurality of paint injectors in a print head, each containing a different color of paint, and by controlling and coordinating the metering of the paint and the position of the print head, a digital image can be created on the print medium.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a preferred embodiment of a single color paint injector, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, according to the present invention for depositing paint, ink, dye, or other liquified pigmented material that could be used for painting or printing onto a substrate comprising a frame or plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to which a motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached. The motor may be a stepper motor, a DC motor, or other device known in the art in which rotational advancement can be selectively controlled. A pulley or wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a circumscribing groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> defined therein is secured to the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An elongate frame member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> depends from and is secured to the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extends into a container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A rotatable or stationary idler or guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attached to the distal end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the elongate frame member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The idler or guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may comprise a rotatable wheel or pulley but, as illustrated, may be a cylindrical, non-rotatable member having a groove <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> circumscribing the guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in which a structure or an elongate segment of material, in this example an endless miniature wire cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, can slide upon rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is also contemplated that the segment of material could be comprised of a wire hoop, a band, a ribbon, or a relatively thin structure having material windable from a freely rotatable idler, spool or wheel onto a drive spool or wheel, or any other structure upon which liquified pigmented material could be applied. Preferably, the miniature wire cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is comprised of a plurality of small wires (e.g., three, four, or seven) each having a diameter of between approximately 0.001 and 0.004 inches for example, and may be formed from a single wire spirally wrapped upon itself into the desired overall endless loop diameter. Thus, the wire would spiral around the endless loop a desired number of times (e.g., seven) with the ends of the wire woven into the center of the cable, trimmed flush, and, if desired, welded, as by laser welding, within the cable. Preferably, the overall cable cross-section diameter is approximately 0.012 inches. It is also preferable that the cable be coated with a flexible polyurethane or other similar plastic coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is disposed in the groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> circumscribing the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and in the groove <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> circumscribing the guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The cable may be comprised of a metal material such as stainless steel, spring metal, nickel/titanium alloy, and/or other metals and alloys or of such materials as kevlar, graphite, nylon or other materials that have a substantially high tensile strength. Preferably, the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is wrapped 1.5 or more times around the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and approximately 0.5 times around the guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Wrapping the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in such a manner around the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provides sufficient friction between the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will not slip relative to the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When mounting the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> onto the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is preferably that the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> be placed in the groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the end of the wire (as previously discussed) forming the last loop of the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not &ldquo;peeled back&rdquo; as it rotates around the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be snagged by the top wrap of the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Tension in the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is maintained in a desired range by adjusting the guide <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Such tension, however, may be quite minimal as the stiffness and spring-like properties of the material from which the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed helps to maintain tension in the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and its position relative to the rest of the paint injector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A biased second wheel or pulley around which the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is disposed may also be employed to provide adequate tension in the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An elongate reservoir retaining member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and includes a flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> depending therefrom defining a notch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the elongate reservoir retaining member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receiving a top lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the paint reservoir or container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A bottom plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is secured to the distal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the elongate reservoir retaining member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a threaded nut <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> threaded onto a threaded shaft <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The threaded shaft <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is secured to the distal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the elongate reservoir retaining member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> abuts against the bottom <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and holds the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> relative to the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the flange <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bottom plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Other configurations of reservoirs and containers and means of attaching such containers relative to the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are also contemplated without departing from the spirit of the present invention. In addition, it is also contemplated that a reservoir may not be required if the pigmented material being deposited is dribbled or otherwise applied, as by wiping across a paint soaked pad, to the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An air supply hose <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is secured to a nozzle body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and supplies air through a nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is aimed at the segment or the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> passing thereby. A cable guide <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> defining a longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned proximate the nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> rides within the slot <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is thus held in relative position to the nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so that air passing therethrough does not substantially move the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from in front of the nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or cause the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to substantially vibrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In operation, paint or other pigmented liquid material contained in the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is picked up by the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and advanced by rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, indicated by the arrow, in front of the nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In order to help control the speed of rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a series of gears, wheels, belts, or combinations thereof may be employed between the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Air being blown through the nozzle orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> disperses or pulls paint from the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> toward the painting surface. Depending on the viscosity of the paint, the cross-sectional diameter of the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the diameter of the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> formed by the groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a relatively precise amount of paint can be effectively metered by advancing the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thus rotating the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> a relatively precise fraction of a rotation. Such an apparatus may produce images having a resolution of approximately 50 dpi or better, which is more than adequate for large signs such as billboards and the like. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> mechanical metering device such as scraper <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be secured to the top lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The scraper <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may define a slot <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> therein for receiving the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and thus removing, by wiping or scraping, paint from the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> upon advancement of the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through the slot <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The force of the air stream upon the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> removes the paint in such a manner as to produce a relatively clean cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for engagement with the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can rotate about the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> without the groove <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> becoming obstructed with paint. While an air stream has been described as the preferred vehicle for transporting the paint from the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a print medium, it is also contemplated that other fluid streams, such as thinner or other materials known in the art, may be employed or mixed with air or another gas to transport the paint from the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a print medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is controlled by a controller, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, comprising circuitry <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in a module <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that receives signals from a signal generating device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such as a personal computer employing a microprocessor or other devices that can supply discrete signals to instruct selective rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the motor. The circuitry <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> receives a signal(s) from the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and rotates the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the motor according to the signal(s). Those skilled in the art will recognize that such circuitry <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> could be incorporated into the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or that the components of the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> could be incorporated into the module <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In the case where the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a stepper motor, the signal(s) is sent in the form of an electrical pulse(s), each pulse designating a single step that the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to be rotated. A typical stepper motor provides 200 steps per revolution with each step being activated by a voltage in the range of 0.2 to 5 volts, depending on the voltage requirement of the motor. Thus, if it is desired to deposit the quantity of paint drawn by the cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in one half of a revolution of the wheel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, 100 pulses would be sent by the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the circuitry <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> would convert each pulse into a voltage depending on the voltage requirement of the stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sufficient to cause the stepper motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to rotate its shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> one step, and the shaft would rotate 100 steps. A power supply line <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be provided to the module <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to provide the requisite voltage to turn the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A preferred way of driving the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to perform all shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> advances for the paint injector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by time calculations made by the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereby eliminating the need of a calculating device within the paint injector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself. Thus, all cable <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> advances for the same color of paint, in addition to spatial motions of the paint injector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the print medium for depositing the metered paint at relatively precise locations, can be made by the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> driving logic lines connected to the module <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> driving the motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If a DC servo motor is employed, the signal sent from the device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> would be converted into a voltage by the module <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> necessary to rotate the shaft of the DC motor a desired portion of a rotation, and a feedback device, such as an optical encoder, would be employed by the circuitry <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to control the precise rotation. It is also contemplated that a crude metering of paint could be accomplished by simply providing a timed duration of power to a motor without feedback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another preferred embodiment of a paint injector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The paint injector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that defines a pair of nozzle ports or orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are oriented and positioned relative to a cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so that one orifice <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is positioned on one side of the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the other orifice <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is positioned on the other side of the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> first wheel <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to a shaft <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of a motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with a set screw <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In addition, the motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is bolted to a plate <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with bolts such as bolts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Likewise, bolts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> attach a reservoir retaining member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to the plate <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. An air supply line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has a threaded coupling device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> attached to an end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> thereof and attaches the supply line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to an externally threaded connector (not shown) on the nozzle body <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The nozzle body <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is secured to the plate <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by bolt <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and an elongate member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that supports a guide <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is secured to the plate <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by a set screw <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The nozzle body <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is shown in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and includes an air supply connector <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and two orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that produce low pressure zones <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on both sides of the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and thus draw the paint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> into the air stream <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The low pressure zones <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> also help keep the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> centrally located between the two orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by providing substantially equal pressure on both sides of the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> each have a diameter of approximately 0.014 inches and a length of 0.050 inches. While one and two nozzle configurations have been illustrated, various other nozzle configurations may be equally effective for removing the paint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> while reducing spray or divergence of the paint within the air stream <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and are thus contemplated within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Spatter created by the paint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> impacting the print medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and by turbulent flow of air around the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be controlled by controlling the pressure of air supplied to the orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and thus the velocity of the air stream <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. For orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as described, an air pressure of approximately 10 psi would be sufficient to direct the paint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> toward the print medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and substantially clean the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> while minimizing spatter. Higher pressures of 80 psi or more may have equal utility depending on the distance of the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from the paint medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, the quantity of paint <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the cable <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and the diameter of the orifices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While, as previously discussed, a continuous cable of material may be employed to meter the paint, it is equally plausible that other moving devices could be included to provide the same metering effect. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> paint extracting device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a paint injector <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be comprised of an elongate rod <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attached to structure, generally indicated by dashed line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, such as a solenoid or other mechanical device such as that found in a typical sewing machine, for moving the elongate rod <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrow into and out of the paint <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> contained in a reservoir <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and in front of the nozzle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. To meter the paint <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> deposited by the air stream <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the movement of the rod <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such as the number of strokes into the paint <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, may be controlled by a controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in a similar manner as previously described with reference to the other preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> digital printing device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> employing a plurality of paint injectors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, such as the paint injectors herein described, attached to a moveable carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Each paint injector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contains a different color of paint comprising a multi-color print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. For example, paint injector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may contain yellow, paint injector <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may contain magenta, paint injector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may contain cyan, paint injector <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may contain black, and paint injector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may contain white. Because the print medium is typically white, white paint is not used as a standard color in conventional printheads. Standard process colors include yellow, magenta, cyan, and black. Having white painted added to the mix of colors, however, allows a graphics artist to manually add detail to a wet print without &ldquo;mudding&rdquo; the colors or the image. It is also contemplated that more or fewer paint injectors may be included with various colors contained therein depending on the desired colors of print produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To selectively move the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in an x-direction, the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is mounted on a pair of shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, preferably <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inch round shafts, with linear bearings <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> that allow the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to slide along the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A motor <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, such as a stepper motor, controlled by x-drive electronics <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and having a sprocket <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> attached to the shaft <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> thereof is employed to move the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> along the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The sprocket <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with freely rotatable sprockets or idlers <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, engages with the drive chain <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (shown in dashed lines) to move the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> along the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The drive chain <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as well as the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are fixed between a left support assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and a right support assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. It is also contemplated that the motor <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> be mounted on either the left assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> or right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> or some other structure to lower the mass of the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Such a motor would then drive a moveable chain or belt to position the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> at the desired location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To selectively move the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in a z-direction, the entire printing device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is mounted to an overhead structure such as a ceiling <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> with bracket assemblies <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The left bracket assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> supports a pair of left z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (only the closest of which is visible) and the right bracket assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> supports a pair of right z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (only the closest of which is visible). A freely rotatable sprocket <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is mounted to the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and engages one of the right z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Similarly, on the opposite side of the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, another freely rotatable sprocket mounted to the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> engages the other of the z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a freely rotatable sprocket <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is mounted to the left assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and engages one of the left z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and another freely rotatable sprocket on the opposite side of the left assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> engages the other of the left z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Both the left z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the right z-drive roller chains <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> engage with z-drive sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (four in all, only the closest of which is visible) and have weights <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, (four in all, only the closest of which is visible) suspended from their distal ends <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, respectively, to keep the chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> taut around the sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Similar to the x-drive assembly, the sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are driven by a motor <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, such as a stepper motor, that engages with a worm gear unit <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> as is known in the art to transfer rotational movement of the motor <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to the sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and thus move the left and right assemblies <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and thus the carriage <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in a z-direction. Chain guards, such as chain guard <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, may be utilized near the sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to maintain engagement of the chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> with the sprockets <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to keep the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> from swaying either away from a print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> or from side to side, a track <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> may be vertically oriented and secured to the structure <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, such as a wall or frame, to which the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> is temporarily secured. As shown in DETAIL A, the track <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> has a J-shaped cross-section into which a guide member <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> can engage and slide therethrough. In this preferred embodiment, the guide member <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is comprised of a threaded bolt having its head <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> retained by the track <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and its shaft <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> secured to the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, movement of the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is restricted from moving away from the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> or toward the left assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a second track <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, having an opposite orientation to the track <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, is secured to the structure <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> to restrict movement of the left assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> from moving away from the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> or toward the right assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other track and guide member assemblies could be employed to maintain the printing device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in position relative to the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, such as a single C-shaped track and retaining member arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In operation, the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> is positioned in front of the digital painting device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, such as a computer, sends signals to the painting device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to direct movement of the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and dispersion of paint from the paint injectors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to form an image on the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. More specifically, signals from the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are sent to the z-drive electronics <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> which in turn convert the signals into movement of the sprocket <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> along the chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> corresponding to the desired z-direction position of the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Likewise, signals from the controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are sent to the x-drive electronics <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> corresponding to the desired x-direction position of the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> along the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> also individually controls each of the paint injectors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to deposit the desired color of paint on the print medium <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> at the desired location. Thus, the printable image size of the printing device <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is only limited by the length of the chains <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the length of the shafts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention also contemplates that the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, or individual paint injectors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> could be employed with other digital printing devices known in the art for digital painting purposes. For example, the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> could be employed in a device where movement of the print head is along an x-axis while a roll of print medium, such as vinyl, is selectively advanced relative to the print head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to affect movement along the y- or z-axis. With such a device, the size of print medium may only be limited by the size of the roll of print medium. Likewise, a rigid frame to which the print head, according to the present invention, can be mounted and upon which the print head could be selectively moved could also be employed to allow z- and x-direction movement or x- and y-direction movement of the print head, depending on the orientation of the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In general, the invention comprises digitally controlling the immersion of an extracting device into paint and the advancement of the once immersed and now coated extracting device in front of a stream of air to remove the paint from the extracting device and deposit it onto a print medium. It is noted that while references are made to paint in the specification and claims, the term is intended to encompass, inks, dyes, and any other liquid pigmented material that can be deposited on a surface for printing or painting purposes. In addition, it is to be understood that the above-described embodiments are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and alternatives may be devised by those skilled in the art, including combinations of the various embodiments, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The appended claims are intended to cover such modifications, alternative arrangements, and combinations. </paragraph>
