<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Variations in electrical impedance of the human tissue may be indicative of tumors, lesions and other anomalies. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,708 to Frei, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,694, and the article, &ldquo;Breast Cancer Screening by Impedance Measurements,&rdquo; by G. Pipemo et al., Frontiers Med. Biol. Eng., Vol. 2 pp. 111-117, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe systems for determining the impedance between a point on the surface of the skin and some reference point on the body of the patient. With the use of a multi-element probe, a two-dimensional impedance map of an organ such as a breast can be generated. The impedance map, describing variations in impedance along the tissue of the organ, can be used for the detection of tumors and especially malignant tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One of the factors which influences the chances of curing a patient having a malignant tumor is early detection of the tumor. Therefore, although many tumors are detectable using prior art impedance imaging systems, it is continuously desired to improve the resolution of these systems to allow earlier detection of anomalies which may be malignant tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,708 to Frei, mentioned above, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,742 to Pearlman the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe methods of impedance imaging of an organ. A multi-element probe is placed on a surface of the organ and a reference signal is applied to the human body including the organ at a reference point far from the imaged organ. The resolution of the system depends on the resolution of a sensor of the probe and/or on the signal strength of the reference signal. When a digital sensor is used, increasing the resolution may be achieved by performing analog to digital conversion over the entire dynamic range. This, however, increases the cost and power consumption of the probe. Increasing the signal strength of the reference signal is not desirable for reasons of safety, patient discomfort and power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The blood volume of organs of the human body changes with the cardiac cycle (heart cycle) of the human. The detection of the changes in the blood volume is referred to as plethysmography. Plethysmography is commonly used to determine the phase of the cardiac cycle, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,672, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and in pulse oximeters which measure blood oxygen saturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> UK patent application GB 2,138,148, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, states that impedance changes which are correlated with the cardiac, respiratory or other functions of the body, may be recorded, for example, for an evaluation of the stroke-volume of the heart and respiration and perfusion of the lungs. An article titled &ldquo;In Vivo Imaging of Cardiac Related Impedance Changes&rdquo;, B. Murat et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, states that it has been shown that the thoracic resistance variations during the cardiac cycle can be imaged by ECG-gated electrical impedance tomography (EIT). This article describes using EIT to image the blood flow to the lungs to detect abnormalities in pulmonary perfusion, such as pulmonary embolism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,010 to Anbar, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a method of cancer detection based on temporal periodic changes. The temporal periodic changes are suggested to be detected based on dynamic area thermometry (DAT), infrared sensing, MRI, or ultrasound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Web pages available on May, 1, 2001 at www.dobimedical.com, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a breast cancer detection system which measures transmission of red light through the breast. The system records the transient response to a pressure stimulus that initiates changes in blood volume and hemoglobin oxygenation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to detecting, locating and/or analyzing anomalies based on impedance signals which are indicative of changes in the blood volume and/or of the blood flow through an examined body region of a subject. In some embodiments of the invention, the amplitude of the change in the blood volume signals and/or the amplitude of the blood flow signals are used to aid in anomaly detection, location and/or analysis. Anomalies generally have different blood volume than normal tissue. Therefore, the amplitude of signals representing the blood volume, the blood flow and/or the changes in the blood volume and/or blood flow through an examined region are indicative of whether an anomaly is located within the examined region, the depth of the anomaly within the region and/or the type of the anomaly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic side view of an imaging procedure of a breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a subject, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which includes a plurality of conductive sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is placed against a surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the invention, an electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides electrical excitation to breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is placed against a surface of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> opposite surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on which probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed, with a predetermined voltage signal applied thereto. In some embodiments, electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has substantially the same surface area as probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises an acquisition unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which amplifies and digitizes the signals from sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using methods known in the art. In some embodiments of the invention, acquisition unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes one or more A/D converters <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which translate the signals sensed by sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to digital samples. Processing circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, included in probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, analyzes the digital samples and forms an impedance map of a region <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> beneath surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively to using electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in some embodiments of the invention, alternative or additional excitation electrodes are used in exciting breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Excitation may be applied from a remote location on the subject, far from breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or from one or more surfaces of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The excitation may be applied as voltage and/or current signals in one or more frequencies and/or as DC signals. </paragraph>

Acquisition unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> optionally includes low noise amplifiers in order to minimize the noise included in the sensed samples. Alternatively or additionally, the excitation power of the signals applied to electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is between about 100-500 &mgr;A/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, so as to allow detection of signals with relatively small amplitudes. Alternatively, any other excitation power levels are used, for example lower levels of between about 10-100 &mgr;A/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises an 8&times;8 array of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, although any other arrangement and/or number of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be used. In some embodiments of the invention, each sensing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a separate respective A/D, allowing concurrent sensing of signals by all of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a single A/D converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used for each group of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., for each column or row of probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or for all of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, each time a sample is to be taken, acquisition unit <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> sweeps through all of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> taking a measurement from each of the sensing elements using the same A/D converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is as flowchart of the actions performed during an impedance imaging procedure, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. An electrical excitation signal at a suitable frequency is applied (<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) to electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the electrical excitation has a frequency of between about 0.1-5 MHz. Alternatively or additionally, higher or lower frequencies, for example of the order of a few kHz are used. Further alternatively or additionally, DC signals are used. In some embodiments of the invention, different frequencies are used for different procedures, i.e., detection of anomalies, location of anomalies and/or analysis of anomalies and/or for different body regions. Alternatively or additionally, an inspection procedure is repeated with a plurality of different frequencies, so as to provide more reliable results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> senses (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>) a series of measurements of the peak to peak amplitude of the currents which reach the element. In some embodiments of the invention, the sensed series of measurements includes a plurality of samples taken over a period which includes at least one cardiac cycle of the subject. The series of samples covers, in some embodiments, a plurality of cardiac cycles of the subject, within each of which cycles a plurality of samples are taken. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the sampling period is between about 5-10 seconds and includes between about 25-125 samples, equally or unequally distributed. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, taking a single sample by a single sensing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> requires between about 10-100 microseconds, and samples are taken for substantially all of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> about every 0.1 seconds. Thus, in some embodiments, a single A/D converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may service over 100 sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Processing circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives the series of samples and determines (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) from the series of samples, a waveform of the changes in the samples. In some embodiments of the invention, the waveform of the changes in the samples is filtered (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) to remove changes which are due to noise (e.g., motion artifacts) and/or to extract signals which follow a separate signal of the subject (e.g., the cardiac cycle of the subject). In some embodiments of the invention, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> determines (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) the amplitude of the filtered waveform of the changes (referred to in the following as the pulsatile amplitude) and displays (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) a surface map of region <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which indicates (e.g., using colors, contours) the pulsatile amplitude of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In a healthy breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the surface map should conform to a predetermined distribution of the values of the pulsatile amplitude throughout region <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which distribution is representative of healthy breasts. Certain anomalies, however, have significantly different blood volume than the surrounding healthy tissue of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and therefore will appear differently on the displayed map. In some embodiments of the invention, only areas which have abnormal pulsatile amplitude values, are displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally to displaying a map of the pulsatile amplitude values, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> performs an automatic comparison between the pulsatile amplitude values from different sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and accordingly provides locations of suspected anomalies, the depth of a suspected anomaly beneath surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and/or a value indicative of the type of the anomaly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> compares the absolute determined pulsatile amplitude to predetermined known values for various types of tissues. The predetermined known values may depend on the distance between electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or on other measurement related parameters. In an embodiment of the invention, the distance between electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or the other measurement related parameters are entered (automatically or by a human operator based on measurements from separate apparatus) to circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such that the circuitry selects the correct predetermined known values of the specific procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> compares the difference between the pulsatile amplitude of a suspected anomaly and the pulsatile amplitude of surrounding tissue, to predetermined known values of pulsatile amplitude differences. For example, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may indicate areas in which there is a sharp difference (above a predetermined level) between the pulsatile amplitudes of adjacent sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is used to aid in anomaly detection, localization and/or analysis. Generally, cancerous anomalies have a larger blood volume than surrounding tissue, as cancerous anomalies generally include more blood vessels. Therefore, the changes during the cardiac cycle in the blood volume of a cancerous anomaly are larger than in normal tissue and the pulsatile amplitude is larger. Non-malignant anomalies, such as cysts, generally have a lower pulsatile amplitude than the surrounding tissue, due to their greater liquid content which does not include blood vessels. Thus, the use of the change waveform provides a better contrast between anomalies and their surrounding and/or between different types of anomalies, allowing detection and analysis of smaller anomalies than provided for by the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The area over which the pulsatile amplitude is influenced by the anomaly generally depends on the depth of the anomaly within breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The area generally increases with the distance of the anomaly from probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition, the pulsatile amplitude is generally a function of the depth and/or size of the anomaly. In some embodiments of the invention, after the depth and/or size of an anomaly are determined using any method described herein and/or otherwise known in the art, the pulsatile amplitude is normalized based on the depth and/or size of the anomaly so as to provide a value characteristic of the type (e.g., malignant or nonmalignant) of the anomaly. Alternatively or additionally, the area over which the pulsatile amplitude is different from the surrounding tissue is normalized based on the depth and/or size of the anomaly and accordingly a value characteristic of the type of the anomaly is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring in more detail to filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) the determined waveform, in some embodiments of the invention, frequencies generally due to motion artifacts and other noise are removed from the determined waveform. In some embodiments of the invention, spectral analysis techniques are used in performing the filtering. Alternatively or additionally, band pass filtering is used around the frequency of the cardiac cycle in order to remove unrelated noise from the determined waveform. For example, the filtering may discard all the frequencies not in the band of 0.02-4 Hz. In some embodiments of the invention, frequencies characteristic of cyclic effects other than the cardiac cycle, e.g., the pulmonary and sympathetic effects, are removed from the determined waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a waveform most closely characteristic of the cardiac cycle is extracted from the determined waveform. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the frequency of the cardiac cycle is determined from the sensed samples themselves. For example, circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> assumes that the frequency with the most distinct waveform is the frequency of the cardiac cycle and the waveform of this frequency is used in determining the pulsatile amplitude (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, the cardiac cycle frequency of the subject is determined (<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>), independent of the samples from probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, substantially concurrently with the sample taking of sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, using any of the methods known in the art. These methods may include direct measurement of the pulse and/or indirect measurement of consequences of the pulse. In some embodiments of the invention, the frequency of the cardiac cycle is determined using plethysmography measurements on an organ of the subject, other than breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, the plethysmography measurements are taken using electrical or light measurements as are known in the art. Alternatively or additionally, the frequency of the cardiac cycle is determined responsive to temperature changes of the subject&apos;s body surface. Further alternatively or additionally, the frequency of the cardiac cycle is determined responsive to variations in the magnetization of the subject&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>), is performed by searching for the extreme points of the sensed samples. In some embodiments of the invention, the extreme points are reviewed for their belonging to a desired waveform, e.g., a waveform which represents the cardiac cycle. Points not belonging to the desired waveform are weeded out. Alternatively or additionally, when no extreme points are included in the waveform for over a predetermined period, an extreme point is generated using suitable interpolation methods. In some embodiments of the invention, the reviewing of the extreme points includes fitting the extreme points to a plurality of pre-selected wavelets and choosing the wavelet which best fits the extreme points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, other processing methods may be used such as, for example, genetic algorithms, Markov models, neural networks and/or fuzzy logic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the reviewed extreme points are resampled into an even distribution in order to allow easy manipulation of the points in further processing, e.g., use of the fast frequency transform (FFT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally to filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) in order to determine the waveform of the cardiac cycle, other waveforms, cyclic or non-cyclic, which are indicative of physiological effects in the subject, are extracted from the determined (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) change waveform, using any of the methods described above. In some embodiments of the invention, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) is performed in order to extract other cyclic waveforms, for example, waveforms due to the pulmonary and/or sympathetic effects. Alternatively or additionally, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) is performed in order to extract a waveform which follows a related event, such as an internal and/or external stimuli. In some embodiments of the invention, the related event comprises an internal stimuli, such as a heart beat, for example in a subject with a non-regular cardiac cycle. In some embodiments of the invention, the external stimuli comprises pressure applied to the breast and/or a stimulate injected and/or otherwise applied to the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) includes relating to a portion of the waveform beginning a predetermined time (e.g., zero or longer) after the related event. Alternatively or additionally, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) includes relating to a portion following an expected response to the event. For example, the filtering (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) may include relating to a portion of the waveform having a predetermined shape or other characteristic, for example a portion beginning with a large peak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, to determining (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) the pulsatile amplitude of the filtered change waveform, the frequency, duration, shape and/or any other parameter of the filtered change waveform are used in detecting, locating and/or analyzing anomalies. In some embodiments of the invention, the time delay from the related event until it causes a noticeable effect in the filtered change waveform. A fast propagation of the effect of the related event may indicate, for example, an anomaly having a large number of blood vessels. Optionally, the propagation time of the related event is determined for a plurality of points and is displayed as a map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, a plurality of impedance imaging procedures such as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are performed with different stimulus. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a plurality of impedance imaging procedures are performed with different compression levels. Optionally, the breast is placed between a pair of compression plates which may apply different pressure levels to the breast. Impedance imaging procedures as described above are optionally performed with the plates applying different respective pressure levels to the breast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, in addition to the pulsatile amplitude, other measurements from region <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are used by processing circuitry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in generating indications on the existence, location and/or type of anomalies. In some embodiments of the invention, the other signal measurements from region <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> include additional information extracted from the signals sensed by probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as the value of the stationary portion of sensed samples (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). The processing of the stationary portion of the sensed samples, which is indicative of the impedance of a body portion beneath the sensor, may be performed, for example, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/460,699, filed Dec. 14, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference and/or in the above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,742. In some embodiments of the invention, a map of the pulsatile amplitudes is correlated with a map of the stationary portion of the sensed samples. In some embodiments, the map of the pulsatile amplitudes is overlaid on the map of the stationary portion of the sensed samples. Optionally, the overlaid map is displayed to a physician which searches for anomalies which have cancerous characteristics, i.e., an impedance indicative of cancerous flesh and a pulsatile amplitude indicative of high blood perfusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, the other signal measurements include signals detected by apparatus other than probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as ultrasound and X-ray imaging apparatus and/or as described in PCT application PCT/IL00/00287, filed May 21, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a breast checkup procedure comprises a plurality of stages. In a first stage, the breast is scanned using methods known in the art in order to determine whether there is a suspected anomaly within the breast. In a second stage, the precise location of the suspected anomaly is found, in particular the depth of the anomaly from surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An exemplary method for determining the depth is performed using applied dipole electrical signals as described in the above mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/460,699. Other methods, such as using x-ray and/or ultrasound imaging may also be used. In a third stage, electrification measurements are used to aid a physician in determining the type of the anomaly, i.e., whether the anomaly is cancerous or otherwise requires treatment, using the method described above with relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, optionally with other measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is replaced by a long and narrow electrode which is placed substantially beneath a suspected anomaly. Using a long and narrow electrode reduces the dimensionality of the current reaching probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directly from electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In some cases the direct current from electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may interfere with the detection of the current from an anomaly. These direct currents may be especially problematic when it is desired to extract the change waveform from the sensed signals. Alternatively or additionally, limited area electrodes of other shapes are used in applying signals to breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the dimensionality of the applied signals is reduced even more by using applied signals which partially cancel each other, for example by electrifying two parallel long and narrow electrodes with opposite phases, for example, as is now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of an impedance anomaly evaluation procedure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed on a surface of a breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which includes an anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Electrifying signals are applied to a long and narrow electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, located substantially below anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The electrification of electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> induces a dipole, indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, within the anomaly. The dipole in anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> induces within breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> an electrical field indicated by dashed lines <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The influence of the dipole induced within anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown schematically by a graph <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Graph <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a cross section of a normalized map formed by sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, taken above anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Blood volume changes in anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, due to the cardiac cycle, result in cyclic variations of the amplitude represented by graph <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The waveform of these cyclic variations is determined from the samples, providing an indication of the type of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, the amplitude of the waveform of the cyclic variations is indicative of the blood volume of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The larger the blood volume of the anomaly, the larger the amplitude of the cyclic variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the depth of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is determined, for example using methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/460,699, and the amplitude of the cyclic variations is normalized accordingly. Alternatively or additionally, the size of the anomaly is determined, using any method known in the art, and accordingly the amplitude of the cyclic variations is normalized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of an impedance anomaly evaluation procedure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Electrification signals are applied to breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from a pair of long and narrow electrodes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, located on opposite sides of the projection of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the surface of breast <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the present invention, electrifying signals of different phases, e.g., opposite polarities, are applied to electrodes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the invention, the applied signals are adjusted such that they induce within anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> a dipole, indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, which is substantially parallel to probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The influence of the dipole induced within anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown schematically by a graph <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Graph <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> has two peaks <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of substantially equal magnitude and opposite polarity. Blood volume changes in anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, due to the cardiac cycle, result in cyclic variations of the amplitude of graph <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The waveform of these cyclic variations is determined from the samples, providing an indication of the type of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The distance between peaks <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to the depth of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> beneath probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, the depth of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is determined by measuring the distance between peaks <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The determined depth of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is used to normalize any influence of the depth on the amplitude of the waveform of the changes of graph <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, such that the normalized graph is substantially only a function of the type of anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Additional normalization procedures may be used, for example, as described in the above mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/460,699. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the current due to direct influence from electrodes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> declines proportionally to the square of the distance and therefore interferes to a lesser extent in determining the current from anomaly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> than current from a single electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, during a tissue characterization procedure the amplitude of the signals applied to electrode <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is slowly changed until peaks <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are of substantially equal magnitude. Alternatively or additionally, the applied signals are changed until the movements of graph <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are most clearly determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, a synchronous detection method, for example as described hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is used to sense (<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) the samples by sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The use of synchronous detection reduces the affect of sporadic noise on the sampled signals. This reduction of the affect of the sporadic noise allows use of weaker excitation signals, use of lower resolution A/D converters and/or detection of weaker signals, i.e., higher detection resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram of apparatus <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for sensing currents for impedance imaging and/or tissue characterization, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In order to reduce the noise sensed by sensing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the excitation signals applied to electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are provided in pulses. In some embodiments of the invention, a modulator <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> produces the excitation signal at a suitable frequency for impedance procedures. A clock oscillator <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> controls a gate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> such that it passes the modulated signals to electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in pulses, for example, having a short duty cycle. In an embodiment of the invention, the signals are passed from gate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via a D/A converter <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> and an amplifier <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The signals sensed by sensing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are amplified, filtered and digitized as is known in the art. The amplification, filtering and digitization may be performed, for example, in an acquisition path <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> which may include a low noise differential amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an anti-aliasing filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a digital amplifier <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The signals from acquisition path <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are directed over two separate lines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The signals on line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are shifted such that the signals on lines <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are shifted relative to each other by 90&deg;. In an embodiment of the invention, the signals on line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are passed through a phase shifter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which shifts the signals by 90&deg;. The signals on line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and those received from phase shifter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are multiplied, in respective multipliers <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which serve as phase comparators, by a sine wave having the same period as the period of the pulses passed through gate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, the sine wave is generated by a wave generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is controlled by clock oscillator <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which controls gate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The multiplied signals from multipliers <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are low passed filtered, e.g., by a dual channel low pass filter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, in order to remove noise. In addition, the signals are filtered by a high pass filter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in order to reconstruct the signals from the pulse form they receive due to the pulse excitation. The signals are then combined using a combination unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments of the invention, combination unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> sums the squares of the signals on the lines and takes the square root of the sum. The combined signal is then processed to determine (<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) the change waveform, as described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Alternatively to using two multipliers <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and combination unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, a single multiplier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is used. The sine wave generator and/or a phase shifter of the signals from acquisition path <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> adjust the sine wave and/or the acquired signals such that they are phase aligned. A setting unit determines a required amount of phase shift of the sine wave and/or the acquired signals so that the sine wave and the acquired signals are aligned. It is noted, that the phase drift of the acquired signals is generally very slight and therefore the required amount of phase shift may be set once, e.g., upon power-on, or periodically at relatively large intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The advantages in the use of the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and/or the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is not limited to measurement of electrical currents using the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Rather, in some embodiments of the invention the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and/or the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are used with voltage measurements using the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or other apparatus, such as four electrode setups. Furthermore, in some embodiments of the invention, the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and/or the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are used to aid in detecting, locating and/or analyzing anomalies based on non-electrical signals. In some embodiments of the invention, excitation signals are applied using a near infrared LED and the detection is performed using one or more photo-diodes, e.g., a photo-diode array, such as a CCD. The LED and photo-diodes may be placed on opposite surfaces of an examined organ or may be aligned in any other manner known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, a probe is formed of two separable parts. A first part includes sensing apparatus, such as sensing elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which depends on the type of signals (e.g., electrical, light) detected. Optionally, this part of the probe also includes an excitation source (e.g., electrode, LED). The second part includes acquisition and/or processing circuitry which is independent of the type of signals detected. Thus, a single acquisition and/or processing circuitry part may be used with a plurality of sensing and/or excitation parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or any other probe used for detecting, locating and/or analyzing anomalies in accordance with embodiments of the invention, comprises a battery operated, optionally hand held, probe. By providing the excitation to the body portion in pulses rather than in continuous excitation, the power consumption of the probe is reduced. In some embodiments of the invention, the sampling rate and hence the excitation pulse rate of the probe is chosen as a compromise between the accuracy achieved by a large number of samples, and the reduction of power consumption achieved by reducing the excitation pulse rate. Alternatively or additionally, the length of the sample sensing period is chosen as a compromise between accuracy and power consumption. It is noted that during long measurement periods the cardiac cycle may change and therefore very long sampling periods may not be advantageous for accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, before and/or during an anomaly detection, location and/or characterization procedure, materials which enhance the blood volume difference between an anomaly and surrounding tissue are injected to an inspected organ. Alternatively or additionally, materials which arise detectable biological signals, such as the sympathetic effect, are injected to the inspected organ. In some embodiments of the invention, the materials are injected generally to the inspected organ in the vicinity of the anomaly. Alternatively or additionally, the materials are injected directly into the anomaly, for example in a tissue characterization procedure. Exemplary materials include, for example, vasoconstriction and/or vasodilatation materials which are injected to the blood stream of the subject. Further alternatively or additionally, measures are taken to enhance the breathing rate of the subject, and thus enhance the changes in blood volume in suspected anomalies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, before and/or during an inspection procedure, measures are taken in order to minimize irregularities in the subjects cardiac cycle. In some embodiments of the invention, a pulsatile regulation material, such as lidocain, is injected to the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It is noted that although the present invention is not limited to detection, localization and/or analysis procedures of anomalies in the breast. Rather, the embodiments of the present invention may be used with many other human organs, for example, to aid in skin cancer detection, Cervical carcinoma detection and/or thyroid cancer detection. Furthermore, the embodiments of the invention may be used in tissue characterization in animals. It is further noted that the signal detection method described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be used in detecting other low frequency biological signals. </paragraph>

It should also be appreciated that the above described description of methods and apparatus are to be interpreted as including apparatus for carrying out the methods and methods of using the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described using non-limiting detailed descriptions of embodiments thereof that are provided by way of example and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
