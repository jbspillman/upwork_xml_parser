<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In TABLE 1, it is noted that a high voltage difference is generated between the source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the floating gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by applying a 12V bias voltage to the source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when erasing the memory cell <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, whereby the charges stored in the floating gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are forced to flow into the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the high voltage difference between the source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the floating gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be derived by applying a &minus;9V bias voltage to the control gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which will be coupled to the floating gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a 6V bias voltage to the source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the erasing of the memory cell <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is determined by the bias voltage CG and CS respectively applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and common source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while the bias voltage SG and D are 0 or floating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, all the memory cells <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in one column are erased simultaneously since their control gates are electrically connected and their sources are electrically connected, i.e., they receive the same bias voltage CG for the control gates and the same bias voltage CS for the common sources. It is impossible to erase only one memory cell <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the conventional EEPROM. The invention provides a solution for this problem. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are directed to an improved EEPROM in which the memory cells can be selectively erased. If the control gates of the memory cells are electrically connected, their sources are electrically isolated from each other, so that the memory cells may receive a common bias voltage for the control gates but different bias voltages for the sources. It is possible to erase only one memory cell by providing the to-be-erased memory cell with a bias voltage for the source different from the bias voltage provided to the sources of the other memory cells. Alternatively, if the same bias voltage is provided to the sources of the memory cells, their control gates are electrically isolated from each other, so that the memory cells may receive different bias voltages for the control gates. It is possible to erase only one memory cell by providing the to-be-erased memory cell with a bias voltage for the control gate different from the bias voltage provided to the control gates of the other memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory comprises a first memory cell having a first control gate and a first source, and a second memory cell having second control gate and a second source. If the first and second control gates are configured to receive a control gate voltage, the first source is configured to receive a first source voltage, and the second source is configured to receive a second source voltage different from the first source voltage so as to erase one of the first and second memory cells and to preserve another of the first and second memory cells. If the first and second sources are configured to receive a source voltage, the first control gate is configured to receive a first control gate voltage, and the second control gate is configured to receive a second control gate voltage different from the first control gate voltage so as to erase one of the first and second memory cells and to preserve another of the first and second memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the first memory cell comprises a first floating gate, a first select gate, and a first drain; and the second memory cell comprises a second floating gate, a second select gate, and a second drain. The first drain and the second drain are electrically coupled together. The first select gate and the second select gate are electrically coupled together. The first source voltage is sufficiently higher than the control gate voltage to erase the first memory cell and the second source voltage is not sufficiently higher than the control gate voltage to erase the second memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the first source voltage is higher than the control gate voltage by at least about 12V. The second source voltage is higher than the control gate voltage by no more than about 9V, or by no more than about 6V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, the first and second control gates have a control gate voltage of about &minus;9V, the first source has a first source voltage of at least about 6V, and the second source has a second source voltage of no greater than about 0V. The first and second control gates each have a control gate voltage of about 0V, the first source has a first source voltage of at least about 12V, and the second source has a second source voltage of no greater than about 0V. The first and second sources have a source voltage of about 6V, the first control gate has a first control gate voltage of no greater than about &minus;9V, and the second control gate has a second control gate voltage of at least about 0V. The first and second sources have a source voltage of about 12V, the first control gate has a first control gate voltage of no greater than about 0V, and the second control gate has a second control gate voltage of at least about 6V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed to an erasing method for an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory having a first memory cell and a second memory cell, wherein the first memory cell has a first control gate and a first source and the second memory cell has second control gate and a second source. The method comprises either (1) providing a control gate voltage to the first and second control gates, providing a first source voltage to the first source, and providing a second source voltage to the second source which is different from the first source voltage so as to erase one of the first and second memory cells and to preserve another of the first and second memory cells; or (2) providing a source voltage to the first and second sources, providing a first control gate voltage to the first control gate, and providing a second control gate voltage to the second control gate which is different from the first control gate voltage so as to erase one of the first and second memory cells and to preserve another of the first and second memory cells.</paragraph>

Therefore, the erasing of the memory cell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is determined by the bias voltage CG&prime; and CS&prime; respectively applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and source <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> while the bias voltage SG and D are 0 or floating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the invention, all the memory cells <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in one column have a common control gate but their sources are electrically isolated from each other, whereby they can receive a common bias voltage CG&prime; but different bias voltage CS&prime;. It is possible to erase only one memory cell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in one column by providing the to-be-erased cell with a bias voltage CS&prime; different from those provided for others in the column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the previously described embodiment, the control gates <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the cells in one column are connected but the sources <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are electrically isolated. The sources <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cells in one column can receive different voltages while the voltages on the control gates <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are the same. Conversely, the control gates <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the cells in one row can receive the same voltage while the voltages on the sources <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are different. It is possible to erase only one cell by providing different source voltages to the cells in one column. For example, one of the cells in one column is provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, &minus;9, 6 and 0 respectively. The other cells in the column are provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, &minus;9, 0 and 0 respectively. This causes insufficient voltage differences between the sources and control gates to erase the other cells. Only the cell provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, &minus;9, 6 and 0 respectively is erased. Alternatively, one of the cells in one column is provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 12 and 0 respectively. The other cells in the column are provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 0 and 0 respectively. This causes insufficient voltage differences between the sources and control gates to erase the other cells. Only the cell provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 12 and 0 respectively is erased. Alternatively, one of the cells in one row is provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, &minus;9, 6 and 0 respectively. The other cells in the row are provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 6 and 0 respectively. This causes insufficient voltage differences between the sources and control gates to erase the other cells. Only the cell provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, &minus;9, 6 and 0 respectively is erased. Alternatively, one of the cells in one row is provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 12 and 0 respectively. The other cells in the row are provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 6, 12 and 0 respectively. This causes insufficient voltage differences between the sources and control gates to erase the other cells. Only the cell provided with voltages SG&prime;, CG&prime;, S and CD which are 0, 0, 12 and 0 respectively is erased. </paragraph>
