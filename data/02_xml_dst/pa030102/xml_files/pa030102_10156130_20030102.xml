<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel compositions comprising, formulated into appropriate vehicle, diluent or carrier, at least one substance or species which is active with respect to the trophicity/nutrition of the cutaneous nerves and/or at least one neurostimulant and/or at least one neuroactivator and/or at least one neuromediator, particularly of sensory cutaneous nerves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention also relates to the administration, whether topically or orally, of at least one substance or species which is active with respect to the trophicity of the cutaneous nerves and/or at least one neurostimulant and/or at least one neuroactivator and/or at least one neuromediator, to maintain and/or to increase the thickness of the skin, particularly the thickness of the epidermis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In mammals in general, particularly in man, the skin is composed of two compartments, namely, a deep compartment which acts as a support, the dermis, and a compartment communicating with the external environment, the epidermis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The natural epidermis is composed mainly of three types of cells, which are keratinocytes, melanocytes and Langerhans&apos; cells, the vast majority being keratinocytes. Each of these cell types contributes by its specific functions to the essential role played by the skin in the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The dermis provides the epidermis with a solid support. It is also its source of nutrients. It is mainly composed of fibroblasts and of an extra-cellular matrix itself composed mainly of collagen, of elastin and of a substance referred to as ground substance, which components are synthesized by the fibroblast. It also comprises leukocytes, mastocytes or tissue macrophages. It is also traversed by blood vessels and nerve fibers, which thus constitute the cutaneous nervous system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The cutaneous nervous system has sensory and neurovegetative functions. The sensory function is mediated by receptors which will convert the stimuli received into influxes. These influxes will return to the sensory nerve center of the spinal cord (spinal ganglion) and then the brain, where the information is assimilated. The receptors include mecanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and nocioceptors. The neurovegetative function makes possible the innervation of the dermal vessels, sweat glands and hair-erector muscles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Cutaneous innervation permits varying the immune functions via neurotransmitters. Thus, because of its ubiquitous distribution, the cutaneous innervation is implicated in numerous physiological functions (thermoregulation, vasomotor function, immunomodulation or neurogenic inflammation) (Pincelli C., Fantini F., Giannetti A., &ldquo;Neuropeptides and Skin Inflammation,&rdquo; Dermatology, 1993, 187, 153-8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The sensory cutaneous innervation constitutes the largest fraction of the dermal and epidermal network. The majority of the sensory nerve fibers are surrounded by Schwann cells. These fibers are of A-delta type (myelinated) or of C-type (nonmyelinated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The intraepidermal nerve fibers are distributed up to the layers closest to the surface of the epidermis. They originate from nerve bundles of the upper dermis and appear as free endings. These are very fine branchings which can rise directly into the surface layers of the epidermis, or along a more winding route between the keratinocytes, losing their myelin sheath and their Schwann cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Recently, an ultrastructural study coupled to immunohistochemical labelings has confirmed the existence of nerve endings in the epidermis. These structures are encountered in the intercellular spaces of all the vital layers of the epidermis, up to those closest to the surface. They establish contacts with the cellular bodies and the cytoplasmic extensions of the keratinocytes by apposition of &ldquo;membrane to membrane&rdquo; type, but without any structure of synaptic appearance being observed (Hilliges M., Wang L., Johansson O., &ldquo;Ultrastructural evidence for nerve fibers within all vital layers of the human epidermis,&rdquo; J. Invest. Dermatol., 1995, 104, 134-7). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The neuromediators exert paracrine and autocrine effects on the cutaneous cells. In the other direction, they are the carriers of nerve information from the periphery to the central nervous system. They allow the nervous system to be continuously informed of the events which are taking place at the periphery (cutaneous sensations) and thus, in reply, to control the principal physiological functions of the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Keratinocytes have receptors for substance P (Staniek V., Misery L., Peguet-Navarro J., Abello J., Doutremepuich J., Claudy A., Schmitt D., &ldquo;Binding and in vitro modulation of human epidermal Langerhans cell functions by substance P,&rdquo; Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1997, 289, 285-92), for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), for calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and for neuropeptide Y (Takahashi K. et al., &ldquo;Direct effects of cutaneous neuropeptides on adenylyl cyclase activity and proliferation in a keratinocyte cell line: stimulated cyclic AMP formation by CGRP and VIP/PHM, and inhibited NPY through G protein-coupled receptors,&rdquo; J. Invest. Dermatol., 1993, 101, 646-51), for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) (Staniek V. et al., &ldquo;Expression of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in human skin, &rdquo; Acta Derm. Venereol., 1996, 76, 282-6) and for acetyl-choline (muscarinic or nicotinic) (Grando SA. et al., &ldquo;Keratinocyte muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: immunolocalization and partial characterization,&rdquo; J. Invest. Dermatol., 1995, 104, 95-100). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Immunohistochemical methods have demonstrated that the receptor for nerve cell growth factor (NGF) is expressed on the basal keratinocytes of normal human skin. The messenger RNAs of the high- and low-affinity receptors for NGF were detected in cultured human keratinocytes (Pincelli C. et al., &ldquo;Expression and function of nerve growth factor receptor on cultured keratinocytes,&rdquo; J. Invest. Dermatol., 1994, 103, 13-8). NGF induces the proliferation of the keratinocytes rather than their differentiation. This proliferation is greater than that effected by epidermal growth factor (EGF). An autocrine function of NGF could be demonstrated since the keratinocytes are also capable of synthesizing and of secreting NGF (Pincelli, &ldquo;Expression and function of nerve growth factor receptor on cultured keratinocytes,&rdquo; J. Invest. Dermatol., 1994, 103, 13-8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It too is known that the thickness of the epidermis decreases during chronobiological aging. The cell divisions of the basal layer decline in number. The replacement time of the horny cells becomes longer. The maturing of these cells is imperfect and the keratinization no longer results in the creation of an even and homogeneous horny layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is also known that, in the case of certain disease states, such as ichthyosis, the skin is subjected to damage due to lack of cell proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is also known that, at menopause, cutaneous aging accelerates, that the thickness of the skin decreases and that women complain that their skin is tight and that it assumes the appearance of &ldquo;dry skin&rdquo;, indeed even the appearance of xerosis. It is known that hormonal deficiencies associated with menopause are accompanied by a general slowdown in cell metabolism, from which it can be assumed all the same that the effects which women experience are related in particular to a decrease in the proliferation of the keratinocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The consequence of the above is, thus, that the skin becomes thinner in the course of aging. As the skin is the natural barrier to external attacks and challenges, it is logical to believe that the thicker the skin, the more the sensitivity of the latter should decrease (significant barrier effect). Conversely, the thinner the skin, the more its sensitivity should be increased (increased accessibility to the nerve endings). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It has now unexpectedly and surprisingly been determined, contrary to conventional wisdom, that the thinner the epidermis, the more nerve sensitivity decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, the decrease in the thickness of the epidermis observed during aging is correlated with a decrease in cutaneous innervation, the latter having as a consequence a decrease in the supply of neuromediators and/or nerve growth factors, which might result in a decrease, indeed even in a halt, in the proliferation of the cells of the epidermis, particularly of the keratinocytes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE AND SPECIFIC/PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> More particularly according to the present invention, it has now been determined that, to combat the decrease in the thickness of the skin related to aging, particularly in the thickness of the epidermis, a composition can be administered to an individual subject in need of such treatment, for example via topical application onto the skin, comprising at least one substance or species which is active with respect to the trophicity of the cutaneous nerves and/or at least one neurostimulant and/or at least one neuroactivator, particularly of sensory cutaneous nerves. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Methodology: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (a) Number of subjects: 122 women aged from 60 to 80 years; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (b) Measurement of the thresholds for cutaneous detection of cold: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> This measurement was carried out with the Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA 2001 Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel), the probe of which is capable, by the Peltier effect, of cooling the skin along a calibrated temperature gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The threshold for sensitivity to cold was thus detected beginning from a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; temperature for the skin of 32&deg; C. It was sufficient for the subject, as soon as she experienced a change in temperature, to indicate via a pushbutton, which action automatically resulted in the thermal stimulus being halted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A series of 5 stimuli (below 32&deg; C.) was recorded and a mean was calculated in order to determine the detection threshold. This measurement was carried out on the face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (c) Measurement of the thickness of the epidermis: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the epidermis was measured by high-resolution (25 MHz) ultrasonic echography on the back of the hand (Querleux B, L&eacute;v&euml;que J L, de Rigal J: In vivo cross sectional ultrasonic imaging of human skin. <highlight><italic>Dermatologica, </italic></highlight>1988, 77, 332-337). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The mean values of the thickness of the epidermis for various thresholds for detection of cold are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The greater the detection temperature, the greater the sensitivity of the skin to cold and the greater the thickness of the epidermis. On the other hand, the lower the sensitivity of the skin to cold, the more the epidermis had atrophied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (b) Measurement of the thresholds for cutaneous detection of heat and of cold (thermal sensitivity): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This measurement was carried out according to the protocol described in Example 1 on the upper lip (cutaneous part) in the right or left side region according to the randomization plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Results: (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Measurements of the Sensitivity to Capsaicin as a Function of Age </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Methodology: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Subjects: 152 women aged from 18 to 65 years old: 35 were less than 30 years old; 32 were between 30 and 40 years old; 43 were between 41 and 50 years old; 20 were between 51 and 60 years old; 21 were more than 60 years old. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Capsaicin test: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The capsaicin test employs a natural compound from the family of the alkaloids present in the fruits of various species of the belladonna family. Capsaicin is the hot substance present in the capsicums. The application of capsaicin to the skin promotes a brief release of substance P in the nerve endings, the consequence of which is the appearance of feelings of burning and of tingling, sometimes accompanied by a localized erythema at the application region. These reactions are transitory and completely reversible in the hours which follow. These reactions are directly related to sensory innervation; the greater the latter, the greater the reaction, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> (i) Application of 20 mg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of Zostrix HP (cream comprising 0.075% of capsaicin) to a site of 4 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at the angle of the jaw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> (ii) Gradings (scale with 4 levels) by the subject of the sensations of tingling, inflammation and itching experienced at 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min after the application of capsaicin according to the following scale: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 0&equals;Absence of reaction; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 1&equals;Slight or doubtful feeling; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> 2&equals;Moderate or clearcut feeling; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> 3&equals;Strong or significant feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> (iii) Clinical evaluations of the erythema by the investigator at 3 min, 5 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min according to the following scale: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> 0&equals;Absence of reaction; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> 1&equals;Slight or doubtful erythema; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> 2&equals;Moderate erythema localized at the application region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> 3&equals;Significant erythema with extension beyond the limits of the application region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Results (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> These results indicate a marked reduction in the scores for the various age categories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The three preceding examples clearly evidence a reduction in the cutaneous sensitivity correlated with a decrease in the thickness of the epidermis during aging. The first example furthermore evidences a decrease in the thickness of the epidermis correlated with a loss in sensitivity to cold. </paragraph>
