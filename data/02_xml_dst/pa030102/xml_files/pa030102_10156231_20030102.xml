<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device and a process for controlling at least one aerodynamic elevator surface of an aircraft, during a takeoff phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known that, to achieve aircraft takeoff, the pilot accelerates this aircraft over the runway, until it reaches a speed Vr (at a time tr) at which he actuates a control member of the aircraft, for example a ministick. This actuation brings about the movement of the aerodynamic elevator surfaces, of the elevators type, this having the effect of raising the nose of the aircraft, the nose gear of which lifts off the ground, the aircraft continuing to run over the runway by means of its main gear. The aircraft is then still in the acceleration phase, its longitudinal axis being inclined by a pitch attitude angle &thgr; with respect to the runway. When the aircraft reaches a speed Vlof, at a duration T after the actuation of the control member, the wheels of the main gear leave the runway in turn and takeoff is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, before takeoff is achieved, while the aircraft is running on the runway, there is a risk of the aircraft touching said runway with the rear part of its fuselage if the pitch attitude angle exhibits too high a value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, the change in the attitude angle &thgr; between the times tr and tr&plus;T satisfies a particular control law, according to which said attitude angle &thgr; increases as a function of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Consequently, if the pilot actuates the control member at a low speed Vr, the time T required to reach the speed Vlof is large so that, the attitude angle &thgr; increasing as a function of time, it is possible to reach a value of attitude angle &thgr; which is very high at the time tr&plus;T, and which may be such that the rear part of the fuselage touches the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, to reduce the takeoff distance, the pilot may be obliged to take off with minimum speeds Vr and Vlof, this requiring the nose of the aircraft to be raised further thereby increasing the attitude angle. Of course this heightens the risk of touching the ground with the rear part of the fuselage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This risk is all the greater the longer the aircraft and hence the bigger the distance L between its main gear and said rear part of the fuselage. Specifically, for a given height of gear, the critical angle &thgr;q for which the rear part of the aircraft touches the ground decreases as the distance L increases. For example, on an aircraft of the &ldquo;Airbus A340&rdquo; type, the critical angle &thgr;q is of the order of from 13.5&deg; to 14&deg;, the value of &thgr; during takeoff with a minimum speed Vr being of the order of from 12&deg; to 12.5&deg; depending on the configuration of the aircraft. As a result of this, the margin of the attitude angle &thgr; at takeoff is of the order of only 1.5&deg;. The risk of touching the ground with the rear part of the fuselage and hence of damaging the aircraft must consequently be taken into consideration. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Patent FR-2 711 257 discloses a control system for elevators of an aircraft comprising means making it possible to attenuate the control signal of said elevators, as a function of the attitude angle &thgr; of the aircraft. The attenuation increases, up to a specified threshold, as the angle &thgr; increases. By attenuating the increase in &thgr; as a function of time, such a system reduces the risk of touching the ground with the rear part of the fuselage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, this risk is not completely eradicated. Specifically, despite this attenuation, for a very large time T, the attitude angle &thgr; may reach the aforesaid critical value &thgr;q. Moreover, this known system has the drawback of attenuating the rate of rotation (or variation of attitude as a function of time) in all cases, even when the speed Vr is high enough for there to be no risk of touching the ground with the rear part of the fuselage. In this case, this known system needlessly lengthens the time required to reach the value of the attitude angle &thgr; allowing takeoff to be achieved, this obviously having the effect of increasing the distance required for takeoff. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for controlling at least one aerodynamic elevator surface of an aircraft, during a takeoff phase, which makes it possible to remedy the aforesaid drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To this end, said process is noteworthy, according to the invention, in that, during the acceleration of the aircraft running along the ground with a view to takeoff, as soon as a pilot actuates a control member for controlling said aerodynamic elevator surface in such a way as to increase the pitch attitude angle of the aircraft with respect to the ground, at a ground running speed Vr: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a) a speed Vlofmin is determined at which the last wheels of the aircraft leave the ground in the case of a takeoff for which the pitch attitude angle is controlled according to a nominal control law and exhibits at this speed Vlofmin a nominal value &thgr;nom which is below, by a predefined margin, a critical value &thgr;q of pitch attitude angle, for which the aircraft touches the ground at the rear with a part of its fuselage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> b) the duration T required for the aircraft to go from the speed Vr to this speed Vlofmin is determined; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> c) this duration T is compared with a nominal duration Tnom which corresponds to the duration required for the aircraft to go, according to a nominal control law, from a pitch attitude of running &thgr;r (at the speed Vr) to said pitch attitude of nominal value &thgr;nom; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> d) from this comparison is deduced a control law for the pitch attitude angle, which is applied to the aircraft and which corresponds: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> if the duration T is less than or equal to the nominal duration Tnom, to said nominal control law; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> if the duration T is greater than the nominal duration Tnom, to a modified control law which is such that at a duration T after the actuation of the control member by the pilot, the pitch attitude angle of the aircraft is substantially equal to said nominal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, by virtue of the invention, when there is a risk of the fuselage of the aircraft touching the ground when the aerodynamic elevator surface is controlled by a nominal (theoretical) control law, a modified law which prevents such contact is applied to said aerodynamic surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there is no longer any risk of contact, this of course being a considerable advantage in respect of safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Moreover, unlike the solution proposed by the aforesaid patent FR-2 711 257, the nominal control law is modified only when actually necessary for safety. In the converse case, the aircraft is still controlled according to the nominal control law which has the advantage (as will be seen hereinbelow) of representing the actuation of the control member by the pilot more faithfully. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Preferably, said modified control law substantially follows the nominal control law for a duration of 3T/4 starting from the actuation of the control member by the pilot, then deviates from this nominal control law so that at the duration T the pitch attitude angle of the aircraft is substantially equal to said nominal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, for a major part of the time lying between tr and tr&plus;T, the modified control law remains close to the nominal (theoretical) control law. The advantage of this for the pilot is that he feels, for as long as possible, the effect of his action on the control member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Additionally, advantageously, the state of at least one parameter of the aircraft which is capable of taking one of at least two states is determined and, for each of the states of said parameter, a different nominal control law and a different modified control law are used. In this case, when the aircraft is fitted with at least two engines, said parameter relates, preferably, to the operation of said engines, one of the states corresponding to normal operation of all the engines and the other state corresponding to a failure of one of said engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, in the aforesaid step a), the duration T is determined as a function of parameters of the aircraft, of the acceleration of the aircraft at the moment of the actuation of the control member by the pilot, and of the state of the engines of the aircraft. This can be achieved: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> by solving the following equation:

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Additionally, advantageously, the speed Vlofmin which is used to determine the duration T is determined as a function of the mass of the aircraft, of its configuration, of the state of its engines and of its environment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> a control member, for example a ministick, which is capable of being actuated by a pilot and which is associated with a means (position sensor for example) delivering a signal which is representative of such an actuation; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> means for determining the duration T required for the aircraft to go from the speed Vr to the speed Vlofmin; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> a step illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, which begins at a time tr, at which the pilot actuates the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so as to control said aerodynamic elevator surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such a way as to increase the pitch attitude angle &thgr; of the aircraft Av which corresponds to the angle between the longitudinal axis L of the aircraft Av and the ground S, this having the effect of raising the nose of the aircraft Av, whose nose gear <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> lifts off the ground, the aircraft Av continuing to run along the runway S by means of its main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The aircraft Av is then still in the acceleration phase. This actuation takes place at a ground running speed Vr; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> a step of actual takeoff, when the aircraft Av reaches a particular speed Vlof, the wheels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> leaving the runway S in turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> However, before takeoff is achieved, while the aircraft Av is running along the runway S, there is a risk of said aircraft Av touching said runway S with the rear part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of its fuselage F if the pitch attitude angle &thgr; exhibits too high a value, and which is (greater than or) equal to a critical value &thgr;q of pitch attitude angle for which there is contact. This critical value &thgr;q is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention makes it possible to eradicate such a risk and thus to prevent the rear part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the fuselage F of the aircraft Av from touching the ground S on takeoff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To do this, according to the invention, said calculation means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprise: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for determining the duration T required for the aircraft Av to go from the speed Vr to the speed Vlofmin; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> means (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) for comparing this duration T with a nominal duration Tnom which corresponds to the duration required for the aircraft Av to go from a running pitch attitude &thgr;r (not represented explicitly, but close to zero and even slightly less than zero in the example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) at the speed Vr to an attitude of nominal value &thgr;nom during a nominal takeoff, for which the pitch attitude angle &thgr; is controlled according to a nominal theoretical control law, this nominal value &thgr;nom being below, by a predefined margin (preferably 2&deg;), the critical value &thgr;q of pitch attitude angle, for which the aircraft Av touches the ground S at the rear with a part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of its fuselage F; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for deducing from this comparison the control law for the pitch attitude angle &thgr;, which is transmitted to the motor means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, this control law corresponding: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> if the duration T is less than or equal to the nominal duration Tnom, to said nominal theoretical control law; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> if the duration T is greater than the nominal duration Tnom, to a modified control law which is such that at a duration T after the actuation (which takes place at t&equals;tr) of the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the pilot, hence at an instant t&equals;tr&plus;T, the pitch attitude angle &thgr; of the aircraft Av is substantially equal to said nominal value &thgr;nom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The action carried out by the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention can be properly understood by referring to the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In this <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the curve A illustrates the nominal control law for the attitude angle &thgr;. According to this nominal control law, the attitude angle &thgr; varies as a function of time t, starting from the moment tr (actuation of the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the pilot) at which the angle &thgr; is slightly less than 0, since the aircraft Av is then slightly inclined downwards at the front. Moreover, at the time t&equals;tr&plus;Tnom, the attitude angle &thgr; takes the nominal value &thgr;nom, which is, by definition, less than the critical value &thgr;q at which the rear part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the fuselage F of the aircraft Av touches the ground. Of course, said critical value &thgr;q depends on the height of the main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the length between said part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and said main gear <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and may easily be determined for each aircraft Av. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, if the duration T (duration between the actuation of the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the moment at which the aircraft Av leaves the ground S) is less than (or equal to) the duration Tnom, the maximum attitude angle obtained at the time t&equals;tr&plus;T, when the aircraft leaves the ground, is less than (or equal to) the nominal angle &thgr;nom. In this case, there is therefore no risk of contact with the ground S. Consequently, the nominal control law A can in this case be used in complete safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the duration T is greater than the duration Tnom, as is represented by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is necessary to use a modified control law, such as the law B. Indeed, in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, according to law A, at a time t&equals;tr&plus;Tq (that is to say before the time t&equals;tr&plus;T at which the aircraft Av leaves the ground), the attitude angle &thgr; takes the value &thgr;q illustrating contact with the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the modified control law B is used, at the time t&equals;tr&plus;T, the attitude angle takes the nominal value &thgr;nom. Take off therefore occurs without risk of contact with the ground S, by using this modified control law B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one still uses the modified control law C which, as may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, substantially follows the nominal control law A for a large duration, for example of the order of 3T/4, starting from the actuation of the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the pilot, then one deviates from this nominal control law A so that at the duration T (time t&equals;tr&plus;T), the pitch attitude angle &thgr; of the aircraft Av is substantially equal to said nominal value &thgr;nom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Thus, for a major part of the time lying between t&equals;tr and t&equals;tr&plus;T, the modified control law C remains close to the nominal control law A (theoretical) . The advantage of this for the pilot is that it allows him to feel, for as long as possible, the effect of his action on the control member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the curve A can correspond to a nominal law such as that used, for example, in patent FR-2 711 257 before attenuation. Curve B is attenuated with respect to curve A, by applying for example a coefficient C0&lt;1 to the latter. The curve C, for its part, can for example be defined as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Solving this equation (4) makes it possible to calculate the duration T. To do this, it is of course necessary to know the way in which the acceleration Acc changes from tr to T. This change in the acceleration depends on numerous parameters, known to specialists in aeronautics and available onboard the aircraft Av, such as the thrust of the engines and the position of the control surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (these parameters resulting from the application of the control law), the speed Vr, the acceleration Acc(tr), the atmospheric conditions, the mass of the aircraft Av, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the case where one wishes to simplify the calculation of the duration T, it is possible to calculate an approximate value of the latter by using the following expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>&equals;(Vlofmin&minus;<highlight><italic>Vr</italic></highlight>)/Amoy &emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> where Amoy is the average acceleration over the time interval &lsqb;tr; tr&plus;T&rsqb;, that is to say when the speed goes from Vr to Vlofmin. In practice, this average acceleration Amoy can be estimated by applying a coefficient k&lt;1 to the acceleration Acc(tr) measured at the instant tr for a speed Vr. For example, for a modern civil four-engine airplane of the &ldquo;Airbus A340&rdquo; type, the calculations show that an average value of k&ap;0.8 is in practice suitable for the operational conditions. However, the coefficient k can, if necessary, be a variable of a few very influential parameters. This coefficient k makes it possible to take account of the reduction in the acceleration after the instant tr on account of the increase in the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft Av, due to the increase in the latter&apos;s pitch attitude &thgr;, and of the change with speed in the thrust of the engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that if the parameters of the aircraft alter during the takeoff phase between tr and tr&plus;T (for example on account of a fault with an engine), the average acceleration Amoy is recalculated so as to determine a new value of T and to modify the control law if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For a given type of aircraft, the application of a control law &thgr;(t) makes it possible to calculate the time Tnom corresponding to the attitude angle &thgr;nom. Given that two distinct steering laws are generally applied depending on the state of the engines (&ldquo;AEO&rdquo;/&ldquo;OEI&rdquo;), the two values of Tnom corresponding to these states &ldquo;AEO&rdquo; and &ldquo;OEI&rdquo; of the engines are therefore calculated a priori (of course, if one is obliged to use other control laws as a function of the values of particular parameters of the aircraft, then as many values of Tnom as there are possible control laws should be calculated). For example, in the case of a civil four-engine airplane, the time Tnom can be equal to around 5 seconds for the AEO configuration and to around 6 seconds for the OEI configuration. </paragraph>

<claim-text>motor means (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) for controlling said aerodynamic elevator surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) as a function of a control law (A, B, C) received from said calculation means (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), </claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein said motor means (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) control said aerodynamic elevator surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) at least between the moment of a first actuation of the control member (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) by the pilot so as to control said aerodynamic elevator surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) in such a way as to increase the pitch attitude angle of the aircraft (Av) with respect to the ground (S) at a ground running speed Vr and the moment at which the last wheels (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the aircraft (Av) leave the ground (S) at a running speed Vlof, and wherein said calculation means (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) comprise: 
<claim-text>means (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) for determining the duration T required for the aircraft (Av) to go from the speed Vr to the speed Vlofmin; </claim-text>
<claim-text>means (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) for comparing this duration T with a nominal duration Tnom which corresponds to the duration required for the aircraft (Av) to go from a running pitch attitude to an attitude of nominal value (&thgr;nom) during a nominal takeoff, for which the pitch attitude angle (&thgr;) is controlled according to a nominal control law (A), this nominal value (&thgr;nom) being below, by a predefined margin, a critical value (&thgr;q) of pitch attitude angle, for which the aircraft (Av) touches the ground (S) at the rear with a part (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of its fuselage (F); and </claim-text>
<claim-text>means (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) for deducing from this comparison the control law (A, B, C) for the pitch attitude angle (&thgr;), which is transmitted to the motor means (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), this control law corresponding: 
<claim-text>if the duration T is less than or equal to the nominal duration Tnom, to said nominal control law (A); and </claim-text>
<claim-text>if the duration T is greater than the nominal duration Tnom, to a modified control law (B, C) which is such that at a duration T after the actuation of the control member (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) by the pilot, the pitch attitude angle (&thgr;) of the aircraft (Av) is substantially equal to said nominal value (&thgr;nom).</claim-text>
