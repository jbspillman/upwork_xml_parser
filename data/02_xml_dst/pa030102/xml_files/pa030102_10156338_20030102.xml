<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to communication systems wherein WEB servers are hosted in a server farm connected to the Internet network, and relates in particular to a system for monitoring the availability of a path through the server farm between a user and any one of the WEB servers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Today, a server farm typically includes a scalable infrastructure and all the facilities and resources needed to enable users to easily access a number of services. Generally, such resources are located in premises owned by a data processing equipment provider such as the IBM Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most server farms are used today to host WEB servers of one or several customers. The network architecture of such a server farm typically includes at least two main parts: a local network to which the customer WEB servers are connected, and an Internet front-end that connects this local network to the Internet. The local network comprises different kinds of components such as Internet Access routers, Bandwidth controllers, switches and Firewalls through which requests from the users connected to the Internet are routed. The server farm is connected to the Internet via multiple links supported by Internet Service Provider (ISP) routers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When contracting with customers for hosting their WEB servers, the owner of the server often farm commits to Service Level Agreements, which means that the server farm owner agrees to provide full availability of connectivity to the customer servers as well as low delay on the connections to these servers. To achieve this goal, it is necessary for the server farm provider to continually monitor the availability of the hosted WEB servers and also to measure their response times. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide an in situ control system for periodically monitoring the availability of the server farm resources within a communication system wherein the WEB servers of a customer are hosted in a server farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an in situ control system for periodically measuring the response time of a path between a user and WEB server hosted in a server farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention relates therefore to a control system in a communication system comprising a server farm connected by means of Internet Service Provider (ISP) routers to the Internet network or the like, wherein the server farm includes at least a customer WEB server and server farm resources enabling any user connected to the Internet network to access the customer WEB server by using the server farm resources, such a control system including at least one Service Level Agreement (SLA) server for periodically monitoring the availability of a path to be used by the user to access the WEB server. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In order to monitor the availability and performance actually experienced by a user who accesses a server within the farm, it would be ideal to use the same path taken by end users connecting from the Internet to the customer WEB server. To implement such a practice, the best placement of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) servers would be within the Internet, outside the farm. As this placement outside the farm is impractical, according to the present invention the SLA servers are located inside the farm, and monitor two half paths, one to the Internet Service Provider routers and one to the WEB servers. A correlation is then made between the results over the two half paths to simulate the real path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, two SLA servers are used. They run in a High Availability mode (HACMP) with a heartbeat mechanism between them for failure detection. Only one SLA server is active at a time and the second one is used for backup in case of failure of the active SLA server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> communication system wherein the invention is implemented includes a server farm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a data transmission network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as the Internet network (or another Internet Protocol (IP) network such as an Intranet network). Internet network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is linked to server farm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of Internet Service Provider (ISP) routers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The ISP routers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are respectively connected, inside server farm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to Internet Access routers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A plurality of users <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connected to Internet network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can access a customer WEB server <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> hosted in server farm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by using the resources of the server farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Within server farm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, Internet Access router <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be linked to the customer WEB server <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by means of a first switching group <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a first bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a second switching group <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and first and second firewalls <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Likewise, Internet Access router <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is linked to customer WEB server <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by means of a third switching group <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a second bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the second switching group <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the first and second firewalls <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Each component of the server farm such a bandwidth controller or a firewall, may be duplicated as suggested by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, at each time, one of the two components may be active (e.g. the first bandwidth controller and the first firewall) whereas the other one may be a backup component (e.g. the second bandwidth controller and the second firewall). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Note that each switching group may include a plurality of switches wherein, at each time, only a subset of them is used to determine the path that connects a user to the customer WEB server. As to the other components of the server farm, each may be is duplicated to have, at each time, an active switch and a backup switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention includes a control system that may comprise two Service Level Agreement (SLA) servers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which are connected respectively to Internet Access servers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a fourth switching group <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Note that, at each time, one SLA server may be active and the other kept as backup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by the arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the active SLA server, e.g. SLA server <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, periodically sends a monitoring frame to both ISP routers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Static routes are configured in both SLA servers to reach the ISP routers with a next hop being Internet Access routers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively (via the fourth switching group <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). Note that such a frame can be sent periodically with a period of several minutes; the period may depend on the number of customer WEB servers the SLA servers monitor in the server farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Then, after receiving the monitoring frame from the SLA server, each ISP router answers back by forwarding an answer frame i.e., a response message to the SLA server, always by intermediary of the Internet Access router. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The above monitoring enables verification that the first half path between the server farm and the Internet network is up and running, and also enables measurement of the time necessary for a frame to be communicated between them. Such monitoring can be based upon a &ldquo;ping&rdquo; mechanism wherein an Internet Control Message protocol (ICMP) echo request message is sent to a specified destination. Any machine (such as a router) that receives an echo request formulates an echo reply response message and returns it to the original sender. The request contains an optional data area and the reply may contain a copy of the data sent in the request. The echo request ping and the associated reply message can be used to test whether a destination is reachable and responding. Because both the request and reply travel in IP datagrams, successful receipt of a reply verifies that major pieces of the transport system work. Thus, immediate gateways between the source and destination may be presumed to be operating correctly, and the destination machine running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The second step includes monitoring the availability of the second half path and the customer WEB server <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the SLA server and measuring the response time as illustrated by the arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> First, the active SLA server <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> sends a monitoring frame such as a ping to the customer WEB server. A default route is configured in both SLA servers to reach this address with a next hop being the virtual IP address of Internet Access routers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (via the fourth switching group <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). The two Internet Access routers may be configured in a mode that allows one to be active and the other to be in standby mode. In this case, the active router, for example router <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, responds to all the frames sent to the virtual IP address defined for the pair of routers. The goal is to use the same router as the one used by the end users when connecting to the farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The active Internet Access router <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forwards the received frames to the active bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (via the first switching group <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). Note that the bandwidth controllers may be configured in a mode that allows one of them, here bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, to be active, and the other one <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be in standby mode. In this case, active bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> responds to all the frames sent to the virtual IP address defined for the pair of controllers. The goal is to use the same bandwidth controller as the one used by the end users when connecting to the farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Then, the active bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forwards the frame to the active firewall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (via the second switching group <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). Note that the pair of firewalls <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may also be configured in a mode that allows one of them to be active, here firewall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the other one <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be in standby mode. In this case, the active firewall responds to all the frames sent to the virtual address defined for the pair of firewalls. The goal is to use the same firewall as the one used by the end user when connecting to the farm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The customer WEB server <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> receives the monitoring frame and responds to the active firewall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which in turn forwards the responding message to the active bandwidth controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The latter sends the response to the active Internet Access router <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which in turn forwards the frame back to the active SLA server <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which has initiated the monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As mentioned previously, the monitoring of the customer WEB server may be based upon a periodic &ldquo;ping&rdquo; mechanism that verifies that the second half path and the server are up and running from a hardware and basic operating system point of view. This monitoring may include periodic access to the home page of the WEB server (URL monitoring) in order to check whether the application running in the WEB server is also up and running. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Together with periodically monitoring that the second half path is up and running, response times are also gathered. The active SLA server may thus correlate the results from the monitoring and the response times of the two half paths and provide global statistics showing the availability and response time between the ISP routers and the customer WEB server. Note that the transmission time between Internet Access router <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (or Internet Access router <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) and the active SLA router, and reciprocally, must be subtracted from the response time measured by each pair of ping and response messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In case of failure on any link of the Internet Access Routers or the bandwidth Controllers or the Firewalls, an automatic backup may be performed from the active device to the backup device. As the monitoring flows use the virtual addresses all along the paths, these monitoring flows will automatically be backed up on the new active devices, just as the real connections coming from end users in the Internet, the objective being to always use the same path as end users connection for the monitoring flows. </paragraph>
